  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I&#039;m very happy to greet all of you wonderful students here this morning and your leaders, and I understand that you have a group of missionaries here, as you did a year ago when I spoke at a devotional; so being a missionary, I decided, when I was trying to decide what to speak about this morning, to tell you some of my mission experiences. I think that you&#039;ll get more out of that than if I tried to discuss any particular subject or principle of the gospel. If you don&#039;t think I could, read the books I&#039;ve written, and you&#039;ll know that I could.

First, I started way back in 1905 when I went on my first mission to Holland. My cousin and I rode together until we reached Liverpool, then he was sent up into Norway, the Land of the Midnight Sun, and I was sent into Holland. After we had been in the mission field a few months, I received a letter from him calling me by name, and he said, &quot;I met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I&#039;ve ever dreamed of knowing, and I told him if he had something better than I had, I&#039;d join his church.&quot;

So I wrote him back and called him by name, and I said, &quot;If he has something better than you have, you &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to join his church, but does he have something better than a personal visitation to this earth after centuries of darkness by God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ to usher in the dispensation of the fullness of times and to reveal the real personalities of God and his Son Jesus Christ? Does he have something better than the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, which gives us the history of God&#039;s dealings with his prophets in this land of America over a period of a thousand years? Does he have something better than the coming back to this earth of John the Baptist, who was beheaded for his testimony of Jesus, to restore the Aaronic Priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins? Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John, who were upon the Mount of Transfiguration with the Savior and returned to this earth to restore the holy priesthood, the power of the apostleship, the power to organize the church and kingdom of God upon the earth? Does he have something better than the coming of Moses with the keys of the gathering of latter-day Israel? Does he have something better than the coming of Elijah the prophet, of whose coming Malachi testified that before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, the Lord would send Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest he come and smite the whole earth with a curse? Now that&#039;s an important mission.&quot; I said, &quot;If he has something better than that, you ought to join his church.&quot;

I tell the missionaries that, if you learn how to tell our story, you never need to argue with anybody. You tell them things they&#039;ve never heard of, and you prove them out of the Lord&#039;s holy scriptures.

When I was president of the Southern States Mission, I preached a sermon down in Quitman, Georgia, on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I quoted from Rulon Howell&#039;s book&lt;i&gt;Do Men Believe What Their Churches Prescribe?&lt;/i&gt; Along one side he has the names of all the important subjects and across the top the names of various large churches of the world. I read from that book. Not one of the major churches believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. As the meeting closed, I stood at the door shaking hands with the people who were there. A man came up and introduced himself as a Baptist minister, and I said, &quot;Did I misquote you here tonight?&quot;

&quot;No, Mr. Richards,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s like you say; we don&#039;t all believe all the things that our churches teach.&quot;

I said, &quot;You don&#039;t believe them either. Why don&#039;t you go back and teach your people the truth. They&#039;ll take it from you, and they&#039;re not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.&quot;

He said, &quot;I&#039;ll see you again.&quot;

I didn&#039;t see him for about four months until I went back to that branch. My coming was announced in the newspaper, and as I walked to that little church, there stood that Baptist minister. As we shook hands, I said, &quot;I&#039;d certainly be interested to know what you thought of my talk the last time I was here.&quot;

He said, &quot;Mr. Richards, I&#039;ve been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I&#039;d like to have heard the rest of it.&quot; Now you know we never get talked out when we get talking about the principles of the gospel. There was a man occupying a pulpit in the Baptist Church who believed every word I&#039;d said, and yet he couldn&#039;t preach it to his people.

In the Book of Mormon we read about when Lehi was in the desert. He told his son Joseph that the Lord had promised Joseph who was sold into Egypt that in the latter days he would raise up a prophet from his loins whose name would be Joseph and whose father&#039;s name would be Joseph. (Now obviously that was Joseph Smith.) The Lord said about him:

[That prophet shall] &lt;i&gt;bring forth my word&lt;/i&gt;. [2 Nephi 3:11]

The Prophet Joseph brought us the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and many other writings. He has given us more revealed truth than any other prophet who has ever lived upon the face of the earth as far as our records are concerned. That was written in the Book of Mormon before this Church was ever organized.

Then he said,

&lt;i&gt;Not to the bringing forth my word only . . . but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 3:11]

What did he mean by that? That in this world, where there are hundreds of different churches preaching men&#039;s interpretation of the scriptures, the Lord would give this new prophet an understanding of the scriptures to reveal them in the spirit in which they were written. Then he said:

&lt;i&gt;For the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Nephi 3:15]

Why? Because this prophet would be clothed upon by the holy priesthood, the power to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel.

Then the Lord adds:

&lt;i&gt;And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Nephi 3:8]

Whatever the world may think of this prophet of this dispensation, there&#039;s the testimony of the Lord that he shall be great in his eyes.

Now, referring to the statement about &quot;convincing them of my word which shall have already gone forth among them,&quot; I want to tell you of a little experience I had when I was in Holland. I had an invitation from some businessmen to attend one of their Bible classes. They met every week in one of the homes. We met that week in the home of a prominent furniture dealer. There were about 20 men there, and the only woman was the daughter of the man of the house. They gave me an hour and a half to discuss universal salvation, which includes our doctrine of preaching the gospel in the eternal worlds to the spirits that were disobedient here upon the earth and the doctrine of baptism of the living for the dead. So after I had discussed that matter, I just gave them chapter and verse and let them read it in their own copies of the Bible. I figured that they would believe it more if they read it in their Bible; otherwise, they would think that I had a different Bible. When I was through, I laid my Bible on the table and folded my arms and waited for a comment.

The first comment came from the daughter of the man of the house. She said, &quot;Father, I just can&#039;t understand it. I have never attended one of these Bible classes in my life when you haven&#039;t had the last word to say on everything, and tonight you haven&#039;t said a word.&quot;

He shook his head and said, &quot;My daughter, there isn&#039;t anything to say. This man has been teaching us things we have never heard of, and he&#039;s been teaching them to us out of our own Bible.&quot; That&#039;s what the Lord meant when he said that the prophet of this dispensation would not only bring forth his words, but would convince people of his words that had already gone forth among them.

Along that line, some years ago the congregational and evangelical churches of these western states—California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada—were holding a conference of their leaders and ministers in Salt Lake. The leader of the group wrote a letter to President McKay and asked him if he would send one of the General Authorities of the Church to attend the morning session of their conference and tell them the story of Mormonism, to be their guest for lunch, and to remain for an hour and a half in the afternoon and let them ask questions. I got the assignment, and I don&#039;t mind telling you that I was happy to get it. I tell the missionaries you&#039;ll never need to argue with anybody if you learn how to tell our story and you keep the lead. So when I arrived I said, &quot;Do you want it just the way we got our Church and what we believe?&quot;

The man in charge said, &quot;That&#039;s just what we want.&quot;

Some of them wanted to get away on earlier planes to the Northwest, so they set the luncheon back half an hour so that they could give me two and a half hours in that morning meeting. I presented our message to them just about the same way that I have presented it in &lt;i&gt;A Marvelous Work and a Wonder&lt;/i&gt;, which many of you have read, showing what we got by revelation rather than by reformation. The churches of this world have not been able to agree because they have not understood the scriptures as they have tried to interpret them; and no two of them can agree, so that has brought into the world many churches. But we have a gospel that has come directly from heaven. When I wrote &lt;i&gt;A Marvelous Work and a Wonder&lt;/i&gt;, I predicated it on the thought that we are the only Christian church in the world that didn&#039;t get our religion out of the Bible; we got it by revelation from heaven; then we use the Bible to prove that what we have is what we should have.

After I had presented what we got by revelation (and I&#039;ve already referred to a little of that when I told you about my cousin who was in Norway), I said, &quot;While I was the presiding bishop of the Church, we directed the building program of the Church. We had the plans prepared for the Los Angeles Temple. One day we showed those plans to the First Presidency. We had 84 pages about 4 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide. We didn&#039;t have the electric plans or the plumbing plans complete, and yet there was that temple built spiritually, and there was not a hole in the ground. You could take those plans and go all over the world and try to fit them to every building in the world, but there&#039;s only one building they would fit, and that&#039;s the Mormon temple in Los Angeles. Of course, you could find buildings that have material in them like the material in that temple, such as lumber, cement, tiling, electrical wiring, and plumbing, but you can&#039;t find any other building in the world that those plans will fit except the Mormon temple in Los Angeles.&quot;

Then I held up the Bible and said, &quot;Here&#039;s the Lord&#039;s blueprint. Isaiah said the Lord had declared the end from the beginning. It&#039;s all here when you know how to understand it. Isaiah said,

&lt;i&gt;The grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand forever.&lt;/i&gt; [40:8]

You could take this, the Lord&#039;s blueprint, and try to fit it to every church in this world, but there&#039;s only one church that it will fit, and that&#039;s The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Of course, you can find other churches that have some of the same things in them like are in this blueprint, but you can&#039;t find any other church that this, the Lord&#039;s blueprint, will fit.&quot;

Then I said, &quot;Now, I&#039;ll proceed to illustrate to you what I mean. In Farrar&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Life of Christ&lt;/i&gt;, he said there were two passages in the New Testament for which he could find no excuse. The first was John 10:16, where Jesus said,

&lt;i&gt;Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.&lt;/i&gt;

I said, &quot;Do any of you men know why that is in the Bible?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Do any of you know any church in the world that does know why it&#039;s in the Bible?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Well, we know all about it.&quot; Then I tied it to what I&#039;d told them about the promise of Moses to Joseph who was sold into Egypt of a new land separated from his brethren in the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, and, describing that land, Moses used the word &lt;i&gt;precious&lt;/i&gt; five times in just four little verses (see Deuteronomy 33:13–16).

&quot;Do any of you know where the land of Joseph is?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Do any of you know where any church in the world that does know where it is?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Well, we know all about it,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#039;s the land of America.&quot; And then I led up to where the Lord commanded Ezekiel that the two records should be kept, one of Judah and his followers, the house of Israel, and one of Joseph and his followers, the house of Israel, and in the days of their children—that is in the latter days—when they would say,

&lt;i&gt;Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand&lt;/i&gt;. [Ezekiel 37:18–19]

&quot;Do any of you,&quot; I said, &quot;know where that stick or record of Joseph is that the Lord commanded should be written?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Well, we know all about it; it&#039;s the Book of Mormon. And when you get the Book of Mormon, you read about when Jesus visited his people here in the land of America, when he told them that they were the other sheep of whom he spoke to his disciples in Jerusalem. He said never at any time had the Lord commanded him to tell his disciples who the other sheep were, only that he had other sheep that were not of that fold.&quot; See how beautifully the scriptures fit together when you understand them?

The second passage that Canon Farrar couldn&#039;t understand is 1 Corinthians 15:29, where Paul said:

&lt;i&gt;Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?&lt;/i&gt;

I said, &quot;Do any of you know why that is in the Bible?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Do any of you know of any church in the world that does know why that&#039;s in the Bible?&quot;

No answer.

&quot;Well, we know all about it.&quot; Then I told them that Peter said that Jesus was

&lt;i&gt;put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Which sometime were disobedient . . . in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. &lt;/i&gt;[1 Peter 3:18–20]

&quot;Now,&quot; I said, &quot;obviously if Jesus preached to them, his gospel was faith, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. And since you can&#039;t baptize a spirit in water, the Lord had to give them a vicarious baptism of the living for the dead so that holy and sacred ordinance could be performed for them.&quot; I went on to point out that Peter said,

&lt;i&gt;For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. &lt;/i&gt;[1 Peter 4:6]

That helps you to understand what Jesus meant when he said:

&lt;i&gt;The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. &lt;/i&gt;[John 5:25]

The world has interpreted that to mean those who are dead in sin, but Jesus amplified it by saying:

&lt;i&gt;Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice. &lt;/i&gt;[John 5:28]

See how beautifully that fits together?

Then I gave those men some more passages concerning the kingdom that God was to set up in the latter days and the heavens that were to receive the Christ until the restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began and then the angel that was to bring the gospel in the latter days to be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; and in each one I would say, &quot;Do you know why these passages are in the scripture as part of the Lord&#039;s blueprint? Do you know any church in the world that claims that these things have been fulfilled?&quot; Do you see how beautifully the gospel and all these beautiful fulfillments of the words of the holy prophets fit together?

Toward the close of my remarks, the man in charge said, &quot;Now, Mr. Richards, we&#039;ve heard it said that you believe God has a wife. Would you explain that to us?&quot; I think he thought he had me over a barrel or in a corner that I couldn&#039;t get out of.

Rather facetiously I said, &quot;Well, I don&#039;t see how in the world God could have a son without a wife, do you?&quot; They all began to twitter, and I didn&#039;t have any trouble with that question.

Those ministers and church leaders wanted to have an hour and a half to ask questions, and after they had listened to me for two and a half hours, I got that one question from them, and that was the only one. The man in charge said when I left them, &quot;Mr. Richards, this has been one of the most interesting experiences of my entire life.&quot; No wonder Isaiah said it would be a marvelous work and a wonder. That&#039;s what it is to me, and that&#039;s what every missionary ought to make it be to those who are yet in darkness.

Now, I&#039;ll tell you a little experience. I had a debate with a minister in Amsterdam when I was on my first mission. One of the Saints invited me to come to her home. She wanted to invite her neighbor in and let me preach the gospel to her. When my companion and I went to that home, the neighbor was there, but she brought her minister with her. Well, we had a little difference of opinion on the discussion of the priesthood, and right there he challenged me for a debate in his church. I was young and had a lot of umph in me, and I accepted the challenge. We were not advised in those days not to debate.

When we arrived in his church on Saturday night according to our appointment, that church was full. All of his people were there, and all of our people were there. I didn&#039;t know how our people found it out; I didn&#039;t tell them. He stood up and said, &quot;Now inasmuch as Mr. Richards is a guest in our church, we&#039;ll accord him the privilege of opening the debate. We&#039;ll each talk for twenty minutes and continue as long as it is mutually agreeable. Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Richards?&quot;

I said, &quot;Very much so.&quot; I didn&#039;t tell him, but I would have given him the shirt off my back for the privilege of opening that debate, and he just handed it to me on a silver platter. I didn&#039;t know whether the Lord had anything to do with that or not, but I always thought he did.

I stood up and said, &quot;The last time I talked to my friend here, we had a difference of opinion on the principle of priesthood. I&#039;ve come here tonight prepared to discuss that subject, but I don&#039;t propose to start at that point. If you were going to build a house, you wouldn&#039;t try to put the roof on it until you got the foundation in because if a foundation were faulty, it wouldn&#039;t do you any good to put the roof on because the house would fall. I propose to open this debate by laying the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I choose for my text the sixth chapter of Hebrews where Paul said:

&lt;i&gt;Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.&lt;/i&gt; [Hebrews 6:1–2]

I hurried over faith and repentance because I thought they believed them. I spiked down baptism by immersion for the remission of sins until everybody in the audience was giving me approval. Then I came to the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. They didn&#039;t believe that. They thought the Holy Ghost came just like the breezes that blow over your head. You remember when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God through the preaching of Philip. They sent Peter and John to them, and when they came, they prayed for those men. They laid their lands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And when Simon the sorcerer saw that the Holy Ghost was conveyed by the laying on of the apostle&#039;s hands, he offered them money, saying:

&lt;i&gt;Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. &lt;/i&gt;[Acts 8:19–20]

Then I gave another reference or two about the laying on of hands out of the Bible and sat down. &quot;My friend&quot; stood up. He never mentioned a word I&#039;d said. He started on the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the Golden Bible and the fact that Joseph Smith admitted that he&#039;d made many mistakes, and then he turned to me and said, &quot;Now if Mr. Richards will explain these matters, this audience will be most appreciative.&quot;

I was on my feet just like that. (My companion said, &quot;How did you think so fast?&quot; and I said, &quot;What have you been praying for all week?&quot;) I stood on my feet and said, &quot;In the days of the Savior, his enemies tried to trick him with cunningness and craftiness. I don&#039;t suppose there is anybody here today that would like to see us resort to those old tactics. This friend of mine offered me the courtesy of opening this debate as a guest in his church, and now he wants to steal from me the very courtesy that he extended me, and I don&#039;t propose to let him do it. So, my friend, you may have your twenty minutes over again.&quot;

He couldn&#039;t do it, and he knew he couldn&#039;t. His wife stood up in the audience and said, &quot;What Mr. Richards is asking is fair; you ought to answer him.&quot; Even then he couldn&#039;t do it.

I said to my companion, &quot;Stand up and give me my coat and hat.&quot; It was wintertime. I said, &quot;I am willing to remain here till 10 o&#039;clock tomorrow morning, when I have to be in my own church, provided this debate can go forward on the basis that you set up, but if not, I&#039;m going to leave and ask my companion to leave and ask our Saints to leave, and we&#039;ll leave it to you to settle with your people what&#039;s happened here tonight.&quot; He still couldn&#039;t do it, so we all walked out on him. I met him on the street time and time again after that, and he always ducked his head so he wouldn&#039;t have to speak to me.

Now, brothers and sisters, as you&#039;ve listened to me this morning, I think you can understand why I tell our missionaries you never need to argue with anybody if you learn the sweetest story that has been told in this world since the resurrection of the Christ. It is true, and that is my testimony to you. I pray God to help you to do your part to share it with those who are yet in darkness, and I leave you my love and blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I&#8217;m very happy to greet all of you wonderful students here this morning and your leaders, and I understand that you have a group of missionaries here, as you did a year ago when I spoke at a devotional; so being a missionary, I decided, when I was trying to decide what to speak about this morning, to tell you some of my mission experiences. I think that you&#8217;ll get more out of that than if I tried to discuss any particular subject or principle of the gospel. If you don&#8217;t think I could, read the books I&#8217;ve written, and you&#8217;ll know that I could.</p>
<p>First, I started way back in 1905 when I went on my first mission to Holland. My cousin and I rode together until we reached Liverpool, then he was sent up into Norway, the Land of the Midnight Sun, and I was sent into Holland. After we had been in the mission field a few months, I received a letter from him calling me by name, and he said, &#8220;I met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I&#8217;ve ever dreamed of knowing, and I told him if he had something better than I had, I&#8217;d join his church.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I wrote him back and called him by name, and I said, &#8220;If he has something better than you have, you <i>ought</i> to join his church, but does he have something better than a personal visitation to this earth after centuries of darkness by God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ to usher in the dispensation of the fullness of times and to reveal the real personalities of God and his Son Jesus Christ? Does he have something better than the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, which gives us the history of God&#8217;s dealings with his prophets in this land of America over a period of a thousand years? Does he have something better than the coming back to this earth of John the Baptist, who was beheaded for his testimony of Jesus, to restore the Aaronic Priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins? Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John, who were upon the Mount of Transfiguration with the Savior and returned to this earth to restore the holy priesthood, the power of the apostleship, the power to organize the church and kingdom of God upon the earth? Does he have something better than the coming of Moses with the keys of the gathering of latter-day Israel? Does he have something better than the coming of Elijah the prophet, of whose coming Malachi testified that before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, the Lord would send Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest he come and smite the whole earth with a curse? Now that&#8217;s an important mission.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If he has something better than that, you ought to join his church.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tell the missionaries that, if you learn how to tell our story, you never need to argue with anybody. You tell them things they&#8217;ve never heard of, and you prove them out of the Lord&#8217;s holy scriptures.</p>
<p>When I was president of the Southern States Mission, I preached a sermon down in Quitman, Georgia, on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I quoted from Rulon Howell&#8217;s book<i>Do Men Believe What Their Churches Prescribe?</i> Along one side he has the names of all the important subjects and across the top the names of various large churches of the world. I read from that book. Not one of the major churches believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. As the meeting closed, I stood at the door shaking hands with the people who were there. A man came up and introduced himself as a Baptist minister, and I said, &#8220;Did I misquote you here tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Richards,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like you say; we don&#8217;t all believe all the things that our churches teach.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t believe them either. Why don&#8217;t you go back and teach your people the truth. They&#8217;ll take it from you, and they&#8217;re not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see him for about four months until I went back to that branch. My coming was announced in the newspaper, and as I walked to that little church, there stood that Baptist minister. As we shook hands, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d certainly be interested to know what you thought of my talk the last time I was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;Mr. Richards, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I&#8217;d like to have heard the rest of it.&#8221; Now you know we never get talked out when we get talking about the principles of the gospel. There was a man occupying a pulpit in the Baptist Church who believed every word I&#8217;d said, and yet he couldn&#8217;t preach it to his people.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon we read about when Lehi was in the desert. He told his son Joseph that the Lord had promised Joseph who was sold into Egypt that in the latter days he would raise up a prophet from his loins whose name would be Joseph and whose father&#8217;s name would be Joseph. (Now obviously that was Joseph Smith.) The Lord said about him:</p>
<p>[That prophet shall] <i>bring forth my word</i>. [2 Nephi 3:11]</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph brought us the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and many other writings. He has given us more revealed truth than any other prophet who has ever lived upon the face of the earth as far as our records are concerned. That was written in the Book of Mormon before this Church was ever organized.</p>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<p><i>Not to the bringing forth my word only . . . but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.</i> [2 Nephi 3:11]</p>
<p>What did he mean by that? That in this world, where there are hundreds of different churches preaching men&#8217;s interpretation of the scriptures, the Lord would give this new prophet an understanding of the scriptures to reveal them in the spirit in which they were written. Then he said:</p>
<p><i>For the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation. </i>[2 Nephi 3:15]</p>
<p>Why? Because this prophet would be clothed upon by the holy priesthood, the power to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel.</p>
<p>Then the Lord adds:</p>
<p><i>And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work. </i>[2 Nephi 3:8]</p>
<p>Whatever the world may think of this prophet of this dispensation, there&#8217;s the testimony of the Lord that he shall be great in his eyes.</p>
<p>Now, referring to the statement about &#8220;convincing them of my word which shall have already gone forth among them,&#8221; I want to tell you of a little experience I had when I was in Holland. I had an invitation from some businessmen to attend one of their Bible classes. They met every week in one of the homes. We met that week in the home of a prominent furniture dealer. There were about 20 men there, and the only woman was the daughter of the man of the house. They gave me an hour and a half to discuss universal salvation, which includes our doctrine of preaching the gospel in the eternal worlds to the spirits that were disobedient here upon the earth and the doctrine of baptism of the living for the dead. So after I had discussed that matter, I just gave them chapter and verse and let them read it in their own copies of the Bible. I figured that they would believe it more if they read it in their Bible; otherwise, they would think that I had a different Bible. When I was through, I laid my Bible on the table and folded my arms and waited for a comment.</p>
<p>The first comment came from the daughter of the man of the house. She said, &#8220;Father, I just can&#8217;t understand it. I have never attended one of these Bible classes in my life when you haven&#8217;t had the last word to say on everything, and tonight you haven&#8217;t said a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head and said, &#8220;My daughter, there isn&#8217;t anything to say. This man has been teaching us things we have never heard of, and he&#8217;s been teaching them to us out of our own Bible.&#8221; That&#8217;s what the Lord meant when he said that the prophet of this dispensation would not only bring forth his words, but would convince people of his words that had already gone forth among them.</p>
<p>Along that line, some years ago the congregational and evangelical churches of these western states—California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada—were holding a conference of their leaders and ministers in Salt Lake. The leader of the group wrote a letter to President McKay and asked him if he would send one of the General Authorities of the Church to attend the morning session of their conference and tell them the story of Mormonism, to be their guest for lunch, and to remain for an hour and a half in the afternoon and let them ask questions. I got the assignment, and I don&#8217;t mind telling you that I was happy to get it. I tell the missionaries you&#8217;ll never need to argue with anybody if you learn how to tell our story and you keep the lead. So when I arrived I said, &#8220;Do you want it just the way we got our Church and what we believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man in charge said, &#8220;That&#8217;s just what we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of them wanted to get away on earlier planes to the Northwest, so they set the luncheon back half an hour so that they could give me two and a half hours in that morning meeting. I presented our message to them just about the same way that I have presented it in <i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, which many of you have read, showing what we got by revelation rather than by reformation. The churches of this world have not been able to agree because they have not understood the scriptures as they have tried to interpret them; and no two of them can agree, so that has brought into the world many churches. But we have a gospel that has come directly from heaven. When I wrote <i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, I predicated it on the thought that we are the only Christian church in the world that didn&#8217;t get our religion out of the Bible; we got it by revelation from heaven; then we use the Bible to prove that what we have is what we should have.</p>
<p>After I had presented what we got by revelation (and I&#8217;ve already referred to a little of that when I told you about my cousin who was in Norway), I said, &#8220;While I was the presiding bishop of the Church, we directed the building program of the Church. We had the plans prepared for the Los Angeles Temple. One day we showed those plans to the First Presidency. We had 84 pages about 4 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide. We didn&#8217;t have the electric plans or the plumbing plans complete, and yet there was that temple built spiritually, and there was not a hole in the ground. You could take those plans and go all over the world and try to fit them to every building in the world, but there&#8217;s only one building they would fit, and that&#8217;s the Mormon temple in Los Angeles. Of course, you could find buildings that have material in them like the material in that temple, such as lumber, cement, tiling, electrical wiring, and plumbing, but you can&#8217;t find any other building in the world that those plans will fit except the Mormon temple in Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I held up the Bible and said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the Lord&#8217;s blueprint. Isaiah said the Lord had declared the end from the beginning. It&#8217;s all here when you know how to understand it. Isaiah said,</p>
<p><i>The grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand forever.</i> [40:8]</p>
<p>You could take this, the Lord&#8217;s blueprint, and try to fit it to every church in this world, but there&#8217;s only one church that it will fit, and that&#8217;s The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Of course, you can find other churches that have some of the same things in them like are in this blueprint, but you can&#8217;t find any other church that this, the Lord&#8217;s blueprint, will fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I said, &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll proceed to illustrate to you what I mean. In Farrar&#8217;s <i>Life of Christ</i>, he said there were two passages in the New Testament for which he could find no excuse. The first was John 10:16, where Jesus said,</p>
<p><i>Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</i></p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Do any of you men know why that is in the Bible?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do any of you know any church in the world that does know why it&#8217;s in the Bible?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we know all about it.&#8221; Then I tied it to what I&#8217;d told them about the promise of Moses to Joseph who was sold into Egypt of a new land separated from his brethren in the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, and, describing that land, Moses used the word <i>precious</i> five times in just four little verses (see Deuteronomy 33:13–16).</p>
<p>&#8220;Do any of you know where the land of Joseph is?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do any of you know where any church in the world that does know where it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we know all about it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the land of America.&#8221; And then I led up to where the Lord commanded Ezekiel that the two records should be kept, one of Judah and his followers, the house of Israel, and one of Joseph and his followers, the house of Israel, and in the days of their children—that is in the latter days—when they would say,</p>
<p><i>Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?</i></p>
<p><i>Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand</i>. [Ezekiel 37:18–19]</p>
<p>&#8220;Do any of you,&#8221; I said, &#8220;know where that stick or record of Joseph is that the Lord commanded should be written?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we know all about it; it&#8217;s the Book of Mormon. And when you get the Book of Mormon, you read about when Jesus visited his people here in the land of America, when he told them that they were the other sheep of whom he spoke to his disciples in Jerusalem. He said never at any time had the Lord commanded him to tell his disciples who the other sheep were, only that he had other sheep that were not of that fold.&#8221; See how beautifully the scriptures fit together when you understand them?</p>
<p>The second passage that Canon Farrar couldn&#8217;t understand is 1 Corinthians 15:29, where Paul said:</p>
<p><i>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</i></p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Do any of you know why that is in the Bible?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do any of you know of any church in the world that does know why that&#8217;s in the Bible?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we know all about it.&#8221; Then I told them that Peter said that Jesus was</p>
<p><i>put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</i></p>
<p><i>By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</i></p>
<p><i>Which sometime were disobedient . . . in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. </i>[1 Peter 3:18–20]</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; I said, &#8220;obviously if Jesus preached to them, his gospel was faith, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. And since you can&#8217;t baptize a spirit in water, the Lord had to give them a vicarious baptism of the living for the dead so that holy and sacred ordinance could be performed for them.&#8221; I went on to point out that Peter said,</p>
<p><i>For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. </i>[1 Peter 4:6]</p>
<p>That helps you to understand what Jesus meant when he said:</p>
<p><i>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. </i>[John 5:25]</p>
<p>The world has interpreted that to mean those who are dead in sin, but Jesus amplified it by saying:</p>
<p><i>Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice. </i>[John 5:28]</p>
<p>See how beautifully that fits together?</p>
<p>Then I gave those men some more passages concerning the kingdom that God was to set up in the latter days and the heavens that were to receive the Christ until the restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began and then the angel that was to bring the gospel in the latter days to be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; and in each one I would say, &#8220;Do you know why these passages are in the scripture as part of the Lord&#8217;s blueprint? Do you know any church in the world that claims that these things have been fulfilled?&#8221; Do you see how beautifully the gospel and all these beautiful fulfillments of the words of the holy prophets fit together?</p>
<p>Toward the close of my remarks, the man in charge said, &#8220;Now, Mr. Richards, we&#8217;ve heard it said that you believe God has a wife. Would you explain that to us?&#8221; I think he thought he had me over a barrel or in a corner that I couldn&#8217;t get out of.</p>
<p>Rather facetiously I said, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see how in the world God could have a son without a wife, do you?&#8221; They all began to twitter, and I didn&#8217;t have any trouble with that question.</p>
<p>Those ministers and church leaders wanted to have an hour and a half to ask questions, and after they had listened to me for two and a half hours, I got that one question from them, and that was the only one. The man in charge said when I left them, &#8220;Mr. Richards, this has been one of the most interesting experiences of my entire life.&#8221; No wonder Isaiah said it would be a marvelous work and a wonder. That&#8217;s what it is to me, and that&#8217;s what every missionary ought to make it be to those who are yet in darkness.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll tell you a little experience. I had a debate with a minister in Amsterdam when I was on my first mission. One of the Saints invited me to come to her home. She wanted to invite her neighbor in and let me preach the gospel to her. When my companion and I went to that home, the neighbor was there, but she brought her minister with her. Well, we had a little difference of opinion on the discussion of the priesthood, and right there he challenged me for a debate in his church. I was young and had a lot of umph in me, and I accepted the challenge. We were not advised in those days not to debate.</p>
<p>When we arrived in his church on Saturday night according to our appointment, that church was full. All of his people were there, and all of our people were there. I didn&#8217;t know how our people found it out; I didn&#8217;t tell them. He stood up and said, &#8220;Now inasmuch as Mr. Richards is a guest in our church, we&#8217;ll accord him the privilege of opening the debate. We&#8217;ll each talk for twenty minutes and continue as long as it is mutually agreeable. Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Richards?&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Very much so.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t tell him, but I would have given him the shirt off my back for the privilege of opening that debate, and he just handed it to me on a silver platter. I didn&#8217;t know whether the Lord had anything to do with that or not, but I always thought he did.</p>
<p>I stood up and said, &#8220;The last time I talked to my friend here, we had a difference of opinion on the principle of priesthood. I&#8217;ve come here tonight prepared to discuss that subject, but I don&#8217;t propose to start at that point. If you were going to build a house, you wouldn&#8217;t try to put the roof on it until you got the foundation in because if a foundation were faulty, it wouldn&#8217;t do you any good to put the roof on because the house would fall. I propose to open this debate by laying the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I choose for my text the sixth chapter of Hebrews where Paul said:</p>
<p><i>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</i> [Hebrews 6:1–2]</p>
<p>I hurried over faith and repentance because I thought they believed them. I spiked down baptism by immersion for the remission of sins until everybody in the audience was giving me approval. Then I came to the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. They didn&#8217;t believe that. They thought the Holy Ghost came just like the breezes that blow over your head. You remember when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God through the preaching of Philip. They sent Peter and John to them, and when they came, they prayed for those men. They laid their lands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And when Simon the sorcerer saw that the Holy Ghost was conveyed by the laying on of the apostle&#8217;s hands, he offered them money, saying:</p>
<p><i>Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</i></p>
<p><i>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. </i>[Acts 8:19–20]</p>
<p>Then I gave another reference or two about the laying on of hands out of the Bible and sat down. &#8220;My friend&#8221; stood up. He never mentioned a word I&#8217;d said. He started on the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the Golden Bible and the fact that Joseph Smith admitted that he&#8217;d made many mistakes, and then he turned to me and said, &#8220;Now if Mr. Richards will explain these matters, this audience will be most appreciative.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was on my feet just like that. (My companion said, &#8220;How did you think so fast?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;What have you been praying for all week?&#8221;) I stood on my feet and said, &#8220;In the days of the Savior, his enemies tried to trick him with cunningness and craftiness. I don&#8217;t suppose there is anybody here today that would like to see us resort to those old tactics. This friend of mine offered me the courtesy of opening this debate as a guest in his church, and now he wants to steal from me the very courtesy that he extended me, and I don&#8217;t propose to let him do it. So, my friend, you may have your twenty minutes over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t do it, and he knew he couldn&#8217;t. His wife stood up in the audience and said, &#8220;What Mr. Richards is asking is fair; you ought to answer him.&#8221; Even then he couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>I said to my companion, &#8220;Stand up and give me my coat and hat.&#8221; It was wintertime. I said, &#8220;I am willing to remain here till 10 o&#8217;clock tomorrow morning, when I have to be in my own church, provided this debate can go forward on the basis that you set up, but if not, I&#8217;m going to leave and ask my companion to leave and ask our Saints to leave, and we&#8217;ll leave it to you to settle with your people what&#8217;s happened here tonight.&#8221; He still couldn&#8217;t do it, so we all walked out on him. I met him on the street time and time again after that, and he always ducked his head so he wouldn&#8217;t have to speak to me.</p>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, as you&#8217;ve listened to me this morning, I think you can understand why I tell our missionaries you never need to argue with anybody if you learn the sweetest story that has been told in this world since the resurrection of the Christ. It is true, and that is my testimony to you. I pray God to help you to do your part to share it with those who are yet in darkness, and I leave you my love and blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a blessing and an honor to be asked to speak to you today. I never dreamed of having such a great opportunity as this, and I pray that the Spirit will be with both of us. I am just a country kid from Moroni, Utah, so this is extraordinary for me.
As I prayed about what I should talk about today, I had many topics come into my mind. It was hard to decide what would be best for you as well as something I’m passionate about. The letter I received said that I should pick a topic that is important to me.
One of my favorite candies is M&amp;M’s, and one of my favorite interests is missionary work. So, with those in mind, I started to think of the M&amp;M’s of missionary-minded members, for that is what I am involved in as a stake president.
1. Miraculous Conversion
The first M&amp;M that I want to address is miraculous conversion.When I hear that phrase I think of Alma, Ammon, Wilford Woodruff, Paul, and other great missionaries, and then I think, “That’s way above me,” and I turn it off. But this is the start of the sweetness of missionary desires.
I came from a family in Moroni that wasn’t active. I can’t remember sitting in a ­sacrament meeting with my mom and dad. My dad would always pound on the furnace register to make sure I got up for church, but there were long stretches when I can’t remember going to church. My dad was a schoolteacher, so in the summers we’d go fishing or hiking or camping or anything else—just not church. One time, after being gone all summer, I went to church, and Veldon Blackburn, a friend of mine, asked why I had gone inactive. I told him I wasn’t inactive; I just didn’t come to church.
During the summer a few years later I worked hard to be the best and get the best job in Moroni, which was working on the vaccination crew for the Moroni Feed Company. I worked really hard and made the crew. We could go through a flock of ten thousand turkeys in an hour and not lose one. One time we were vaccinating some turkeys up by Fountain Green, and they were just a little bigger than usual. We were taking them out of the brooder coop, vaccinating them, putting them into a truck, and taking them out to the growing pens. We had finished vaccinating about half the flock when I grabbed a turkey, gave it a shot, and threw it up into the truck. As I grabbed another turkey, the last turkey decided it didn’t want to be in the truck, so it came out and hit me in the back of my arm, and I gave myself the next shot in my hand between my thumb and index finger. I will now never get fowl cholera, erysipelas, or Newcastle disease.
I grew a big abscess about the size of a ­tennis ball in the palm of my hand, so I went to the family doctor, Dr. Speakman, in Mount Pleasant. After a few months of lancing the abscess and getting the gunk out of it, the doctor said he would have to take three of my fingers off to save my hand. I’m kind of attached </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As I look at you graduates, tender feelings well up inside me. While it is not possible for me to shake hands with each of you and look you in the eye personally, I want you to know that you are precious in the sight of your Heavenly Father. He loves you. The leaders of the Church love you.
I also want you to know that you have an exciting and meaningful service to the Lord ahead of you. I recognize that years of sacrifice by your parents, as well as by each of you, have helped you become who you are. Today I look at you and recognize your own years of commitment to the Church and to nourishing your own testimonies through study and application of gospel principles. I look at you and see the future of the Church—not just the future bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and auxiliary leaders but the great ranks of future mothers and fathers, Primary and Sunday School teachers, youth leaders, home teachers, visiting teachers, Scout leaders, choir directors, and countless others who will serve the Lord in the 21st century.
It will be a different century than the one that has just passed. In some ways it will be better; in other ways it will be much more difficult for you and for your children. But one thing is inescapable: it will be your century—one in which you have the opportunity to leave your mark for good or otherwise. You will try to influence others, and others will try to influence you. Either you will share and promote your core values, rooted in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, or you will allow others to define your values for you and your posterity.
Communication in the future will continue to change through Internet and new media technologies. Your world of cyberspace—cell phones that capture video downloads, iTunes, social networks like Facebook, text messaging, blogs, Twitter, handhelds, and podcasts—is just the beginning of what is yet ahead for you in the remarkable expansion of technology. It makes me wish I had been born 20 years later so that I could figure out how to run my iPhone when it doesn’t behave, which is quite often.
We are in a titanic struggle, my young brothers and sisters. From the dawn of mankind’s history it has always been so. Good and evil have always been with us, and so has the right to choose between them. For the time I have with you today, I want to share some thoughts about standing firm for the truth.
Recently I saw some research about how other people see members of the Church. I have long been interested in this subject because I have had somewhat to do with missionary work in my Church assignments. Knowing how people see us is an important part of understanding how best to explain ourselves. This particular piece of research made an interesting observation. It suggested that members of our Church can sometimes appear very defensive to those who are not members of the Church. One respondent went so far as to say that when Mormons are</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I consider it a great privilege and responsibility to be given this opportunity to speak to you. After I received this assignment from the First Presidency, I asked President Samuelson what I should talk about.
He said, “You are the executive director of the Missionary Department. Why don’t you talk about missionary work?”
I have decided to follow his counsel.
You are a magnificent sight! Many of you are recently returned from full-time missions. Many of you will soon be full-time missionaries. I hope all of you are committed to being lifelong missionaries.
Some feel this is a difficult time to do missionary work. A Gallup Poll three weeks ago found 46 percent of Americans view “Mormons” unfavorably, 11 percent don’t know who we are, and 18 percent think of polygamy when our name is mentioned.1
Let’s put this in perspective. In 1842 John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, wrote to Joseph Smith requesting information about the Church. The Church had been organized 12 years earlier and had just over 20,000 members. The Prophet Joseph replied and concluded his response by using the Standard of Truth as a preface to what we know today as the Thirteen Articles of Faith.
As I tour missions, many missionaries memorize the Standard of Truth. It conveys in a concise way what must be accomplished. As I recite it, I invite those of you who know it to say it with me:
No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.2
Who is going to help achieve this? You and your generation!
I believe with all of my heart that we are on the threshold of the most significant missionary success to date. Let me share two accounts of those who have been converted in the recent past.
The conversion of Jordan Vajda, a fine young man who had been a Catholic priest, is instructive. When he was in grade school he had Latter-day Saint friends in his class who shared with him their love of the gospel. At age 13 he found an offer from the Church for a free Book of Mormon. He sent for it, and two sister missionaries responded. They were surprised that he was only 13 and had requested the Book of Mormon. He was impressed with what they taught and what he felt, but after discussions with his family, he decided to become a priest in the Catholic Church. As he prepared to be a priest, he remained interested in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
He studied at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. He became acquainted with many who take the position we are not Christians, </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During the observance of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Church members have been reminded of the breadth and depth of his influence as the priesthood leader of this dispensation. Our knowledge has been renewed of the miracles associated with the coming forth and spreading of the gospel, the growth of the Church, and the continuing role of modern-day prophets who lead the Church in latter-day preparation to greet the Savior in a coming day as He ushers in the millennial era. We expect the Prophet Joseph to be with Him when He comes!
How do we prepare to meet the Savior? As we follow the Prophet, every faithful member of the Church must understand and accept a personal commitment to support the work of carrying the message of the restored gospel to the world. The life of each Church member will continue to be directly affected by missionary responsibility. We or our families will have been brought into the Church by missionaries, be now preparing for a mission, have already served at least one mission, or be supporting and sustaining others in fulfilling their calls. Knowledge about how the work is unfolding across the world will strengthen our faith and our desire to fulfill our personal missionary responsibilities.
I pray for the sustaining influence of the Holy Spirit as I offer thoughts about the Prophet Joseph and the coming forth of the Church on the African continent. The dedication of the Accra Ghana Temple in January of 2004 and of the Aba Nigeria Temple one month ago have been acknowledged by President Hinckley as truly miraculous in many ways, and these dedications constitute important parts of the fulfillment of the 1839 prophecy to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail, when he was told, “The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name” (D&amp;C 122:1).1
Africa remains substantially unknown to most of the world. Although it occupies nearly 20 percent of the earth’s surface and its population is almost 15 percent of the world’s total, there are still relatively few who have visited the continent or found reason to inform themselves about it.
For those who have been there, simply hearing the word Africa is exhilarating. It arouses an unending panorama of images and emotions for those who have visited the broad plains, the wondrous natural sights, the small villages, and the teeming cities or who have met any of the vast variety of heartwarming, disarmingly positive, and resourceful African people. A spiritual dimension is evidenced in the lives of so many of them, and they are warmly open and responsive to any sincere expression of friendship. It is primarily the African people who inspire such positive reactions and loyalties from foreign observers, but natural and physical Africa does as well.
Physically, Africa is vast, enormously complicated, and not easily described. It is a huge landmass of deserts, rain forests, boundless plains, wild animal</span>
