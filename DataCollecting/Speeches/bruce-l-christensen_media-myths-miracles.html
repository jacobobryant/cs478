  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am grateful for my wife, here on the stand with me, giving me her constant support. She really is my hero. I’m grateful for family members and friends who have shared with me the weight of saying something valuable to you during our time together.

I’m also thankful for colleagues from the College of Fine Arts and Communications, who also are seated on the stand and in the front rows of this assembly. I appreciate their support. They are a remarkably talented, intelligent, and disciplined group. It is a great privilege to be counted among their number.

A couple of weeks ago Dean Paul Cox and I were having lunch with a prospective student and his father. We were dining in the Museum of Art cafe when Dean Cox told this student that biology was the world’s oldest profession. Dean Cox explained that when the Lord put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to care for it, he created the world’s first biologists. He added that in doing so the Lord was also the first equal opportunity employer.

Since the student was interested in coming to BYU to study biology, I didn’t interrupt the good dean to let him know that other colleges have laid claim to having older professions than his.

The dean of the College of Nursing, Sandra Rogers, could argue that when the Lord took the rib from Adam with which to make Eve, he performed an operation; therefore, medicine is the oldest profession.

Dean Douglas Smoot might take exception with both of these propositions, arguing that the Lord’s creation of the heavens and the earth out of chaos was a magnificent engineering accomplishment, making his the oldest profession.

At this point, I get to put on my journalism hat and ask, “Who do you think created the chaos?”

It is about my profession, journalism (and the chaos so often attributed to it), that I would like to talk with you this morning. I want to connect my professional experiences with my religious beliefs, sharing what I’ve learned about both in my thirty years of working in the media.

My objectives are to

• define a context for you, by which to better understand the role of the press in a democratic society.

• identify some myths created by the media, promoted by the father of all lies.

• compare and contrast the values of the gospel with the media myths that we see daily.

• suggest the means by which we may use the miracles of technology to accomplish divine purposes.

What I will say in the next few minutes compresses complex professional issues into concepts that I hope can be easily understood. Some of my colleagues may find my approach simpleminded and perhaps stereo-typical, but nonetheless it represents a summary view of my experience in the media, and its incompleteness is fully acknowledged.

I am proud of my profession and of colleagues that serve our society with the highest possible standards of personal integrity. My intent this morning is to give both those inside the media and those who are faithful members of the Church a glimpse into each other’s worlds. I do so because I think each misunderstands—and therefore mistrusts—the other.

There are almost as many jokes about journalists as there are about lawyers. I share President Lee’s concern about that when he says, “I am deeply offended that the entire reputation of a noble and honored profession can be sullied by two or three hundred thousand bad apples.”

There are bad apples and excesses in every profession. Journalism may have more than its share (although I am not certain about that).

I perceive the biggest problem lies not in the bad apples but in an extraordinary clash between a journalist’s worldview and that of a faithful Church member.

The clash of worldviews that I refer to can be seen in the following examples:

• King Henry II’s question to his noblemen in reference to Thomas Beckett: “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?” The result was a clash of worldviews between state and church.

• Joseph Smith’s shutting down of the &lt;i&gt;Nauvoo Expositor, &lt;/i&gt;which ultimately led to his martyrdom, demonstrates a clash between theocracy and democracy.

• Accounts of wars, devastation, and human suffering triggered when one culture imposes its worldview on another or, more accurately, attempts to displace one worldview with another. We have plenty of current-day examples in these categories.

In his best-selling book &lt;i&gt;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, &lt;/i&gt;the author John Gray helps readers grapple with gender issues by talking about differences between the way men and women think and behave as if they came from Mars and Venus, respectively.

This literary device separates one’s personal investment in these differences, making it easier to recognize them when they are placed in the context of the way things are done on Mars or on Venus.

For our purposes this morning, if men are from Mars and women are from Venus, then journalists are from Pluto!

Pluto is a cold, dark, tiny, miserable place where everything is suspect. Where everybody lies. Where graft, corruption, malfeasance, self-interest, and greed reign supreme. And where the journalist’s job is to tell people about all of this garbage.

Some wag said that if journalists on Pluto had a Thirteenth Article of Faith, it would read, “If there is anything hateful, despicable, shameful, or rotten, we seek after these things.”

The Church’s worldview, on the other hand, comes from the planet Kolob. Most of the conflict and difficulty we have with the press comes from differences between our worldview, our frame of behavioral reference, and our cultural assumptions and those held by journalists.

The journalist’s worldview is democratic. In America, a journalist enjoys an explicit, constitutionally defined, and protected role written by the Founding Fathers.

When asked what form of government the Constitutional Convention had agreed upon, Benjamin Franklin replied, “A republic, the worst of all political systems, save all others.”

The Founding Fathers believed Lord Acton’s statement that “absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

The press plays a potent role in American democracy because it was intended to do so. It is one of the forces that the Founding Fathers balanced against the powers of government. The journalist’s duty is to tell about graft, corruption, greed, and malfeasance in our society.

Journalists are trained to be junkyard watch dogs. They bark at every opportunity, justified or not. It’s the best way that the Founding Fathers could find to keep us alert to what section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants explains in these words in verse 39:

&lt;i&gt;We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.&lt;/i&gt;

The Church’s worldview doesn’t flow from democratic principles (as much as we admire the Constitution for the freedoms it provides).

Our worldview comes from our belief that the best possible government is a theocracy: “a righteous King, making righteous judgments, ruling a righteous people who live righteous lives.” Such a society needs no watchdogs. In a theocracy the media will be used to disseminate pure knowledge, light, and truth! The entire society will seek that which is virtuous, lovely, or of good report.

Can you imagine how strange that world is to a journalist? Can you understand how difficult it is for these two worldviews to understand each other?

I often think about the necessary bridges to cross the chasm between my profession and my religion. How do we begin to understand each other and our very different views of the world?

Steven Covey in his book &lt;i&gt;Principle Centered Leadership &lt;/i&gt;says that we must first seek to understand if we would be understood.

What do we need to know when trying to understand what it is like to be from Pluto?

• Time has a different meaning on Pluto. Everything is immediate. It’s a planet full of deadlines. First and Fast are the gods worshipped there. Nothing is forever, and eternity cannot be considered. On Pluto the race is always to the swift and the battle to the strong.

An insider joke at CBS News is that if Moses handed down the Ten Commandments and it were reported on the evening news, the lead would be: “Moses came down from the mountain today with Ten Commandments written by the finger of God—the two most important of which were . . .” (Use your imaginations to fill in the blank.)

• On Pluto, provable facts are the means for determining what is relevant or valuable.

There is no place for “revealed” truth. Faith or belief cannot be admitted as legitimate means of inquiry.

• People who come from Pluto make different assumptions about authority and obedience. They have seen how authority and power corrupt. The concept of “righteous dominion” is incomprehensible to them.

In his autobiography entitled &lt;i&gt;Chronicles of Wasted Time, &lt;/i&gt;Malcolm Muggeridge wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Journalists follow authority as sharks do a liner, hoping to feed off the waste it discharges, with perhaps someone occasionally falling overboard to make a meal, and once in a way the whole ship going down and providing a positive feast.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Chronicles of Wasted Time, &lt;/i&gt;vol. 2, &lt;i&gt;The Infernal Grove &lt;/i&gt;(New York: William Morrow &amp;amp; Company, 1974), p. 39]

• Citizens of Pluto recognize self-worth as demonstrated by rugged individualism. The accumulation of wealth and power is based on the personal freedom to do as one pleases. Obligations to community are valid only when they promote individual rights and liberties.

This affects the way someone from Pluto approaches questions of motivation. Self-interest is seen as the driving force for all human behavior. Self-sacrifice is an unbelievable concept on Pluto.

“What’s in it for you?” is the primary question of relevance on Pluto.

The answer “Nothing” is unbelievable.

Explaining your motivation as obedience to what you believe are God’s commandments results in blank stares on Pluto. Its citizens cannot grasp the idea that there is peace of mind and joy in doing so.

Those who have visited Pluto and experience its culture come back shaking their heads and report that it’s a place where “No good deed goes unpunished!”

* On Pluto, there is no expiation or forgiveness for past sins. Repentance isn’t possible. Once a crook, always a crook—even if you were a president of the United States. Computer data files provide the ability to dredge up old copy with errors never corrected in the original text.

The picture that I’ve painted for journalists can be expanded, for purposes of this discussion, to the media in general. Here, however, instead of being from Pluto, media owners and producers come from the planet Midas.

They want everything they touch to turn to gold. The driving force in their culture is making money and lots of it.

All else is secondary. All else serves the prime directive: More!

On Midas, too much is never enough. On Midas, you can buy anything for money.

On Midas, media moguls make money by creating myths that businesses use to sell their goods and services. These myths have become tools of the father of all lies. These myths lead away from truth and light and toward the mist, darkness, and shadows that father Lehi saw in his dream.

They create the large and spacious building, and from that heap scorn and ridicule on those who would hold fast to the iron rod, and they do it by twisting our most basic needs into something carnal, sensual, and devilish.

Brother Richard Wirthlin, a world-renowned public opinion expert, recently reported his company’s findings from a survey that asked the American people to identify what they value most in their lives.

Take a moment and think about your heart’s desires. What do you desire most in your life and why?

The three top categories identified by Brother Wirthlin’s survey were these: first, self-esteem (a good opinion of one’s self and one’s actions); second, peace of mind; and third, joy or happiness in one’s daily life.

Self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy or happiness. These represent what the American people want most in their lives.

Contrast the striking difference between how the gospel of Jesus Christ fulfills these needs compared with the myths created by the media. The media would have us believe that self-esteem comes from owning things, looking and smelling good, or using the right products to make us sexually and socially attractive. The message is that self-esteem itself is a commodity that can be purchased.

The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that each of us is a child of a Heavenly Father and Mother, who love us and want us to return to their presence. As such, we have intrinsic self-worth. Our value to them is priceless.

We come from heaven, in the words of the poet, “trailing clouds of glory.”

The father of all lies wants us to believe otherwise. His purpose, in the words of Moses, is “to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will” (Moses 4:4).

Satan wants us to believe the myths created by the media. He wants us to forget about being children of heavenly parents and to believe that we can buy self-esteem by driving the right car, drinking the right soft drink, wearing the right clothes, putting on the right perfume, and eating the right food.

Media myths teach that things &lt;i&gt;external—&lt;/i&gt;and not &lt;i&gt;internal &lt;/i&gt;and certainly not &lt;i&gt;eternal—&lt;/i&gt;are all that matter. Peace of mind comes from “following one’s bliss.” These myths categorize religion as limiting, restricting, and suffocating one’s freedom of choice.

Media myths attribute guilt, personal anguish, and suffering to a belief in God. Absolutes are made relative, and there is no center from which peace of mind can flow.

How cunning and destructive are the myths that turn reality on its head!

The liberating, mind-expanding, soul-restoring blessings that come from obeying God’s will can never be experienced by humankind as long as they believe peace of mind requires no discipline or obedience.

God leads his children beside still waters and gives them the sweet peace of mind that only comes from knowing that one willingly and lovingly obeys his commandments.

Media myths make every individual responsible for achieving his or her own joy or happiness. Their messages focus on individual preeminence. These myths create and perpetuate the Me Generation. They create the idea that we must be constantly entertained, that anything that fails to immediately capture our attention is (according to my fifteen-year-old son, Jesse) b-o-r-i-n-g! These myths make self-gratification the ultimate source of joy or happiness.

How far from the truth they are!

The paradox of life is that service to others is the wellspring of joy and happiness. In all human interaction nothing is so rewarding or fulfilling as genuine service to someone other than oneself. It is a fundamental aspect of family life—fathers and mothers sacrificing for their children. It is an eternal pattern, learned from heavenly role models.

God has defined the context whereby we might have joy in this life, and joy will never be found in the self-indulgent, rapacious myths created for us in the media.

You can see how different the media myths are from the gospel’s message to our Father’s children. Our natural desire for self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy and happiness are being used by Satan to make us insecure, bitter, and miserable—just like him.

If all that I’ve said about the media this morning is true, and I believe that it is, you might reasonably ask why in the world would I continue to work in it?

When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act into law in 1967, he said that our society’s greatest challenge is to learn to “manage our miracles.”

This year the Church will have about 400,000 convert baptisms. That’s about how many people are born on the planet each day. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to calculate that we are falling behind in our efforts to reach all of God’s children, despite dramatic growth in Church membership.

How is the Church to meet the mandate in section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants that states: “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter” (D&amp;amp;C 90:11).

Elder M. Russell Ballard has said that the means of achieving this objective requires us to harness the miracles of the media to effectively communicate, in his words, “the greatest message ever revealed, which is that Jesus is the Christ, that we’re all sons and daughters of God, and that if we are faithful we will be able to return to him” (Minutes of Church Public Communications Advisory Committee, 19 August 1994).

Gordon Bowen, former chief creative officer of the advertising agency McCann Erickson Worldwide, told the faculty and students in our college last Thursday that we must be as effective as the devil in getting our message to Heavenly Father’s children.

Brother Bowen’s message echoes that of President Kimball’s given from this podium nearly twenty years ago, issuing the challenge for us to create the ways and the means to communicate the gospel in all of its glory.

Managing our miracles is up to us.

On a recent consulting assignment, one of our team members, Peter Schutz (former president and CEO of Porsche), in talking about our ability to sense the environment around us, said, “We’re not certain who first discovered water, but we’re pretty sure that it wasn’t the fish.”

Watching last week’s broadcast of the CLIO awards for outstanding television commercials, I was astounded when the presenter said that the average American viewer sees 250 such messages every day and that by the time an American child reaches age twenty-five, he or she will have seen more than two million television commercials.

We swim in a media environment, making us largely oblivious to its effects on our behavior.

The promises of the electronic super highway and interactive media leading to virtual-reality experiences for us and our children require the utmost attention.

The best things perverted become the worst.

Miracles of technology and the messages they convey can be what E. B. White called “A saving radiance in the sky,” or they can become the mind-numbing, values-distorting experiences desired by the adversary.

The owners and operators of our media miracles bear a particular burden for their use. One year ago last September, my wife and I were in Rome attending a worldwide conference of the heads of broadcasting networks.

Our group of about 150 media executives was invited to Castel Gandolfo, the Pope’s summer palace just outside of Rome along the Appian Way. We gathered in a small palace courtyard and listened to Pope John Paul’s admonition to use the media for better purposes than merely making money. These are his words:

&lt;i&gt;Precisely because the Church is deeply concerned for man and his needs, including those needs that remain unexpressed, she desires to direct the attention of those working in communications to ideals that are at once more lofty and more worthy of man. The Church appreciates the tremendous possibilities offered by the communications media, but she is not convinced that they have to be used as poorly as they sometimes are. For this reason she encourages all efforts to improve not only the technical and artistic quality of radio and television, but also and more importantly, its human quality.&lt;/i&gt;

Pope John Paul then went on to say:

&lt;i&gt;The Church appeals to the consciences of individuals employed in social communications and likewise to government leaders and all those to whom radio and television programs are directed. She asks them to make every effort to demand higher quality radio and television programs. Audiences should not be seen as simply the passive recipients of messages that all too often tend to manipulate and exploit.&lt;/i&gt;

What an extraordinary message, given to the world’s most influential and powerful broadcasters and given in terms that were unmistakably clear!

What a remarkable experience for me, because earlier that same September, Elder James E. Faust said almost the same thing in his BYU fireside address here in the Marriott Center. Elder Faust told us that we are responsible for our media choices and that we must take great care in making them.

Other General Authorities have counseled care in our selections of music, film, television and radio programs, and reading material. They see where the deep water is and give clear signals about its danger to us and our families.

Managing the media miracles in our lives is a daily challenge—one that can be made easier if we understand the role and nature of journalism in our democratic society; if we recognize the myths the media create that lead us away from self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy; and if we are willing take personal responsibility for how media is used in our homes and in our society.

In other words, to be effective in managing media miracles you must:

First, learn how the media functions in our society, understand its purposes and how it influences our lives. Blaming the media is not a solution. Understanding it is.

Second, commit yourself to effectively communicating the principles of the gospel through every means available to you. While your chosen profession may not be communications or the arts associated with creating messages to be delivered through the media, you are not powerless to control the media that you use or to influence its content.

And finally, prayerfully follow the counsel of the Brethren about the media and how it should be used.

I believe in a kind and loving Heavenly Father and Mother who want nothing but the best for me as one of their spiritual offspring. I sustain the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and acknowledge their importance in my life and in the intellectual and spiritual lives of all who attend this university.

It is my prayer that we will have the faith, the wisdom, and the will to build God’s kingdom, making us and our society one that would be welcome on the planet Kolob. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I am grateful for my wife, here on the stand with me, giving me her constant support. She really is my hero. I’m grateful for family members and friends who have shared with me the weight of saying something valuable to you during our time together.</p>
<p>I’m also thankful for colleagues from the College of Fine Arts and Communications, who also are seated on the stand and in the front rows of this assembly. I appreciate their support. They are a remarkably talented, intelligent, and disciplined group. It is a great privilege to be counted among their number.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago Dean Paul Cox and I were having lunch with a prospective student and his father. We were dining in the Museum of Art cafe when Dean Cox told this student that biology was the world’s oldest profession. Dean Cox explained that when the Lord put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to care for it, he created the world’s first biologists. He added that in doing so the Lord was also the first equal opportunity employer.</p>
<p>Since the student was interested in coming to BYU to study biology, I didn’t interrupt the good dean to let him know that other colleges have laid claim to having older professions than his.</p>
<p>The dean of the College of Nursing, Sandra Rogers, could argue that when the Lord took the rib from Adam with which to make Eve, he performed an operation; therefore, medicine is the oldest profession.</p>
<p>Dean Douglas Smoot might take exception with both of these propositions, arguing that the Lord’s creation of the heavens and the earth out of chaos was a magnificent engineering accomplishment, making his the oldest profession.</p>
<p>At this point, I get to put on my journalism hat and ask, “Who do you think created the chaos?”</p>
<p>It is about my profession, journalism (and the chaos so often attributed to it), that I would like to talk with you this morning. I want to connect my professional experiences with my religious beliefs, sharing what I’ve learned about both in my thirty years of working in the media.</p>
<p>My objectives are to</p>
<p>• define a context for you, by which to better understand the role of the press in a democratic society.</p>
<p>• identify some myths created by the media, promoted by the father of all lies.</p>
<p>• compare and contrast the values of the gospel with the media myths that we see daily.</p>
<p>• suggest the means by which we may use the miracles of technology to accomplish divine purposes.</p>
<p>What I will say in the next few minutes compresses complex professional issues into concepts that I hope can be easily understood. Some of my colleagues may find my approach simpleminded and perhaps stereo-typical, but nonetheless it represents a summary view of my experience in the media, and its incompleteness is fully acknowledged.</p>
<p>I am proud of my profession and of colleagues that serve our society with the highest possible standards of personal integrity. My intent this morning is to give both those inside the media and those who are faithful members of the Church a glimpse into each other’s worlds. I do so because I think each misunderstands—and therefore mistrusts—the other.</p>
<p>There are almost as many jokes about journalists as there are about lawyers. I share President Lee’s concern about that when he says, “I am deeply offended that the entire reputation of a noble and honored profession can be sullied by two or three hundred thousand bad apples.”</p>
<p>There are bad apples and excesses in every profession. Journalism may have more than its share (although I am not certain about that).</p>
<p>I perceive the biggest problem lies not in the bad apples but in an extraordinary clash between a journalist’s worldview and that of a faithful Church member.</p>
<p>The clash of worldviews that I refer to can be seen in the following examples:</p>
<p>• King Henry II’s question to his noblemen in reference to Thomas Beckett: “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?” The result was a clash of worldviews between state and church.</p>
<p>• Joseph Smith’s shutting down of the <i>Nauvoo Expositor, </i>which ultimately led to his martyrdom, demonstrates a clash between theocracy and democracy.</p>
<p>• Accounts of wars, devastation, and human suffering triggered when one culture imposes its worldview on another or, more accurately, attempts to displace one worldview with another. We have plenty of current-day examples in these categories.</p>
<p>In his best-selling book <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, </i>the author John Gray helps readers grapple with gender issues by talking about differences between the way men and women think and behave as if they came from Mars and Venus, respectively.</p>
<p>This literary device separates one’s personal investment in these differences, making it easier to recognize them when they are placed in the context of the way things are done on Mars or on Venus.</p>
<p>For our purposes this morning, if men are from Mars and women are from Venus, then journalists are from Pluto!</p>
<p>Pluto is a cold, dark, tiny, miserable place where everything is suspect. Where everybody lies. Where graft, corruption, malfeasance, self-interest, and greed reign supreme. And where the journalist’s job is to tell people about all of this garbage.</p>
<p>Some wag said that if journalists on Pluto had a Thirteenth Article of Faith, it would read, “If there is anything hateful, despicable, shameful, or rotten, we seek after these things.”</p>
<p>The Church’s worldview, on the other hand, comes from the planet Kolob. Most of the conflict and difficulty we have with the press comes from differences between our worldview, our frame of behavioral reference, and our cultural assumptions and those held by journalists.</p>
<p>The journalist’s worldview is democratic. In America, a journalist enjoys an explicit, constitutionally defined, and protected role written by the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>When asked what form of government the Constitutional Convention had agreed upon, Benjamin Franklin replied, “A republic, the worst of all political systems, save all others.”</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers believed Lord Acton’s statement that “absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</p>
<p>The press plays a potent role in American democracy because it was intended to do so. It is one of the forces that the Founding Fathers balanced against the powers of government. The journalist’s duty is to tell about graft, corruption, greed, and malfeasance in our society.</p>
<p>Journalists are trained to be junkyard watch dogs. They bark at every opportunity, justified or not. It’s the best way that the Founding Fathers could find to keep us alert to what section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants explains in these words in verse 39:</p>
<p><i>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i></p>
<p>The Church’s worldview doesn’t flow from democratic principles (as much as we admire the Constitution for the freedoms it provides).</p>
<p>Our worldview comes from our belief that the best possible government is a theocracy: “a righteous King, making righteous judgments, ruling a righteous people who live righteous lives.” Such a society needs no watchdogs. In a theocracy the media will be used to disseminate pure knowledge, light, and truth! The entire society will seek that which is virtuous, lovely, or of good report.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how strange that world is to a journalist? Can you understand how difficult it is for these two worldviews to understand each other?</p>
<p>I often think about the necessary bridges to cross the chasm between my profession and my religion. How do we begin to understand each other and our very different views of the world?</p>
<p>Steven Covey in his book <i>Principle Centered Leadership </i>says that we must first seek to understand if we would be understood.</p>
<p>What do we need to know when trying to understand what it is like to be from Pluto?</p>
<p>• Time has a different meaning on Pluto. Everything is immediate. It’s a planet full of deadlines. First and Fast are the gods worshipped there. Nothing is forever, and eternity cannot be considered. On Pluto the race is always to the swift and the battle to the strong.</p>
<p>An insider joke at CBS News is that if Moses handed down the Ten Commandments and it were reported on the evening news, the lead would be: “Moses came down from the mountain today with Ten Commandments written by the finger of God—the two most important of which were . . .” (Use your imaginations to fill in the blank.)</p>
<p>• On Pluto, provable facts are the means for determining what is relevant or valuable.</p>
<p>There is no place for “revealed” truth. Faith or belief cannot be admitted as legitimate means of inquiry.</p>
<p>• People who come from Pluto make different assumptions about authority and obedience. They have seen how authority and power corrupt. The concept of “righteous dominion” is incomprehensible to them.</p>
<p>In his autobiography entitled <i>Chronicles of Wasted Time, </i>Malcolm Muggeridge wrote:</p>
<p><i>Journalists follow authority as sharks do a liner, hoping to feed off the waste it discharges, with perhaps someone occasionally falling overboard to make a meal, and once in a way the whole ship going down and providing a positive feast.</i> [<i>Chronicles of Wasted Time, </i>vol. 2, <i>The Infernal Grove </i>(New York: William Morrow &amp; Company, 1974), p. 39]</p>
<p>• Citizens of Pluto recognize self-worth as demonstrated by rugged individualism. The accumulation of wealth and power is based on the personal freedom to do as one pleases. Obligations to community are valid only when they promote individual rights and liberties.</p>
<p>This affects the way someone from Pluto approaches questions of motivation. Self-interest is seen as the driving force for all human behavior. Self-sacrifice is an unbelievable concept on Pluto.</p>
<p>“What’s in it for you?” is the primary question of relevance on Pluto.</p>
<p>The answer “Nothing” is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Explaining your motivation as obedience to what you believe are God’s commandments results in blank stares on Pluto. Its citizens cannot grasp the idea that there is peace of mind and joy in doing so.</p>
<p>Those who have visited Pluto and experience its culture come back shaking their heads and report that it’s a place where “No good deed goes unpunished!”</p>
<p>* On Pluto, there is no expiation or forgiveness for past sins. Repentance isn’t possible. Once a crook, always a crook—even if you were a president of the United States. Computer data files provide the ability to dredge up old copy with errors never corrected in the original text.</p>
<p>The picture that I’ve painted for journalists can be expanded, for purposes of this discussion, to the media in general. Here, however, instead of being from Pluto, media owners and producers come from the planet Midas.</p>
<p>They want everything they touch to turn to gold. The driving force in their culture is making money and lots of it.</p>
<p>All else is secondary. All else serves the prime directive: More!</p>
<p>On Midas, too much is never enough. On Midas, you can buy anything for money.</p>
<p>On Midas, media moguls make money by creating myths that businesses use to sell their goods and services. These myths have become tools of the father of all lies. These myths lead away from truth and light and toward the mist, darkness, and shadows that father Lehi saw in his dream.</p>
<p>They create the large and spacious building, and from that heap scorn and ridicule on those who would hold fast to the iron rod, and they do it by twisting our most basic needs into something carnal, sensual, and devilish.</p>
<p>Brother Richard Wirthlin, a world-renowned public opinion expert, recently reported his company’s findings from a survey that asked the American people to identify what they value most in their lives.</p>
<p>Take a moment and think about your heart’s desires. What do you desire most in your life and why?</p>
<p>The three top categories identified by Brother Wirthlin’s survey were these: first, self-esteem (a good opinion of one’s self and one’s actions); second, peace of mind; and third, joy or happiness in one’s daily life.</p>
<p>Self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy or happiness. These represent what the American people want most in their lives.</p>
<p>Contrast the striking difference between how the gospel of Jesus Christ fulfills these needs compared with the myths created by the media. The media would have us believe that self-esteem comes from owning things, looking and smelling good, or using the right products to make us sexually and socially attractive. The message is that self-esteem itself is a commodity that can be purchased.</p>
<p>The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that each of us is a child of a Heavenly Father and Mother, who love us and want us to return to their presence. As such, we have intrinsic self-worth. Our value to them is priceless.</p>
<p>We come from heaven, in the words of the poet, “trailing clouds of glory.”</p>
<p>The father of all lies wants us to believe otherwise. His purpose, in the words of Moses, is “to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will” (Moses 4:4).</p>
<p>Satan wants us to believe the myths created by the media. He wants us to forget about being children of heavenly parents and to believe that we can buy self-esteem by driving the right car, drinking the right soft drink, wearing the right clothes, putting on the right perfume, and eating the right food.</p>
<p>Media myths teach that things <i>external—</i>and not <i>internal </i>and certainly not <i>eternal—</i>are all that matter. Peace of mind comes from “following one’s bliss.” These myths categorize religion as limiting, restricting, and suffocating one’s freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Media myths attribute guilt, personal anguish, and suffering to a belief in God. Absolutes are made relative, and there is no center from which peace of mind can flow.</p>
<p>How cunning and destructive are the myths that turn reality on its head!</p>
<p>The liberating, mind-expanding, soul-restoring blessings that come from obeying God’s will can never be experienced by humankind as long as they believe peace of mind requires no discipline or obedience.</p>
<p>God leads his children beside still waters and gives them the sweet peace of mind that only comes from knowing that one willingly and lovingly obeys his commandments.</p>
<p>Media myths make every individual responsible for achieving his or her own joy or happiness. Their messages focus on individual preeminence. These myths create and perpetuate the Me Generation. They create the idea that we must be constantly entertained, that anything that fails to immediately capture our attention is (according to my fifteen-year-old son, Jesse) b-o-r-i-n-g! These myths make self-gratification the ultimate source of joy or happiness.</p>
<p>How far from the truth they are!</p>
<p>The paradox of life is that service to others is the wellspring of joy and happiness. In all human interaction nothing is so rewarding or fulfilling as genuine service to someone other than oneself. It is a fundamental aspect of family life—fathers and mothers sacrificing for their children. It is an eternal pattern, learned from heavenly role models.</p>
<p>God has defined the context whereby we might have joy in this life, and joy will never be found in the self-indulgent, rapacious myths created for us in the media.</p>
<p>You can see how different the media myths are from the gospel’s message to our Father’s children. Our natural desire for self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy and happiness are being used by Satan to make us insecure, bitter, and miserable—just like him.</p>
<p>If all that I’ve said about the media this morning is true, and I believe that it is, you might reasonably ask why in the world would I continue to work in it?</p>
<p>When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act into law in 1967, he said that our society’s greatest challenge is to learn to “manage our miracles.”</p>
<p>This year the Church will have about 400,000 convert baptisms. That’s about how many people are born on the planet each day. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to calculate that we are falling behind in our efforts to reach all of God’s children, despite dramatic growth in Church membership.</p>
<p>How is the Church to meet the mandate in section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants that states: “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter” (D&amp;C 90:11).</p>
<p>Elder M. Russell Ballard has said that the means of achieving this objective requires us to harness the miracles of the media to effectively communicate, in his words, “the greatest message ever revealed, which is that Jesus is the Christ, that we’re all sons and daughters of God, and that if we are faithful we will be able to return to him” (Minutes of Church Public Communications Advisory Committee, 19 August 1994).</p>
<p>Gordon Bowen, former chief creative officer of the advertising agency McCann Erickson Worldwide, told the faculty and students in our college last Thursday that we must be as effective as the devil in getting our message to Heavenly Father’s children.</p>
<p>Brother Bowen’s message echoes that of President Kimball’s given from this podium nearly twenty years ago, issuing the challenge for us to create the ways and the means to communicate the gospel in all of its glory.</p>
<p>Managing our miracles is up to us.</p>
<p>On a recent consulting assignment, one of our team members, Peter Schutz (former president and CEO of Porsche), in talking about our ability to sense the environment around us, said, “We’re not certain who first discovered water, but we’re pretty sure that it wasn’t the fish.”</p>
<p>Watching last week’s broadcast of the CLIO awards for outstanding television commercials, I was astounded when the presenter said that the average American viewer sees 250 such messages every day and that by the time an American child reaches age twenty-five, he or she will have seen more than two million television commercials.</p>
<p>We swim in a media environment, making us largely oblivious to its effects on our behavior.</p>
<p>The promises of the electronic super highway and interactive media leading to virtual-reality experiences for us and our children require the utmost attention.</p>
<p>The best things perverted become the worst.</p>
<p>Miracles of technology and the messages they convey can be what E. B. White called “A saving radiance in the sky,” or they can become the mind-numbing, values-distorting experiences desired by the adversary.</p>
<p>The owners and operators of our media miracles bear a particular burden for their use. One year ago last September, my wife and I were in Rome attending a worldwide conference of the heads of broadcasting networks.</p>
<p>Our group of about 150 media executives was invited to Castel Gandolfo, the Pope’s summer palace just outside of Rome along the Appian Way. We gathered in a small palace courtyard and listened to Pope John Paul’s admonition to use the media for better purposes than merely making money. These are his words:</p>
<p><i>Precisely because the Church is deeply concerned for man and his needs, including those needs that remain unexpressed, she desires to direct the attention of those working in communications to ideals that are at once more lofty and more worthy of man. The Church appreciates the tremendous possibilities offered by the communications media, but she is not convinced that they have to be used as poorly as they sometimes are. For this reason she encourages all efforts to improve not only the technical and artistic quality of radio and television, but also and more importantly, its human quality.</i></p>
<p>Pope John Paul then went on to say:</p>
<p><i>The Church appeals to the consciences of individuals employed in social communications and likewise to government leaders and all those to whom radio and television programs are directed. She asks them to make every effort to demand higher quality radio and television programs. Audiences should not be seen as simply the passive recipients of messages that all too often tend to manipulate and exploit.</i></p>
<p>What an extraordinary message, given to the world’s most influential and powerful broadcasters and given in terms that were unmistakably clear!</p>
<p>What a remarkable experience for me, because earlier that same September, Elder James E. Faust said almost the same thing in his BYU fireside address here in the Marriott Center. Elder Faust told us that we are responsible for our media choices and that we must take great care in making them.</p>
<p>Other General Authorities have counseled care in our selections of music, film, television and radio programs, and reading material. They see where the deep water is and give clear signals about its danger to us and our families.</p>
<p>Managing the media miracles in our lives is a daily challenge—one that can be made easier if we understand the role and nature of journalism in our democratic society; if we recognize the myths the media create that lead us away from self-esteem, peace of mind, and joy; and if we are willing take personal responsibility for how media is used in our homes and in our society.</p>
<p>In other words, to be effective in managing media miracles you must:</p>
<p>First, learn how the media functions in our society, understand its purposes and how it influences our lives. Blaming the media is not a solution. Understanding it is.</p>
<p>Second, commit yourself to effectively communicating the principles of the gospel through every means available to you. While your chosen profession may not be communications or the arts associated with creating messages to be delivered through the media, you are not powerless to control the media that you use or to influence its content.</p>
<p>And finally, prayerfully follow the counsel of the Brethren about the media and how it should be used.</p>
<p>I believe in a kind and loving Heavenly Father and Mother who want nothing but the best for me as one of their spiritual offspring. I sustain the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and acknowledge their importance in my life and in the intellectual and spiritual lives of all who attend this university.</p>
<p>It is my prayer that we will have the faith, the wisdom, and the will to build God’s kingdom, making us and our society one that would be welcome on the planet Kolob. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I was ten or eleven years old, my twin brother and I went on a hike up the mountain just north of Y Mountain. Together, with a few friends, we woke up early and climbed straight up the face and then scampered across the top to the peak overlooking Rock Canyon.
On our way back down we ran into a small rattlesnake. Being the excitable kids we were, we surrounded the poor creature and wouldn’t let it escape. We became so bold as to pick it up by the tail as it would try to slither away. We’d hold it for a second or two and then drop it when our nerves gave in. The potentially deadly consequence of our actions didn’t deter us from our foolishness.
When we got home, my mother asked me if everything went okay on the hike. I mumbled something about a rattlesnake. She then related to me that at about the same time we would have been fooling around with the snake, she had received a strong impression that we were in danger. She had knelt and prayed for us. I was astonished. How did she know we were in trouble? This is my earliest recollection of what has become many experiences in which my mother received specific inspiration from the Holy Ghost in the very moment she needed it. At the time it seemed mysterious to me—this idea of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. I wondered how it really worked. I understood that the Holy Ghost was a personage of spirit, but I puzzled over how He could be helping everyone at once.
Years later, during my freshman year at BYU, I found myself sitting in a Physics 122 class. One day we were discussing the theoretical limit of the speed of light—about 300,000,000 meters per second. For the non-physics majors, that’s more than 670 million miles per hour.
The professor said, “It is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel.” Then he paused and said, “But we know of something faster—the speed of prayer.” He reasoned that if God has a body as tangible as man’s, then He occupies a discreet place in the universe. And we believe we can instantaneously communicate with Him. So there must be something faster than the speed of light.
Again I found myself reflecting upon the nature of the power of the Holy Ghost. Keep in mind that this was in 1985, so there was no Internet and there were no smartphones or wireless networks that convey data all over the world to millions of people simultaneously in a matter of seconds. Today, with our current experience, it doesn’t even stretch our minds to imagine technology that is capable of sending instantaneous and personalized messages to millions—even billions—of people at the same time.

Today I’d like to discuss just a few of the things I have learned since my youth about the power of the Holy Ghost and the nature of truth. Obviously this won’t be a complete treatise on the Holy Ghost but a personal reflection. I humbly add my t</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">To say that I am flattered to be standing at this podium would be a gross understatement. I consider this to be an honor of the highest order because of who you are and the enormous impact that this place has had on my life.
My relationship to this campus goes far beyond my current titles or even my degrees from this institution. The only word that is intimate enough yet broad enough to encompass my connection to BYU is the word home. BYU is my home. I have lived within walking distance of this very spot more than I have lived anywhere else in the world. I am a child of BYU, not just because I received an undergraduate degree from here but because I was literally a child here—living with my parents and the rest of my family in Heritage Halls during summer pilgrimages to this campus when my father was completing his PhD.
I have learned on this campus, I have grown on this campus, and I have discovered great things about myself and about you on this campus. Much of my research is dedicated to observations of your generation, and, I have to admit, you have much to be proud of. A recent column in the New York Times Magazine noted that young people today are more averse to risky behavior than their parents were at the same age. Drug and alcohol use, smoking, and sexual activity have all been in sharp decline in your demographic during the past twenty years.1 Also, financial firm TD Ameritrade believes you are more financially savvy and better savers than your parents,2 and a study conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine suggests that your willingness to improve society at large may actually improve your eating habits.3 If these are the inclinations of our culture at large, I certainly believe that these trends would only be amplified among the student body of BYU.
All of this might come as a bit of a shock to your parents, who have spent so much time and effort getting you to eat your vegetables and shielding you from evil—but it does not come as a shock to me. I watch you; I see you doing good. I am acutely aware of my responsibility to add to and not detract from the spirit that you carry.
While you certainly deserve praise and recognition, you should also recognize that your generation has its own unique characteristics and challenges. For example, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to capture and maintain your attention. I know that many of you are multitasking at this very moment—doing homework, checking your Facebook account, answering emails, texting your friends about your lunch plans, or even shopping. All of these things are available to you here in the Marriott Center through the devices that we carry in our pockets; these tools and technologies are increasingly becoming vital parts of our work, our play, our families, and our very identities.
I’m addicted, too. If you would have told me at age thirty (just a little w</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Happy Valentine’s Day! This is a day when we celebrate love. We think of love letters and hearts, roses and chocolate. Many hope today to receive a message from one they love, and some are planning to deliver a message to one they love. I hope you won’t be disappointed.
My parents loved me dearly—of that I had no doubt. But when I was ten years old, I had to attend boarding school in England while my parents continued to live thousands of miles away in Saudi Arabia. The separation was an enormous wrench for me.
On the long flight to England, I remember feeling queasy in the pit of my stomach as I left behind the heat and sunshine of Arabia, flew across the miles, and descended through multiple layers of cloud into the cold, gray scene of London’s Heathrow Airport. The rain droplets on the airplane window shot past, and I felt so very, very far from home.
I arrived at the school in my uniform of gray shorts, sweater, tie, and cap, pulling my great, green trunk of belongings behind me. The loneliness was overwhelming.
I slept in a dormitory with about fifteen other boys. It was a very foreign experience, complete with rickety, metal-framed beds and the occasional pillow fight. Every morning after making our beds, we boys would stand aside while our bed-making skills and “hospital corners” were graded. There were unfamiliar smells, unfamiliar foods, and very unfamiliar teachers. My Latin master would walk around the room and peck our heads with the tip of his ballpoint pen if we didn’t know an answer. And I was very well pecked.
Out on the fields during our sports time, on a rare clear day, if a plane was flying high overhead, leaving a vapor trail, I would study its course to see if that plane might be heading back to Arabia—feeling a deep pang if it was. I longed, somehow, to jump aboard and go back home to my parents.
The brightest spot in any week came during breakfast time when mail was delivered. I would look anxiously for the telltale blue airmail letter that my mother sent faithfully every week. As the teachers came around the tables with letters to hand out, I would literally be on the edge of my bench waiting to see if one was for me. In so many senses this was Hogwarts, but without the owls and with none of the magic.
The blue airmail letters were often the highlight of my week, particularly in those early days when my loneliness was most acute. I would receive letters from home with such happiness and relief. I would wait until I could be alone to carefully unseal them and then eagerly read the messages of love, reassurance, and advice from my parents. I savored every line and felt, for those moments, closer to home and closer to my parents’ love, and I received the courage I needed to continue on for another week.
There is much in the natural course of mortal life that can make us feel alone and afraid, even while we are surrounded </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When Mary Magdalene and “the other Mary” arrived at the empty tomb, they were greeted by an angel of the Lord who told them to “go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead.”1 Matthew, in chapter 28, goes on to state, “They departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.”2
Within a short period of time, we presume (remember, they were running), the message had been delivered, and the 11 disciples were again reunited with their Lord and Master. It was then that the Savior of the world gave His first postresurrection commandment to his disciples. He told them:
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.3
He didn’t tell them to visit with their neighbors or to try to tract out their communities; rather, he told them to go and “teach all nations.” I wonder if those 11 disciples or the other followers of Christ at the time stopped and asked either verbally or at least in their own minds and hearts, “So, how are we going to do this? We have these little fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee, and we don’t mind walking a distance or maybe riding a donkey or a camel to a neighboring village, but, really, we’re supposed to ‘teach all nations’?”
Now let’s fast-forward about 1,800 years. Tomorrow, April 6, marks a special anniversary for Latter-day Saints, as it was on that day that the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered with a small group in a farmhouse in western New York and organized the Church of Jesus Christ. Imagine how those six charter Church members must have felt when Joseph told them, “And, by the way, we’re going to take this gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world.” If they stopped to consider what he was saying, can you imagine how overwhelming and perhaps even unrealistic that charge must have felt to them and perhaps even to Joseph himself?
The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants states that “the voice of warning shall be unto all people”—not just to the followers of Joseph Smith, not just to the small gathering of Saints assembled at that special conference in 1831 where this particular revelation was given, but to “all people.”4
In the first and second verses at the beginning of the Doctrine and Covenants—verses that have become meaningful for me and my colleagues at BYU Broadcasting—the Lord stated:
Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.
For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.5</span>
