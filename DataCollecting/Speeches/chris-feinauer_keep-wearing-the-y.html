  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. I am especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy my family experiences through having children attend BYU.

Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:

&lt;i&gt;I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually.&lt;/i&gt; [“Your Gifts Bless Generations,” insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]

I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I trust you feel that as well.

Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed many tests—some academic and some in other important areas of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.

It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when

&lt;i&gt;Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. “It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, ‘What have I done?’ and, ‘What do I do now?’” he recalls. “I found myself on my knees within minutes.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD ’78). Edwards set a chair directly in front of Mendenhall’s chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.&lt;/i&gt;

“[LaVell Edward’s] &lt;i&gt;first words were ‘You have a tough job.’ Then there was a pause and silence,” says Mendenhall. “It wasn’t very comforting to hear that. But then&lt;/i&gt; [LaVell] &lt;i&gt;just said, ‘But it’s a great job.’ I didn’t know what he meant by either at the time.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Mendenhall has come to consider&lt;/i&gt; [Coach] &lt;i&gt;Edwards a mentor and an advocate. “It’s nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what it’s like to be a head coach here.” The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be.&lt;/i&gt; [Peter B. Gardner, “The Bronco Way,” &lt;i&gt;BYU Magazine,&lt;/i&gt; winter 2007, 22–23]

Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, contact your colleges and offer to mentor students. For those who will be farther away, stay close to students when they are home for vacations or to work between semesters. Just an arm on a shoulder, some encouragement and advice, and showing that someone cares about their success is a terrific way to take BYU with you. Be mentors.

I have a BYU ring that I always wear. I was on vacation in Southern California last fall, and it was amazing how many people saw it and told me they were BYU alums or supporters. It was a small thing—only visible if someone saw my hand—yet it generated a lot of discussion and inquiry everywhere I went. That one small ring had a huge effect on connecting people to BYU and to each other. You can have just as much impact and be significant in connecting people for good—just like my ring was to those people I encountered while on vacation—if you “wear the Y” wherever you are.

Wear the Y

in your countenance

in your speech and communication

in your example

in your choices

in your attitude

You will find that “wearing BYU” will allow you to share the gospel and stay connected for good to the university.

Here are three more ideas to consider: contribute, connect, and serve.

First, contribute annually with your monetary resources. One thing I have learned in my service to the BYU Alumni Association is that every gift to BYU—large or small—is important to the university.

Erlynn Lansing, a grateful alum who graduated in 1974, said this:

&lt;i&gt;Our experience [at BYU] and our associations at the university have helped us as parents, in our Church callings, and in [my husband’s] professional duties. . . . The only way we can adequately thank the Lord and all those who have helped us is to give back so that others may have wonderful experiences like we’ve had.&lt;/i&gt; [Erlynn Ensign Lansing, “Funding Futures,” &lt;i&gt;BYU Magazine,&lt;/i&gt; summer 2010, 58]

Robbie Ross Tisch, a strategic planning and organizational effectiveness consultant, shared these thoughts on giving:

&lt;i&gt;Being generous takes people out of narrow, fearful places of scarcity and returns them to the spaciousness of connection and concern about others, into “we-ness” rather than “me-ness.”&lt;/i&gt;[http://www.managementassistance.org/ht/a/GetDocumentAction/i/11015]

Because of donations, thousand of students receive an outstanding education. Show your appreciation by supporting the financial needs of BYU. Your monetary resources are vital to the work of the university.

Next, stay connected to BYU by attending BYU-related events, allowing you to enjoy the fruits of what BYU students and alumni have to offer in the way of excellence in sports, performance, and intellectual knowledge. And update your records so we can keep you informed about BYU. Let us know where you are, because we want you to be “connected for good” to the university and to alumni everywhere you go.

And, finally, serve and volunteer.

Linda Palmer, executive director of the Alumni Association, said:

&lt;i&gt;Service is a core part of being a BYU graduate. It’s our charge. We enter to learn; we must go forth to serve. Bettering the world is part of the commitment we make in coming here.&lt;/i&gt; [Linda Palmer, “Enter to Serve,” &lt;i&gt;BYU Magazine,&lt;/i&gt; fall 2010, 49]

BYU is here to help all of us serve the world better. Look for opportunities in your life to be the one who makes the difference in the life of another. Bring light and goodness wherever you are through your service.

Mentoring, wearing the Y, contributing, and serving—these will keep the Spirit of the Y alive in you.

As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.

You have gained a rich heritage from your experiences as a student and member of the BYU community. You can bless others with your heritage wherever you are. Be a light to those who can be lifted, taught, and encouraged. Be proud of what BYU is, for it is much more than you might have seen in your time here. It is a wonderful combination of many colleges, teams, performing groups, clubs, academic associations, and religious affiliations that all combine to meet the needs of the world we live in. That world is begging for bright, wholesome, dedicated graduates to take all the goodness BYU has produced in you to serve the world with your talents and abilities.

May you maintain a meaningful connection to the people, relationships, feelings, experiences, and memories created at BYU. May your Christlike influence be felt wherever you may be found throughout the world, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

&lt;i&gt;Chris Feinauer was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 11 August 2011.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. I am especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy my family experiences through having children attend BYU.</p>
<p>Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:</p>
<p><i>I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually.</i> [“Your Gifts Bless Generations,” insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]</p>
<p>I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I trust you feel that as well.</p>
<p>Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed many tests—some academic and some in other important areas of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.</p>
<p>It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when</p>
<p><i>Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. “It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, ‘What have I done?’ and, ‘What do I do now?’” he recalls. “I found myself on my knees within minutes.”</i></p>
<p><i>Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD ’78). Edwards set a chair directly in front of Mendenhall’s chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.</i></p>
<p>“[LaVell Edward’s] <i>first words were ‘You have a tough job.’ Then there was a pause and silence,” says Mendenhall. “It wasn’t very comforting to hear that. But then</i> [LaVell] <i>just said, ‘But it’s a great job.’ I didn’t know what he meant by either at the time.”</i></p>
<p><i>Mendenhall has come to consider</i> [Coach] <i>Edwards a mentor and an advocate. “It’s nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what it’s like to be a head coach here.” The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be.</i> [Peter B. Gardner, “The Bronco Way,” <i>BYU Magazine,</i> winter 2007, 22–23]</p>
<p>Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, contact your colleges and offer to mentor students. For those who will be farther away, stay close to students when they are home for vacations or to work between semesters. Just an arm on a shoulder, some encouragement and advice, and showing that someone cares about their success is a terrific way to take BYU with you. Be mentors.</p>
<p>I have a BYU ring that I always wear. I was on vacation in Southern California last fall, and it was amazing how many people saw it and told me they were BYU alums or supporters. It was a small thing—only visible if someone saw my hand—yet it generated a lot of discussion and inquiry everywhere I went. That one small ring had a huge effect on connecting people to BYU and to each other. You can have just as much impact and be significant in connecting people for good—just like my ring was to those people I encountered while on vacation—if you “wear the Y” wherever you are.</p>
<p>Wear the Y</p>
<p>in your countenance</p>
<p>in your speech and communication</p>
<p>in your example</p>
<p>in your choices</p>
<p>in your attitude</p>
<p>You will find that “wearing BYU” will allow you to share the gospel and stay connected for good to the university.</p>
<p>Here are three more ideas to consider: contribute, connect, and serve.</p>
<p>First, contribute annually with your monetary resources. One thing I have learned in my service to the BYU Alumni Association is that every gift to BYU—large or small—is important to the university.</p>
<p>Erlynn Lansing, a grateful alum who graduated in 1974, said this:</p>
<p><i>Our experience [at BYU] and our associations at the university have helped us as parents, in our Church callings, and in [my husband’s] professional duties. . . . The only way we can adequately thank the Lord and all those who have helped us is to give back so that others may have wonderful experiences like we’ve had.</i> [Erlynn Ensign Lansing, “Funding Futures,” <i>BYU Magazine,</i> summer 2010, 58]</p>
<p>Robbie Ross Tisch, a strategic planning and organizational effectiveness consultant, shared these thoughts on giving:</p>
<p><i>Being generous takes people out of narrow, fearful places of scarcity and returns them to the spaciousness of connection and concern about others, into “we-ness” rather than “me-ness.”</i>[http://www.managementassistance.org/ht/a/GetDocumentAction/i/11015]</p>
<p>Because of donations, thousand of students receive an outstanding education. Show your appreciation by supporting the financial needs of BYU. Your monetary resources are vital to the work of the university.</p>
<p>Next, stay connected to BYU by attending BYU-related events, allowing you to enjoy the fruits of what BYU students and alumni have to offer in the way of excellence in sports, performance, and intellectual knowledge. And update your records so we can keep you informed about BYU. Let us know where you are, because we want you to be “connected for good” to the university and to alumni everywhere you go.</p>
<p>And, finally, serve and volunteer.</p>
<p>Linda Palmer, executive director of the Alumni Association, said:</p>
<p><i>Service is a core part of being a BYU graduate. It’s our charge. We enter to learn; we must go forth to serve. Bettering the world is part of the commitment we make in coming here.</i> [Linda Palmer, “Enter to Serve,” <i>BYU Magazine,</i> fall 2010, 49]</p>
<p>BYU is here to help all of us serve the world better. Look for opportunities in your life to be the one who makes the difference in the life of another. Bring light and goodness wherever you are through your service.</p>
<p>Mentoring, wearing the Y, contributing, and serving—these will keep the Spirit of the Y alive in you.</p>
<p>As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.</p>
<p>You have gained a rich heritage from your experiences as a student and member of the BYU community. You can bless others with your heritage wherever you are. Be a light to those who can be lifted, taught, and encouraged. Be proud of what BYU is, for it is much more than you might have seen in your time here. It is a wonderful combination of many colleges, teams, performing groups, clubs, academic associations, and religious affiliations that all combine to meet the needs of the world we live in. That world is begging for bright, wholesome, dedicated graduates to take all the goodness BYU has produced in you to serve the world with your talents and abilities.</p>
<p>May you maintain a meaningful connection to the people, relationships, feelings, experiences, and memories created at BYU. May your Christlike influence be felt wherever you may be found throughout the world, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:
I want you to remember that you ought not to tea</span>

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
