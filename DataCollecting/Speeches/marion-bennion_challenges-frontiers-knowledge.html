  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you very much, and thank you, President Oaks. This is really my first opportunity to view this audience from this particular perspective, and as you can probably imagine, it is indeed overwhelming. But I do want to express, both for myself and I am sure for all of the other recipients of the Karl G. Maeser Awards today, our appreciation to the Alumni Association and to the University. We feel that this is an honor to be invited to join such distinguished company as the past recipients of these awards, and we do thank you. Since teachers wouldn’t be teachers without students, I would also like to take this opportunity today to express my own appreciation to my students and to tell them how much they mean to me and how special they are. I see them scattered over the audience.

At an assembly recognizing achievement in research and teaching within a university, it seems appropriate to talk about challenges on the frontiers of knowledge. A true university is on the frontiers of knowledge. It is a community of scholars dedicated to expanding the bounds of knowledge in all disciplines. The university offers both faculty and students a challenge, not only to learn what others have discovered, but also to feel that joy of discovering for themselves something really new after long and diligent research. Challenges create excitement, and the university world can be a very exciting place—for the fresh young undergraduate completing his first independent study project, for the young faculty member with a new Ph.D. just beginning to test his research abilities on his own, for the seasoned researcher with many publications to his credit and with the earned respect of his colleagues, and for everyone in between.

Dr. DeBakey, the noted heart surgeon, pointed out a few weeks ago when he visited this campus that every one of us has an important obligation to at least support scientific research that will be used to improve the quality of life for all mankind. Dr. DeBakey, of course, vividly demonstrated this point by showing films of lifesaving open-heart surgery that had been made possible through the efforts of hundreds of researchers working in laboratories throughout the world.

There are new challenges on the frontiers of knowledge in every academic discipline of the university. Many of the unsolved problems that present challenges overlap several disciplines, and interdisciplinary approaches to their solution are essential. We do need to work together in this community of scholars that is a university. Cooperation among disciplines and understanding of each other’s abilities and contributions will help greatly to further the knowledge explosion and the application of new knowledge to the problems of living.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Food and Nutrition an Applied Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Today I would like to take my own academic area, which is nutrition and food science, to illustrate just a few of the unsolved problems that are today creating challenges. As I talk about some of the unanswered questions in nutrition, equally challenging problems in each of your own academic areas should come to mind. The problems may be different, but the challenges of discovery should have a common thread.

My chosen field of study is one that might be classified as an applied science. Consequently, it draws on many other areas for basic scientific principles to be applied to the practical problems dealing with food and nutrition. It draws on chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, medicine, sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, agriculture, and engineering—all important to food and nutrition. It is in itself interdisciplinary, at least in a sense. The area of nutrition and food science is also one that is somewhat unique because it actually involves a personal experience for everyone who lives. Whether you eat to live or live to eat, you are still involved with food. Everyone eats, or he doesn’t live very long. Thus, everyone is something of an expert on foods, at least where his own food habits are concerned. This situation creates both advantages and disadvantages for the educator and the researcher in nutrition and food science. It is an advantage in that he has a really tremendous audience interested in his subject, but it is sometimes a disadvantage in that he has to compete with so many self-styled authorities, to whom subjective personal experience is sometimes more important than documented research data.

Yes, the problems in nutrition and food science are many. It is a relatively new science, only about sixty years old. Although it is a rapidly expanding field, the expansion often seems to do little more than open up new areas of the unknown. And I think that this is common to most disciplines—a sometimes overwhelming recognition of the tremendous store of knowledge and application yet to be discovered.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social Implications of Food&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Let’s begin with some social science implications for food and nutrition. We might say that food is more than nutrition. Man as a biological being does require food to sustain life. He eats to satisfy his hunger and to meet his basic drive for food. But man is also a social being, and food is intimately woven into the social, psychological, and intellectual lives of men. Men have learned to live and work together and have organized themselves into societies. As human infants grow and develop, they are incorporated into one of these societies through varied experiences, and many of these experiences involve food. The term &lt;i&gt;culture&lt;/i&gt;may be used to describe a way of life in which there are common customs or rules for behavior and in which there is a common understanding among members of the group. Food is filled with many different meanings and much symbolism for all individuals at various ages and stages of their maturity. Food is part of the fabric of life, and this fact must be recognized by anyone who seeks to change or to modify the food patterns of individuals and groups.

An anthropologist, Dorothy Lee, has written about food and human existence:

&lt;i&gt;When I speak of FOOD AND HUMAN EXISTENCE, I am not trying to use a special synonym for the phrase “nutrition and life.” I mean something beyond mere biochemical nutrition and more than mere physical survival. Food can engage me completely as a person. It can bring to life my keen anticipation, my impatient or happy waiting; it can evoke my memory in all its pain and joy; it can pierce me with nostalgia; it can revolt me to the point of vomiting. Its preparation can be an act of relatedness, of obligation, of self-fulfillment, of creativity, of love; its eating can be participation and communion. Let us hope it also nourishes me physically, supplying me with the proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, and other nutrients I need to stay alive and healthy so that I can experience the fullness of human existence.&lt;/i&gt; [“Food and Human Existence,” National Dairy Council &lt;i&gt;Nutrition News&lt;/i&gt; 25 (October 1962):3]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technological Influences on Nutrition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Much of modern society has become oriented toward science and technology. Engineering developments and food technologies have been extensive in recent years. Such things as prepared infant formulas have become readily available. The large-scale food production and service outside the home are expanding the habit of eating out. The increasing use of convenience food, both in the home and in the eating-out establishment, is another part of this expanding technology. This technology has influenced the food habits and patterns of eating for most of us in the United States. The fact that much food preparation is now done outside the home may very well influence the social aspects of food within the home, since this situation decreases individual family members’ reliance on each other for providing food to eat. Anyone can warm up his own TV dinner; he doesn’t need mother to do it for him. Probably the impact of technology has had an influence in stimulating the back-to-nature movement in food. Organic home gardening is becoming more popular, especially in groups among whom so-called natural or unprocessed foods are emphasized. For those who are part of this movement, actually more rather than less food preparation is done at home. Thus, we have opposite trends, both influenced by modern technology.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symbolic Uses of Foods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
With all of these technological influences, I think it is important that the meanings of food other than the merely biological ones be considered and talked about. Food, we might say, means security. The infant learns about security when his mother responds to his crying by giving him food. Familiar foods bring back memories of home and family and make one feel more secure even when away from home. A food package, home baking sent by a mother to a son or daughter in college, has much more significance than the empty calories it may contain, and I suspect that most of you know this from personal experience.

My nephew is now on a mission in Japan. Next to a letter from home, he seems to find a box of home-baked American cookies the best antidote for homesickness and for the problem of getting used to strange and unfamiliar foods—even though the cookies are only crumbs when they arrive in Japan, and he has to eat them with a spoon. The feeling of being full and physically satisfied and of knowing that there is a year’s supply of food stored in the basement also brings security of both a temporal and a spiritual nature, especially to the breadwinner of the family.

Food is also the symbol of hospitality, and it is used to show that one cares about others and is a friend. A new family is welcomed into the neighborhood with food. Gifts of food are given, both in times of happiness and holidays, and in times of sorrow when a loved one has been lost. Certain foods show status. Beefsteak has status in the United States. Taking someone out for a steak dinner usually means a little more than going out for a hamburger, although the nutritional quality of the meats is the same. White rice, although nutritionally inferior to brown rice, has status in some countries of the world and is preferred and eaten primarily for this reason. Foods commonly eaten by blacks in the southern United States—such as collards and turnip greens, fat pork, and certain fish—were for a long time not acceptable to whites because of status. Now, however, this attitude is changing, and soul food is being served and enjoyed in many prestigious restaurants throughout the country.

To quote Dr. Lee again:

&lt;i&gt;In our own society food is . . . the center of values and feelings that have nothing to do with nutrition, with the stilling of hunger pangs, or even with eating itself. Why else did the supermarkets in Detroit begin to stock black-eyed peas and mustard greens as soon as the influx of Southern immigrants hit the city? Why do stores in the big city carry queer things like seaweed, vine leaves pickled in brine, or dried stringy abominably (or is it deliciously?) smelling fish?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I will tell you why they carry vine leaves. They carry them for me because I yearn for them. For me, born and nurtured in the Near East, a vine leaf wrapped around cold rice cooked with olive oil, onions, herbs, pine-nuts, and currants, evokes a whole way of life. It brings to me a re-enactment of the time I sat around the table with my mother and my sisters, skillfully spreading out the wrinkled vine leaves with sensitive fingertips, gauging to a grain the right amount of filling as I piled it on each leaf, wrapping and rolling and stacking interminably, smelling the tangy scent, talking and quarreling and laughing and singing.&lt;/i&gt;[“Food and Human Existence”]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problems of Poor Nutrition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
How do the many meanings of food offer challenges on the frontiers of knowledge? There are worldwide problems of health related to poor nutrition. Poverty and ignorance are probably the major reasons for consumption of inadequate diets, but results of dietary surveys, at least in the United States, suggest that only at the very bottom of the economic scale, where there is the greatest poverty, does lack of money play the dominant factor in determining food choices. If a nutrition educator wants to help people make wiser food choices from a biological or a health standpoint, he must be interested in the process of changing food habits. And these habits, as we have been pointing out, may be very deeply ingrained. Anyone who works with changing any part of cultural food habits must study the entire cultural pattern carefully, because a change in food habits may have extensive and sometimes undesirable effects on other parts of the culture. Food habits are changing in many parts of the world; I don’t want to give the impression that you can’t change food habits. But they’re not necessarily always changing for the best. Affluence brings its own problems in relation to food. The challenge is to find out more about how good habits do change and to channel this discovery into areas that will bring lasting benefits to human health.

What are some of the other unsolved problems in nutrition waiting to challenge anyone who is willing? Changing patterns of disease over the years have pushed certain chronic diseases to the top of the list for causes of death in the United States. A leader is heart disease. The abnormality that underlies much of the heart disease is a condition with the unpronounceable name &lt;i&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/i&gt;, a type of degeneration of the arteries that is characterized by the accumulation of fatty substances as lesions in the walls of the medium and large arteries of the body. Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, narrowing and blocking the arteries that nourish the heart muscle itself, is probably the basic cause of heart attacks that claim the lives of so many relatively young American men each year. A recently published textbook says, “It is hard to overemphasize the enormity of the problem of atherosclerosis as a disease.” What does nutrition have to do with atherosclerosis? Here is another challenge. An elevated level of blood cholesterol and possibly triglycerides or plain fat in the blood is now considered to be a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, even though many people who have heart attacks do not have high levels of blood cholesterol. It has been shown in many research studies that the amount of fat in the blood is affected by the type and amount of food that is eaten. But in spite of the publication during the past fifteen years of literally thousands of research reports on this subject, an incontestable direct link between diet and coronary heart disease in the human has not been proven. Who could ask for a greater challenge than to solve or to clarify this problem and related ones for mankind?

In other areas, what is the relationship between the amount of fiber or bulk in the diet and cancer of the colon, which is a problem of increasing magnitude in the United States? How does nutrition affect the aging process? How can the accumulation of excess fatty tissue in the body, a condition that we call obesity, be prevented in an affluent society such as ours, where we have really outdone ourselves in providing, not only an abundance of food, but also an abundance of food that delights the palate without regard to the nutritional contribution that it might make to meeting the body’s physiological needs?

Is it really desirable to feed babies in a way that produces the most rapid growth possible? Is that peak growth curve going to bring long-term dividends? Some animal studies have suggested that baby rats fed both calories and protein a little sparingly, so that they did not grow quite as rapidly as they might have done, actually reaped benefits in longer life and in extended prime of life, or period of productivity. When the rats grew rapidly, they matured earlier—but they also died at a younger age. These are only animal studies. Is this pattern true for humans?

What are the roles of the trace elements, such as chromium, zinc, and copper, in human nutrition and in the prevention of disease? Will massive doses of vitamins really decrease illness? And is this a nutritional problem or is it a pharmacological one? Are vitamins being used as drugs in this case? After the researchers discover and clarify new knowledge, who translates these masses of scientific data into a practical language, understood by everyone who chooses the food he will eat each day, day by day and year by year?

The dietician or nutritionist has been called a translator of nutrition information. How effectively are we doing this? How can it be done better? Challenges—there are enough challenges for all of us, both in my academic discipline and in yours. Look for these challenges and get involved in them.

Finally, speaking of challenges, I would like to tell you that this has been a great challenge as well as a pleasure for me to talk with you today. I hope that while you are here at BYU you will each catch the spirit of discovering, the search for truth and light in the academic world, and that you will know the excitement that comes from making even a tiny contribution to expanding the frontiers of knowledge. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Thank you very much, and thank you, President Oaks. This is really my first opportunity to view this audience from this particular perspective, and as you can probably imagine, it is indeed overwhelming. But I do want to express, both for myself and I am sure for all of the other recipients of the Karl G. Maeser Awards today, our appreciation to the Alumni Association and to the University. We feel that this is an honor to be invited to join such distinguished company as the past recipients of these awards, and we do thank you. Since teachers wouldn’t be teachers without students, I would also like to take this opportunity today to express my own appreciation to my students and to tell them how much they mean to me and how special they are. I see them scattered over the audience.</p>
<p>At an assembly recognizing achievement in research and teaching within a university, it seems appropriate to talk about challenges on the frontiers of knowledge. A true university is on the frontiers of knowledge. It is a community of scholars dedicated to expanding the bounds of knowledge in all disciplines. The university offers both faculty and students a challenge, not only to learn what others have discovered, but also to feel that joy of discovering for themselves something really new after long and diligent research. Challenges create excitement, and the university world can be a very exciting place—for the fresh young undergraduate completing his first independent study project, for the young faculty member with a new Ph.D. just beginning to test his research abilities on his own, for the seasoned researcher with many publications to his credit and with the earned respect of his colleagues, and for everyone in between.</p>
<p>Dr. DeBakey, the noted heart surgeon, pointed out a few weeks ago when he visited this campus that every one of us has an important obligation to at least support scientific research that will be used to improve the quality of life for all mankind. Dr. DeBakey, of course, vividly demonstrated this point by showing films of lifesaving open-heart surgery that had been made possible through the efforts of hundreds of researchers working in laboratories throughout the world.</p>
<p>There are new challenges on the frontiers of knowledge in every academic discipline of the university. Many of the unsolved problems that present challenges overlap several disciplines, and interdisciplinary approaches to their solution are essential. We do need to work together in this community of scholars that is a university. Cooperation among disciplines and understanding of each other’s abilities and contributions will help greatly to further the knowledge explosion and the application of new knowledge to the problems of living.</p>
<h2><b>Food and Nutrition an Applied Science</b></h2>
<p>Today I would like to take my own academic area, which is nutrition and food science, to illustrate just a few of the unsolved problems that are today creating challenges. As I talk about some of the unanswered questions in nutrition, equally challenging problems in each of your own academic areas should come to mind. The problems may be different, but the challenges of discovery should have a common thread.</p>
<p>My chosen field of study is one that might be classified as an applied science. Consequently, it draws on many other areas for basic scientific principles to be applied to the practical problems dealing with food and nutrition. It draws on chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, medicine, sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, agriculture, and engineering—all important to food and nutrition. It is in itself interdisciplinary, at least in a sense. The area of nutrition and food science is also one that is somewhat unique because it actually involves a personal experience for everyone who lives. Whether you eat to live or live to eat, you are still involved with food. Everyone eats, or he doesn’t live very long. Thus, everyone is something of an expert on foods, at least where his own food habits are concerned. This situation creates both advantages and disadvantages for the educator and the researcher in nutrition and food science. It is an advantage in that he has a really tremendous audience interested in his subject, but it is sometimes a disadvantage in that he has to compete with so many self-styled authorities, to whom subjective personal experience is sometimes more important than documented research data.</p>
<p>Yes, the problems in nutrition and food science are many. It is a relatively new science, only about sixty years old. Although it is a rapidly expanding field, the expansion often seems to do little more than open up new areas of the unknown. And I think that this is common to most disciplines—a sometimes overwhelming recognition of the tremendous store of knowledge and application yet to be discovered.</p>
<h2><b>Social Implications of Food</b></h2>
<p>Let’s begin with some social science implications for food and nutrition. We might say that food is more than nutrition. Man as a biological being does require food to sustain life. He eats to satisfy his hunger and to meet his basic drive for food. But man is also a social being, and food is intimately woven into the social, psychological, and intellectual lives of men. Men have learned to live and work together and have organized themselves into societies. As human infants grow and develop, they are incorporated into one of these societies through varied experiences, and many of these experiences involve food. The term <i>culture</i>may be used to describe a way of life in which there are common customs or rules for behavior and in which there is a common understanding among members of the group. Food is filled with many different meanings and much symbolism for all individuals at various ages and stages of their maturity. Food is part of the fabric of life, and this fact must be recognized by anyone who seeks to change or to modify the food patterns of individuals and groups.</p>
<p>An anthropologist, Dorothy Lee, has written about food and human existence:</p>
<p><i>When I speak of FOOD AND HUMAN EXISTENCE, I am not trying to use a special synonym for the phrase “nutrition and life.” I mean something beyond mere biochemical nutrition and more than mere physical survival. Food can engage me completely as a person. It can bring to life my keen anticipation, my impatient or happy waiting; it can evoke my memory in all its pain and joy; it can pierce me with nostalgia; it can revolt me to the point of vomiting. Its preparation can be an act of relatedness, of obligation, of self-fulfillment, of creativity, of love; its eating can be participation and communion. Let us hope it also nourishes me physically, supplying me with the proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, and other nutrients I need to stay alive and healthy so that I can experience the fullness of human existence.</i> [“Food and Human Existence,” National Dairy Council <i>Nutrition News</i> 25 (October 1962):3]</p>
<h2><b>Technological Influences on Nutrition</b></h2>
<p>Much of modern society has become oriented toward science and technology. Engineering developments and food technologies have been extensive in recent years. Such things as prepared infant formulas have become readily available. The large-scale food production and service outside the home are expanding the habit of eating out. The increasing use of convenience food, both in the home and in the eating-out establishment, is another part of this expanding technology. This technology has influenced the food habits and patterns of eating for most of us in the United States. The fact that much food preparation is now done outside the home may very well influence the social aspects of food within the home, since this situation decreases individual family members’ reliance on each other for providing food to eat. Anyone can warm up his own TV dinner; he doesn’t need mother to do it for him. Probably the impact of technology has had an influence in stimulating the back-to-nature movement in food. Organic home gardening is becoming more popular, especially in groups among whom so-called natural or unprocessed foods are emphasized. For those who are part of this movement, actually more rather than less food preparation is done at home. Thus, we have opposite trends, both influenced by modern technology.</p>
<h2><b>Symbolic Uses of Foods</b></h2>
<p>With all of these technological influences, I think it is important that the meanings of food other than the merely biological ones be considered and talked about. Food, we might say, means security. The infant learns about security when his mother responds to his crying by giving him food. Familiar foods bring back memories of home and family and make one feel more secure even when away from home. A food package, home baking sent by a mother to a son or daughter in college, has much more significance than the empty calories it may contain, and I suspect that most of you know this from personal experience.</p>
<p>My nephew is now on a mission in Japan. Next to a letter from home, he seems to find a box of home-baked American cookies the best antidote for homesickness and for the problem of getting used to strange and unfamiliar foods—even though the cookies are only crumbs when they arrive in Japan, and he has to eat them with a spoon. The feeling of being full and physically satisfied and of knowing that there is a year’s supply of food stored in the basement also brings security of both a temporal and a spiritual nature, especially to the breadwinner of the family.</p>
<p>Food is also the symbol of hospitality, and it is used to show that one cares about others and is a friend. A new family is welcomed into the neighborhood with food. Gifts of food are given, both in times of happiness and holidays, and in times of sorrow when a loved one has been lost. Certain foods show status. Beefsteak has status in the United States. Taking someone out for a steak dinner usually means a little more than going out for a hamburger, although the nutritional quality of the meats is the same. White rice, although nutritionally inferior to brown rice, has status in some countries of the world and is preferred and eaten primarily for this reason. Foods commonly eaten by blacks in the southern United States—such as collards and turnip greens, fat pork, and certain fish—were for a long time not acceptable to whites because of status. Now, however, this attitude is changing, and soul food is being served and enjoyed in many prestigious restaurants throughout the country.</p>
<p>To quote Dr. Lee again:</p>
<p><i>In our own society food is . . . the center of values and feelings that have nothing to do with nutrition, with the stilling of hunger pangs, or even with eating itself. Why else did the supermarkets in Detroit begin to stock black-eyed peas and mustard greens as soon as the influx of Southern immigrants hit the city? Why do stores in the big city carry queer things like seaweed, vine leaves pickled in brine, or dried stringy abominably (or is it deliciously?) smelling fish?</i></p>
<p><i>I will tell you why they carry vine leaves. They carry them for me because I yearn for them. For me, born and nurtured in the Near East, a vine leaf wrapped around cold rice cooked with olive oil, onions, herbs, pine-nuts, and currants, evokes a whole way of life. It brings to me a re-enactment of the time I sat around the table with my mother and my sisters, skillfully spreading out the wrinkled vine leaves with sensitive fingertips, gauging to a grain the right amount of filling as I piled it on each leaf, wrapping and rolling and stacking interminably, smelling the tangy scent, talking and quarreling and laughing and singing.</i>[“Food and Human Existence”]</p>
<h2><b>Problems of Poor Nutrition</b></h2>
<p>How do the many meanings of food offer challenges on the frontiers of knowledge? There are worldwide problems of health related to poor nutrition. Poverty and ignorance are probably the major reasons for consumption of inadequate diets, but results of dietary surveys, at least in the United States, suggest that only at the very bottom of the economic scale, where there is the greatest poverty, does lack of money play the dominant factor in determining food choices. If a nutrition educator wants to help people make wiser food choices from a biological or a health standpoint, he must be interested in the process of changing food habits. And these habits, as we have been pointing out, may be very deeply ingrained. Anyone who works with changing any part of cultural food habits must study the entire cultural pattern carefully, because a change in food habits may have extensive and sometimes undesirable effects on other parts of the culture. Food habits are changing in many parts of the world; I don’t want to give the impression that you can’t change food habits. But they’re not necessarily always changing for the best. Affluence brings its own problems in relation to food. The challenge is to find out more about how good habits do change and to channel this discovery into areas that will bring lasting benefits to human health.</p>
<p>What are some of the other unsolved problems in nutrition waiting to challenge anyone who is willing? Changing patterns of disease over the years have pushed certain chronic diseases to the top of the list for causes of death in the United States. A leader is heart disease. The abnormality that underlies much of the heart disease is a condition with the unpronounceable name <i>atherosclerosis</i>, a type of degeneration of the arteries that is characterized by the accumulation of fatty substances as lesions in the walls of the medium and large arteries of the body. Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, narrowing and blocking the arteries that nourish the heart muscle itself, is probably the basic cause of heart attacks that claim the lives of so many relatively young American men each year. A recently published textbook says, “It is hard to overemphasize the enormity of the problem of atherosclerosis as a disease.” What does nutrition have to do with atherosclerosis? Here is another challenge. An elevated level of blood cholesterol and possibly triglycerides or plain fat in the blood is now considered to be a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, even though many people who have heart attacks do not have high levels of blood cholesterol. It has been shown in many research studies that the amount of fat in the blood is affected by the type and amount of food that is eaten. But in spite of the publication during the past fifteen years of literally thousands of research reports on this subject, an incontestable direct link between diet and coronary heart disease in the human has not been proven. Who could ask for a greater challenge than to solve or to clarify this problem and related ones for mankind?</p>
<p>In other areas, what is the relationship between the amount of fiber or bulk in the diet and cancer of the colon, which is a problem of increasing magnitude in the United States? How does nutrition affect the aging process? How can the accumulation of excess fatty tissue in the body, a condition that we call obesity, be prevented in an affluent society such as ours, where we have really outdone ourselves in providing, not only an abundance of food, but also an abundance of food that delights the palate without regard to the nutritional contribution that it might make to meeting the body’s physiological needs?</p>
<p>Is it really desirable to feed babies in a way that produces the most rapid growth possible? Is that peak growth curve going to bring long-term dividends? Some animal studies have suggested that baby rats fed both calories and protein a little sparingly, so that they did not grow quite as rapidly as they might have done, actually reaped benefits in longer life and in extended prime of life, or period of productivity. When the rats grew rapidly, they matured earlier—but they also died at a younger age. These are only animal studies. Is this pattern true for humans?</p>
<p>What are the roles of the trace elements, such as chromium, zinc, and copper, in human nutrition and in the prevention of disease? Will massive doses of vitamins really decrease illness? And is this a nutritional problem or is it a pharmacological one? Are vitamins being used as drugs in this case? After the researchers discover and clarify new knowledge, who translates these masses of scientific data into a practical language, understood by everyone who chooses the food he will eat each day, day by day and year by year?</p>
<p>The dietician or nutritionist has been called a translator of nutrition information. How effectively are we doing this? How can it be done better? Challenges—there are enough challenges for all of us, both in my academic discipline and in yours. Look for these challenges and get involved in them.</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of challenges, I would like to tell you that this has been a great challenge as well as a pleasure for me to talk with you today. I hope that while you are here at BYU you will each catch the spirit of discovering, the search for truth and light in the academic world, and that you will know the excitement that comes from making even a tiny contribution to expanding the frontiers of knowledge. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I came to campus this morning, I had a bit of a panic, and it wasn’t at the thought of you, because you all are an awesome sight. It was seeing the signs—those big signs at the entrance to campus. I have to admit that those signs always give me a little panicky feeling because they are a reminder that this is the place where I was abandoned by my parents. This is the place where I was left to figure things out on my own and to wonder, “Am I even smart enough to be here?”
But today these signs gave me this panic because I knew I was coming here to campus—a place that cultivates knowledge and reveres intelligence—to talk about the dangers of knowledge and the downside of intelligence. Essentially I was coming here to ask this question: Can we actually get too smart?
You have probably heard this saying: “Knowledge is power.” But today I want to ask, Is there actually more power in not knowing? I want to make a case for ignorance—not ignorance as in stupidity or the lack of education but simply the lack of certainty.
My dad had a saying. He used to say, “It looks like someone has gotten too big for their britches.” By this he meant that they were a little too full of themselves, a little too much of a smarty-pants. As we gain knowledge and intelligence and as we get smart, can we get a little too full of ourselves? A little too smart for our own good and maybe even a little too smart for the good of others?
I want to center our conversation today on two questions. They are both questions that I have spent years researching and writing about. The first is a question about leadership: How does the knowledge of a leader affect the intelligence of the team around them and why is it that some leaders seem to amplify the intelligence of people around them while other leaders seem to just suck the intelligence and life right out of a room?
That is our first question. The second question is a question about learning and performance. I want to begin with the first question.
Multiplier Leadership
When I graduated from BYU and from the Marriott School, I took a job working for a small maverick software company called Oracle. No one knew this company at the time; people thought it was a toothbrush manufacturer. Oracle had a very simple and clear hiring ­strategy: hire the top grads out of the top schools, mix them all together, and just see what happens.
At the time, Oracle didn’t recruit at BYU, and Oracle did not actively recruit me. I simply found Oracle and wiggled my way into the mix. It wasn’t as if I felt like I didn’t belong there; I just felt really lucky to be working there and to be working around all these brilliant people. So I became a genius watcher.
I could see how intelligence—just raw ­brilliance and smarts—was a really powerful tool for growth and for innovation, but I could also see how intelligence was being used as a weapon. W</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful for the opportunity the administration affords me to speak to you today. I am particularly grateful for the friends and family who have gathered here to support me and for the special privilege of having my father and my mother, Larry and Kathy Hickman, in the audience. So much of what I have been able to become is due to them.
In the next few minutes I hope to make the case that through the grace of Christ’s Atonement both you and I have been given the chance to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost in our reading, writing, and speaking in ways that will open our eyes to new knowledge and to better ways of thinking about the challenges that beset us.
For me, one of the most intriguing chapters of the Book of Mormon is Ether 12, in which Moroni pauses in his translation of the Jaredite record to catalogue the many miracles that occurred because of faith put into action. Partway through this list Moroni seems to face a crisis of his own faith—at least as it touches upon the future reception of the scriptural record that he is creating for an audience in our day and time. He writes:
And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast made us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;
And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.
Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words. [Ether 12:23–25]
As an English professor whose own work focuses on twentieth-century and contemporary American literary history, several aspects of Moroni’s concerns interest me. First, Moroni’s sense of our time—that it would be an era characterized, among other things, by “mockery”—strikes me as unusually perceptive. Ours is indeed an age whose dominant mode is that of irony. On the heels of two world wars and many other regional ones, in the wake of some of the worst genocides in history, and in the aftermath of countless scandals in politics, business, and even religion, irony emerges in our day as a kind of cultural defense mechanism, a way of acknowledging that since things are rarely what they appear to be, nothing should be taken without the proverbial grain of salt.
In our day we luxuriate in an unprecedented omnipresence of information but paradoxically distrust this information more than ever because of its potential for ma</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The operation on the infected leg of the Prophet Joseph Smith gives us a story about nobility and the comfort that comes from faith in a loving father. There is also another, less well-known lesson hidden in this story. The doctor attending Joseph at the end of the ordeal is sometimes portrayed as a humble country doctor with uncertain skills. But Elder Neal A. Maxwell pointed out that this was not the case, citing Dr. LeRoy S. Wirthlin, a Latter-day Saint doctor who researched the event:
The medical doctor in final attendance . . . was Dr. Nathan Smith, founder of the Dartmouth Medical School. He brought two doctors and several medical students with him to attend to young Joseph. . . . Dr. Nathan Smith was highly qualified, and he was using a very advanced technique. Thus “the only man in America who could save [Joseph’s] leg was just five miles away.”1
Elder Maxwell then went on to explain how Dr. Smith happened to be in the vicinity of Joseph Smith’s home because his plans to leave the area were “delayed by a typhoid epidemic.”2
In addition to the academic and spiritual knowledge you are gaining at BYU, the skills you are developing are also very important—though, like Dr. Smith, you probably do not now understand how important they will be, nor to whom they will be valuable. When Dr. Smith’s skills were needed, the Lord managed the circumstances to make them available to Joseph when and where they were critically needed.
Skill, even specialized skill, plays an important role in the Lord’s plans. We are told that the Lord often answers our prayers through the ministrations of our family, friends, neighbors, and church leaders. In the case of Joseph’s leg, it was a stranger who had the necessary skill to save his leg. As Saints we are taught to rely on God to watch over us and to supply our needs, but we also have the responsibility to prepare ourselves however possible against a time of need. That’s why we follow the counsel of the prophets to strive to obtain all of the education we possibly can. Brigham Young described the scope of the skills and knowledge we might consider cultivating: “Every accomplishment, every polished grace, every useful attainment in mathematics, music, and in all science and art belong to the Saints.”3
We do not rely on the arm of flesh, but a steady, experienced arm in the time of need, guided by the Spirit of God, can make a difference: “To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.”4 This includes learning in useful skills.
Many of us have patriarchal blessings that advise us to cultivate our abilities in a particular area. I would like to share with you some of my own understandings about skills and how they might figure into our ability to perform our earthly missions.
We could begin by asking, “How pervasive are skills in our everyday actions?” Some skil</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">If there is one thing that distinguishes the university from other institutions of learning, it is the expectation to advance knowledge. The mission of most educational institutions is to pass on what is already known. Our high school teachers distilled their lessons from books that had already been written. At the university we engage in this dissemination too, but we have the further obligation to add to the bank of human knowledge by asking new questions or using new sources and methods to find better answers to old questions. Increasingly, through programs such as mentored learning, rather than just giving students the answers to the questions that have already been asked, we are inviting you to join us in the asking of the questions. We want you to experience the university as a place to actively pursue knowledge rather than only passively acquire it.
Justly or not, we often credit the Greeks for this inquisitive approach to the world. They did invent historia, a word that for them had a more encompassing meaning than the word history has for us today. For the Greeks, history meant knowledge, but only of a particular kind: history was any knowledge that had been acquired through inquiry, by asking questions. This was a significant development that made the Greeks among the most learned of cultures in multiple fields. When Herodotus, who we like to call the first historian, wrote The Histories, also called The Inquiries, of the origins of the Greco-Persian wars and of the cultures of the Near East, he did so based not on hearsay, rumor, and prejudice, which had been the common practice, but by asking lots of questions and engaging in extensive travel in the places he wrote about. He did not always get the facts right, but what is important is that he made every effort—by careful and persistent questioning—to get them right.
Today I’d like to address the value and practice of learning, particularly learning by asking questions. Of all the lessons Christ taught in the Sermon on the Mount, the counsel “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find”1 is among the most cited in later scripture. What is the import of that exhortation for those of us who should be engaged in the pursuit of secular knowledge, eternal truths, and personal virtues?
Most of what you and I know we picked up passively: in conversations overheard, from unsolicited lectures from our parents, from TV productions, and in casual reading. In other words, most of what I know came to me without my seeking it, without my asking questions that led to new knowledge, and hence that knowledge doesn’t qualify as “history” by the Greek definition. There is nothing at all wrong with passive learning; it will forever be an essential means of both cultural and academic transmission. As a professional student, I have sat through what must be hundreds of hours of lectures, and I have learned a g</span>
