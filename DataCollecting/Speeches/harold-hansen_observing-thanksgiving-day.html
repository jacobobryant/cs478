  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="President Oaks, my fellow colleagues, students of Brigham Young University, they say that confession is good for the soul. I don’t know what the state of my soul is, but I’m confessing that this frightens me. My students should gain some feeling of security that even the old man can get into trouble!

As I’ve been preparing to respond to this invitation to speak, finding it difficult to reach a decision about what I should say, I was reminded of some lines by the great East Indian poet Tagor. “I’ve spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument while the song I came to sing remains unsung.” I hope for all our sakes that I will not be in that situation today.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;History of Thanksgiving Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The human family has always followed the practice of special days to acknowledge God’s goodness. So it was that the Plymouth colonists celebrated their second winter spent in the New World. The first dreadful winter in Massachusetts had killed nearly half of the members of the colony, but hope sprang anew the late summer of 1621. The corn harvest brought rejoicing, and the forests and streams were abundant with wild game and fish. The colonists understood the environment better the second season than they had the first. They found that they could harmonize their lives in this cold, bitter climate. Governor William Bradford decreed that December 13, 1621, be set aside as a day of feasting and prayer to demonstrate the gratitude the colonists felt toward God. The women of the colony spent days preparing for the feast. Foods were boiled, baked, and roasted. The children were kept very busy turning roasts on spits or iron rods in front of the open fires. More than eighty Indians attended the feast. The Indians brought wild turkeys and venison as their share. The tables were set outdoors, and all the people sat around the combined tables like one large family. Prayers, sermons, and songs of praise accompanied the feasting. Three days were devoted to the Thanksgiving, and then the Indians returned to the forests and the colonists to their toil.

Word of the Plymouth celebration traveled to other New England towns and colonies. Then Thanksgiving Day became a custom. Sporadic attempts were made to formulize a special day. In 1789 President George Washington was urged by the Congress to proclaim a national holiday. I was struck forcibly by the content of his message, how aptly it suits today. May I read it:

&lt;i&gt;Whereas, it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits and humbly to implore His protection and favor; and whereas, both Houses of Congress, have by their joint Committee requested me “to recommend to the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer,” to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great &amp;amp; glorious Being who is the Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we then all unite in rendering unto Him our service and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the People of this Country . . . ; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of His Providence in the course and conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord &amp;amp; Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our National and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several &amp;amp; relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a government of wise, just, &amp;amp; constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed &amp;amp; obeyed; to protect &amp;amp; guide all sovereigns &amp;amp; nations and to bless them with good governments, Peace &amp;amp; Concord; to promote the knowledge &amp;amp; practice of true religion &amp;amp; virtue . . . ; &amp;amp; generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal Prosperity as He alone knows to be best.&lt;/i&gt;

It was a woman, Mrs. Sarah Hale, editor of &lt;i&gt;Godey’s Ladies’ Book&lt;/i&gt;, who spent thirty years promoting the setting of a legal Thanksgiving Day. She wrote and published repeated pleas to the general public and wrote letters to the various presidents. Finally, in 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation setting aside the last Thursday of November in that year as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficient Father. It was not until 1941 that Congress finally ruled Thanksgiving Day would be a legal holiday.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time for Gratitude&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It’s now some 354 years since Governor Bradford decreed a Thanksgiving Day, and I want to ask, “How do we value and deserve and observe this day? Do we remember only the feasting?” I think not. One of the great human sins is ingratitude. Surely we have not grown so cynical that we cannot have the spiritual insight to observe the “prayer and praise” part of the day. Virginia Oliver says: “Thanksgiving is a time for remembering—remembering the good gifts of every day, the countless blessings that are ever ours; for remembering Thanksgiving Days that are past, the memories of families and friends, remembering at each time this day draws near the hearts of mankind, joined in grateful praise.”

&lt;i&gt;Did I forget to thank thee, Lord,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For things that may seem small:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A flower by the wayside, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A wild bird’s lovely call,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For all the daily happenings&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That we call commonplace—&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For autumn and for sunsets&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And a neighbor’s smiling face?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For life is made of little things,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;So let me not forget&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To count my smallest blessings,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And before the sun is set,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To thank thee, Lord, for every one&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That adds a note of cheer, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And our blessings will be multiplied&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Before another year.&lt;/i&gt;
[Pauline Stone, “Little Things”]

The longer we live, the more we realize the blessings that lie in everyday living. Just a few—the marvel of good health, the dearness of home and loved ones, the little treasures that money cannot buy, the wonder of the world of nature, freedom under God, and the bounty which we enjoy in this good land. Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate these and many other blessings. It is a way of life. Let us be thankful that there still is sunshine, that we still can glimpse the blue of the sky and, in our onward way, continue to look up. One of the great characters I remember with affection on this campus when I arrived many years ago was Herald R. Clark. We used to pass early each morning just north of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. While he was still some twenty yards away from me, he’d call out, “Look up, H. I., look up!” And I’d look toward the east. I’d get things that would fill my soul for an entire day. But I learned something else, that I had been carrying my head down with burdens. He taught me to look up, and it made life just a little sweeter. I want to be thankful for friends with kind smiles, cheerful words. This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a time for grateful thanksgiving. Shakespeare sang, “O Lord, who lends me life, lend me a heart replete with thankfulness.”

As I was looking through the discourses of Brigham Young and noting his words about complainers and grumblers, I thought that maybe it would be appropriate, at least for me, to listen to his challenge. He was speaking about Zion’s Camp, en route to Missouri:

&lt;i&gt;We had grumblers, . . . unruly and discontented spirits. . . . Brother Joseph led, counseled and guided the company, and contended against those unruly, evil disposed persons. When we arrived in Missouri, the Lord spoke to his servant Joseph and said, “I have accepted your offering,” and we had the privilege to return again. On my return many friends asked me, . . . “Who has it benefited? . . . If the Lord did command it to be done, what object had he in view of doing so?” . . . I then learned that those persons who asked me such questions were weak in faith and, like a faulty column in an edifice, could not bear up under the burden designed to rest upon them. . . . I wish this fact to sink into your hearts, that when men or women have doubts, they also have fear; and when they have fear, they are in danger of what? Of themselves. Want of confidence is the parent of moral imbecility and intellectual weakness. Hear it, ye Saints, that man or women that is crowned with crowns of glory, immortality, and eternal lives will never be heard to grumble or complain. I told those brethren that I was well paid—paid with heavy interest—yea that my measure was filled to overflowing with the knowledge that I had received by travelling with the Prophet. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Journal of Discourses&lt;/i&gt;, 10:20]

At this season I have much to be grateful for—the little things, but also the larger gifts that I live within the affection of a caring Church, that that Church teaches me I am individual and personal in the sight of God, and there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; opportunity for affection between me and my Father in heaven, and that there is a living prophet who can and will guide and will help to lift the burden of the time. My friends, this is my testimony to you this day, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>President Oaks, my fellow colleagues, students of Brigham Young University, they say that confession is good for the soul. I don’t know what the state of my soul is, but I’m confessing that this frightens me. My students should gain some feeling of security that even the old man can get into trouble!</p>
<p>As I’ve been preparing to respond to this invitation to speak, finding it difficult to reach a decision about what I should say, I was reminded of some lines by the great East Indian poet Tagor. “I’ve spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument while the song I came to sing remains unsung.” I hope for all our sakes that I will not be in that situation today.</p>
<h2><b>History of Thanksgiving Day</b></h2>
<p>The human family has always followed the practice of special days to acknowledge God’s goodness. So it was that the Plymouth colonists celebrated their second winter spent in the New World. The first dreadful winter in Massachusetts had killed nearly half of the members of the colony, but hope sprang anew the late summer of 1621. The corn harvest brought rejoicing, and the forests and streams were abundant with wild game and fish. The colonists understood the environment better the second season than they had the first. They found that they could harmonize their lives in this cold, bitter climate. Governor William Bradford decreed that December 13, 1621, be set aside as a day of feasting and prayer to demonstrate the gratitude the colonists felt toward God. The women of the colony spent days preparing for the feast. Foods were boiled, baked, and roasted. The children were kept very busy turning roasts on spits or iron rods in front of the open fires. More than eighty Indians attended the feast. The Indians brought wild turkeys and venison as their share. The tables were set outdoors, and all the people sat around the combined tables like one large family. Prayers, sermons, and songs of praise accompanied the feasting. Three days were devoted to the Thanksgiving, and then the Indians returned to the forests and the colonists to their toil.</p>
<p>Word of the Plymouth celebration traveled to other New England towns and colonies. Then Thanksgiving Day became a custom. Sporadic attempts were made to formulize a special day. In 1789 President George Washington was urged by the Congress to proclaim a national holiday. I was struck forcibly by the content of his message, how aptly it suits today. May I read it:</p>
<p><i>Whereas, it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits and humbly to implore His protection and favor; and whereas, both Houses of Congress, have by their joint Committee requested me “to recommend to the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer,” to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great &amp; glorious Being who is the Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we then all unite in rendering unto Him our service and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the People of this Country . . . ; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of His Providence in the course and conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord &amp; Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our National and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several &amp; relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a government of wise, just, &amp; constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed &amp; obeyed; to protect &amp; guide all sovereigns &amp; nations and to bless them with good governments, Peace &amp; Concord; to promote the knowledge &amp; practice of true religion &amp; virtue . . . ; &amp; generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal Prosperity as He alone knows to be best.</i></p>
<p>It was a woman, Mrs. Sarah Hale, editor of <i>Godey’s Ladies’ Book</i>, who spent thirty years promoting the setting of a legal Thanksgiving Day. She wrote and published repeated pleas to the general public and wrote letters to the various presidents. Finally, in 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation setting aside the last Thursday of November in that year as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficient Father. It was not until 1941 that Congress finally ruled Thanksgiving Day would be a legal holiday.</p>
<h2><b>Time for Gratitude</b></h2>
<p>It’s now some 354 years since Governor Bradford decreed a Thanksgiving Day, and I want to ask, “How do we value and deserve and observe this day? Do we remember only the feasting?” I think not. One of the great human sins is ingratitude. Surely we have not grown so cynical that we cannot have the spiritual insight to observe the “prayer and praise” part of the day. Virginia Oliver says: “Thanksgiving is a time for remembering—remembering the good gifts of every day, the countless blessings that are ever ours; for remembering Thanksgiving Days that are past, the memories of families and friends, remembering at each time this day draws near the hearts of mankind, joined in grateful praise.”</p>
<p><i>Did I forget to thank thee, Lord,</i><br />
<i>For things that may seem small:</i><br />
<i>A flower by the wayside, </i><br />
<i>A wild bird’s lovely call,</i></p>
<p><i>For all the daily happenings</i><br />
<i>That we call commonplace—</i><br />
<i>For autumn and for sunsets</i><br />
<i>And a neighbor’s smiling face?</i></p>
<p><i>For life is made of little things,</i><br />
<i>So let me not forget</i><br />
<i>To count my smallest blessings,</i><br />
<i>And before the sun is set,</i></p>
<p><i>To thank thee, Lord, for every one</i><br />
<i>That adds a note of cheer, </i><br />
<i>And our blessings will be multiplied</i><br />
<i>Before another year.</i><br />
[Pauline Stone, “Little Things”]</p>
<p>The longer we live, the more we realize the blessings that lie in everyday living. Just a few—the marvel of good health, the dearness of home and loved ones, the little treasures that money cannot buy, the wonder of the world of nature, freedom under God, and the bounty which we enjoy in this good land. Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate these and many other blessings. It is a way of life. Let us be thankful that there still is sunshine, that we still can glimpse the blue of the sky and, in our onward way, continue to look up. One of the great characters I remember with affection on this campus when I arrived many years ago was Herald R. Clark. We used to pass early each morning just north of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. While he was still some twenty yards away from me, he’d call out, “Look up, H. I., look up!” And I’d look toward the east. I’d get things that would fill my soul for an entire day. But I learned something else, that I had been carrying my head down with burdens. He taught me to look up, and it made life just a little sweeter. I want to be thankful for friends with kind smiles, cheerful words. This <i>is</i> a time for grateful thanksgiving. Shakespeare sang, “O Lord, who lends me life, lend me a heart replete with thankfulness.”</p>
<p>As I was looking through the discourses of Brigham Young and noting his words about complainers and grumblers, I thought that maybe it would be appropriate, at least for me, to listen to his challenge. He was speaking about Zion’s Camp, en route to Missouri:</p>
<p><i>We had grumblers, . . . unruly and discontented spirits. . . . Brother Joseph led, counseled and guided the company, and contended against those unruly, evil disposed persons. When we arrived in Missouri, the Lord spoke to his servant Joseph and said, “I have accepted your offering,” and we had the privilege to return again. On my return many friends asked me, . . . “Who has it benefited? . . . If the Lord did command it to be done, what object had he in view of doing so?” . . . I then learned that those persons who asked me such questions were weak in faith and, like a faulty column in an edifice, could not bear up under the burden designed to rest upon them. . . . I wish this fact to sink into your hearts, that when men or women have doubts, they also have fear; and when they have fear, they are in danger of what? Of themselves. Want of confidence is the parent of moral imbecility and intellectual weakness. Hear it, ye Saints, that man or women that is crowned with crowns of glory, immortality, and eternal lives will never be heard to grumble or complain. I told those brethren that I was well paid—paid with heavy interest—yea that my measure was filled to overflowing with the knowledge that I had received by travelling with the Prophet. </i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 10:20]</p>
<p>At this season I have much to be grateful for—the little things, but also the larger gifts that I live within the affection of a caring Church, that that Church teaches me I am individual and personal in the sight of God, and there <i>is</i> opportunity for affection between me and my Father in heaven, and that there is a living prophet who can and will guide and will help to lift the burden of the time. My friends, this is my testimony to you this day, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in ­general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question “What lack I yet?” and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, “Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer.”
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to “be more cheerful” or to “smile more often” or to “count their blessings.”
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happi­ness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing “an unconscious smile.”1 I have known people like that—­individuals who are continually smiling ­without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being “temple worthy,” what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day—and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet—and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to “thank the Lord thy God in all things” (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (Children’s Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song—“hear[ing] the song of a bird,” “look[ing] at the blue . . . sky,” having eyes to “see The color of butterfly wings,” and feeling “the wind as it rushes by.” Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, “What is a SWKT?” I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges—including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. [“Stories of the Century,” comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 1999–2000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lee’s memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the student’s tuition. . . .

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn “Count Your Blessings.” I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact—not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: “I can live for two months on a good compliment.”3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift—from friends, from family, from God—and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change people’s lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles—500 of it on foot. I’m not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I don’t believe I’ve ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lord’s hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries—our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease—we sometimes forget to confess the Lord’s hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimball’s statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Let’s take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
