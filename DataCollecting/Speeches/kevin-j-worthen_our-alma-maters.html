  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I have long been fascinated by words and language. My children would call me a word nerd. I’m the kind of person who wonders why we drive on parkways and park on driveways. Think about it. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Similarly, have you ever wondered if a fly lost its wings, would we call it a walk? Again, you have to think about it—and now you know why my children groan a lot when I try to use my sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;My love of language is one reason why I enjoy graduation ceremonies so much. At graduation we hear words that we don’t ordinarily use in everyday life. We use terms like &lt;i&gt;cum laude,&lt;/i&gt; with either &lt;i&gt;summa&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt; attached as modifiers; these are not terms typically bandied about during the family dinner hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Two of the terms we often hear at graduation are &lt;i&gt;alma mater&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;alumni.&lt;/i&gt; In a few minutes Amy Fennegan will officially welcome you graduates as alumni of BYU, and upon graduation, BYU will become your alma mater. Again, these are not words that we use in many other settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Interestingly, at least to me, and instructively, neither of these terms originated in connection with graduation or even higher education. &lt;i&gt;Alma mater&lt;/i&gt; is a two-word Latin term that literally translated means “bounteous [or] nourishing mother.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In its early form, “it was a title given by the Romans to several goddesses but in particular to Ceres and Cybele, both representing fostering mother figures.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The association with higher education came many centuries later when the University of Bologna—which many identify as the first university in the Western world—adopted as its motto &lt;i&gt;Alma mater studiorum,&lt;/i&gt; meaning “nurturing mother of studies.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Since that time &lt;i&gt;alma mater&lt;/i&gt; has been used in a variety of ways at universities. And the idea that universities play a special “nurturing” role in the development of their students—somewhat like though not identical to that of a parent—has taken hold in American society to the extent that the prevailing definition of &lt;i&gt;alma mater&lt;/i&gt; now is the university or college from which one has graduated.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The term &lt;i&gt;alumni&lt;/i&gt; similarly developed outside of academia and likewise referred to a special, almost parent-like relationship. In Rome, &lt;i&gt;alumni&lt;/i&gt; was first used as a term that generally referred to “children abandoned by their parents and brought up in the home of someone else”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;—what we might now call foster children. Over time the term &lt;i&gt;alumni&lt;/i&gt; came to also refer to students or pupils in an educational setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;In this setting today it is worth noting that the two terms we hear often at graduation—&lt;i&gt;alma mater&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;alumni—&lt;/i&gt;both originally referred to a special relationship, one very much like but also different from that between a parent and a child. Moreover, the two terms were linguistically connected from the outset, as they both derive to some extent from the same Latin term &lt;i&gt;alere,&lt;/i&gt; which means “nourish.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Now some of you are no doubt beginning to wonder if there is a point to this lesson on the etymology of these two Latin terms. Let me suggest three short ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;First, given their origin and history, hearing the terms &lt;i&gt;alma mater&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;alumni&lt;/i&gt; should remind all of you graduates that you have not achieved the success we are celebrating this day on your own. In addition to your own family ­members—parents, spouses, children, siblings, and grandparents—who have supported you through this endeavor, there are many others, including many at this university, who have nurtured and shaped you in ways that have enhanced and become part of your university education. These alma maters—these nurturing mothers and fathers—include faculty members who have tried to help you learn and progress both intellectually and spiritually, who have loved you almost as much as their own children, and who have loved you enough to draw from you the very best you had to offer—and sometimes more than you thought you had to give. These alma maters also include others who have provided services such as meals, technology, clean rooms, and beautiful grounds—all in an effort to create a stimulating setting in which learning “by study and also by faith”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; can flourish. These alma maters include your classmates, who in some ways have contributed to your deep learning beyond what the faculty has done. And these alma maters include both generous donors and humble tithe payers, who have given of their funds to support you, even though they have never met you and may never come to Provo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Each of these individuals has in a sense nurtured you as an alumnus, or foster child, whom they took in and loved. Each of them is in a sense your alma mater. When you hear the term &lt;i&gt;alma mater,&lt;/i&gt; I urge you to think not of buildings or bricks and mortar but of people and relationships. When you proudly proclaim that BYU is your alma mater, please have in mind all the alma maters who have contributed to you in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; Second, the fact that you have been nurtured by so many gives rise to an obligation to nurture others. As alumni who have benefited from the care of others when you may have felt alone, you have a responsibility to become alma maters to others who may one day feel abandoned. As the hymn reminds us, “because [we] have been given much, [we] too must give.”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; “Enter to learn; go forth to serve” is not just a motto; it is a university and gospel imperative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; Third, I hope that when you hear the terms &lt;i&gt;alma mater&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;alumni&lt;/i&gt; and remember their familial origins and connotations, you reflect on the glorious truth that as important as the relationship is between you as alumni and the many people who have made BYU your alma mater, it pales in comparison to one central and eternal family relationship. I hope your time at BYU has increased your appreciation of the breadth of meaning and the depth of importance of the eternal truth that “each [of you] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.”&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; I urge you to reflect on that truth at this time of celebration and gratitude. It will provide hope in times of distress and motivation to help others in times of success. If you do that, we, your alma maters, will be pleased to call you our alumni. That it may be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<p class="p1">I have long been fascinated by words and language. My children would call me a word nerd. I’m the kind of person who wonders why we drive on parkways and park on driveways. Think about it. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Similarly, have you ever wondered if a fly lost its wings, would we call it a walk? Again, you have to think about it—and now you know why my children groan a lot when I try to use my sense of humor.</p>
<p class="p1">My love of language is one reason why I enjoy graduation ceremonies so much. At graduation we hear words that we don’t ordinarily use in everyday life. We use terms like <i>cum laude,</i> with either <i>summa</i> or <i>magna</i> attached as modifiers; these are not terms typically bandied about during the family dinner hour.</p>
<p class="p1">Two of the terms we often hear at graduation are <i>alma mater</i> and <i>alumni.</i> In a few minutes Amy Fennegan will officially welcome you graduates as alumni of BYU, and upon graduation, BYU will become your alma mater. Again, these are not words that we use in many other settings.</p>
<p class="p1">Interestingly, at least to me, and instructively, neither of these terms originated in connection with graduation or even higher education. <i>Alma mater</i> is a two-word Latin term that literally translated means “bounteous [or] nourishing mother.”<sup>1</sup> In its early form, “it was a title given by the Romans to several goddesses but in particular to Ceres and Cybele, both representing fostering mother figures.”<sup>2</sup> The association with higher education came many centuries later when the University of Bologna—which many identify as the first university in the Western world—adopted as its motto <i>Alma mater studiorum,</i> meaning “nurturing mother of studies.”<sup>3</sup> Since that time <i>alma mater</i> has been used in a variety of ways at universities. And the idea that universities play a special “nurturing” role in the development of their students—somewhat like though not identical to that of a parent—has taken hold in American society to the extent that the prevailing definition of <i>alma mater</i> now is the university or college from which one has graduated.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p class="p1">The term <i>alumni</i> similarly developed outside of academia and likewise referred to a special, almost parent-like relationship. In Rome, <i>alumni</i> was first used as a term that generally referred to “children abandoned by their parents and brought up in the home of someone else”<sup>5</sup>—what we might now call foster children. Over time the term <i>alumni</i> came to also refer to students or pupils in an educational setting.</p>
<p class="p1">In this setting today it is worth noting that the two terms we hear often at graduation—<i>alma mater</i> and <i>alumni—</i>both originally referred to a special relationship, one very much like but also different from that between a parent and a child. Moreover, the two terms were linguistically connected from the outset, as they both derive to some extent from the same Latin term <i>alere,</i> which means “nourish.”<sup>6</sup></p>
<p class="p1">Now some of you are no doubt beginning to wonder if there is a point to this lesson on the etymology of these two Latin terms. Let me suggest three short ideas.</p>
<p class="p1">First, given their origin and history, hearing the terms <i>alma mater</i> and <i>alumni</i> should remind all of you graduates that you have not achieved the success we are celebrating this day on your own. In addition to your own family ­members—parents, spouses, children, siblings, and grandparents—who have supported you through this endeavor, there are many others, including many at this university, who have nurtured and shaped you in ways that have enhanced and become part of your university education. These alma maters—these nurturing mothers and fathers—include faculty members who have tried to help you learn and progress both intellectually and spiritually, who have loved you almost as much as their own children, and who have loved you enough to draw from you the very best you had to offer—and sometimes more than you thought you had to give. These alma maters also include others who have provided services such as meals, technology, clean rooms, and beautiful grounds—all in an effort to create a stimulating setting in which learning “by study and also by faith”<sup>7</sup> can flourish. These alma maters include your classmates, who in some ways have contributed to your deep learning beyond what the faculty has done. And these alma maters include both generous donors and humble tithe payers, who have given of their funds to support you, even though they have never met you and may never come to Provo.</p>
<p class="p1">Each of these individuals has in a sense nurtured you as an alumnus, or foster child, whom they took in and loved. Each of them is in a sense your alma mater. When you hear the term <i>alma mater,</i> I urge you to think not of buildings or bricks and mortar but of people and relationships. When you proudly proclaim that BYU is your alma mater, please have in mind all the alma maters who have contributed to you in so many ways.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Second, the fact that you have been nurtured by so many gives rise to an obligation to nurture others. As alumni who have benefited from the care of others when you may have felt alone, you have a responsibility to become alma maters to others who may one day feel abandoned. As the hymn reminds us, “because [we] have been given much, [we] too must give.”<sup>8</sup> “Enter to learn; go forth to serve” is not just a motto; it is a university and gospel imperative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"> Third, I hope that when you hear the terms <i>alma mater</i> and <i>alumni</i> and remember their familial origins and connotations, you reflect on the glorious truth that as important as the relationship is between you as alumni and the many people who have made BYU your alma mater, it pales in comparison to one central and eternal family relationship. I hope your time at BYU has increased your appreciation of the breadth of meaning and the depth of importance of the eternal truth that “each [of you] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.”<sup>9</sup> I urge you to reflect on that truth at this time of celebration and gratitude. It will provide hope in times of distress and motivation to help others in times of success. If you do that, we, your alma maters, will be pleased to call you our alumni. That it may be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is wonderful to be here. This is not an opportunity I would have imagined for myself. It is truly a future only God could see for me. I am grateful for a Father in Heaven who knows me—who knows my potential and who wants me to become like Him. I can’t wait to someday see like He does—to know everything and to see the future and not just the past. But for now I will stand like a little girl on my Father’s feet, holding His hands and trusting Him as He guides me through the dance of this life. As His daughter, I hope someday to grow up to be just like Him. I am trying to become more like Him now by learning as much as I can and by working to refine the spiritual gifts He has given me.
Daughters of God
Revelation given in the book of Joel speaks of the role of women in the latter days when it says that, in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ,
I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, . . . 
 . . . and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. [Joel 2:28–29]
Your daughters shall prophesy! In these last days we are meant to seek and receive spiritual revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost. Like Rebekah, Hannah, Elisabeth, and Mary, women are meant to receive direct spiritual revelation through the gifts of the Spirit. Like Miriam (see Exodus 15:20), Deborah (see Judges 4:4), Huldah (see 2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22), and Anna (see Luke 2:36), we can develop the spiritual gift of prophecy and refine our ability to communicate with our Father in Heaven in ways that affect our own spiritual development and have a positive impact on the world around us.1
These spiritual gifts bring us closer to the image of God, in which we were created. Through her choice to partake of the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden, Mother Eve made it possible for each of us to exercise our agency in a world filled with choices, thereby providing a way for us to spiritually develop. I do not think it was an accident that by knowledge she opened a pathway that would allow us to become more like God. I believe this sets an eternal pattern. “The glory of God is intelligence” (D&amp;C 93:36), and we must likewise enhance our own inherent intelligence in order to become like Him and receive His ­spiritual gifts.
How do we reach this divine potential? How do we strength</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I count it a great blessing and a privilege to speak today at this university conference. I love to come to this campus.
Before I begin my formal remarks, I am going to tell you a little story about why I feel so strongly about this place. It is not only because as a student here for a year after my mission I found my professional calling to be a teacher and a scholar at the feet of truly, truly inspiring teachers like Larry T. Wimmer and others, but it is also because I met Sue here.
I want to tell you this little story about why I get a chill that just covers me when I walk on this campus. I had met Sue, and we were in the same family home evening group. We went for a walk one night, and I had the very distinct impression from the Spirit: “This is your ­eternal companion.” Fortunately, she had the same feeling.
Just a couple of days later I was walking along a diagonal sidewalk toward where in those days the sidewalks met in a big X, right about where the Harold B. Lee Library annex is now. I was walking along toward that X when the national anthem began playing, so I stopped. When it finished playing, I walked along the sidewalk and came to where the sidewalks crossed in an X. I ran into Sue right there in the middle of the X. It was on a Wednesday afternoon, and there were thousands of students in that area. And I ran into my eternal companion in the center of the X! I didn’t say this to the Lord, but I got it.
Just a few weeks ago we celebrated our forty-fifth anniversary. She is the love of my life. I came here to find her because she wasn’t in Boston. She was here. I am so grateful. And whenever I walk on this campus I feel the same way.
So I love to come here. And I love you. The Lord has blessed me with the gift of love for you. I believe He wants me in my responsibilities now to see you and love you the way He sees you and loves you.
I pray that you will feel that love today. I also pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us as we consider together the implications of a very simple message. This message has come to me personally, but I feel that I should share it with you.
The Need to Be Better
Here it is: Whatever level of spirituality we now enjoy in our lives; whatever degree of faith in Jesus Christ we now have; whatever strength of commitment and consecration; whatever degree of obedience, hope, or charity is ours; and whatever level of professional skill or ability we have obtained, it will not be sufficient for the work that lies ahead.
I believe this message fits into a beautiful pattern the Lord has established in the Restoration, beginning with His appearance with His Father to Joseph Smith in 1820. Line upon line, precept upon precept, and step by step, Jesus Christ has built up His Church and His people. He has said:
For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness.1

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a joy to be with you this morning. There is something about the beginning of a new school year that brings hope and optimism. Perhaps it is the chance to start out fresh—no matter how challenging the prior semester has been. Perhaps it is the promise that fall, with its crisp air and changing leaves—and, for me, football season—will soon arrive. Hopefully for all of us it is the thrill you feel in being involved in the intellect-expanding, soul-­refining, celestializing endeavor in which we are all engaged.
This last year has brought many successes and a few challenges. Since we last met in this setting, more than 7,700 of our students graduated and moved on to the next phase of their lifelong learning process. During their stay here, many accomplished great things, ranging from receiving a Truman Scholarship to temple marriage. Others excelled as they represented the university in various settings.
 The BYU Ballroom Dance Company won the Blackpool competition in modern formation, a feat they have accomplished every time since 1989 that their three-year cycle has taken them back to England. They also took first place in Latin American formation—another repeat championship. The men’s volleyball team, the men’s rugby team, and the women’s rugby team all competed in their respective national championship games, all on the same day. Hopefully you can identify and celebrate other successes in your areas. They are evident all around us.
Improvements have also been made to our campus infrastructure. We completed fund-raising for the new Engineering Building, and construction is now underway. Expansion of the Harman Building has begun, in large part to expand the online learning environment here on campus, and the new Marriott Center Annex, housing our men’s and women’s basketball teams, is nearing completion. My thanks to all those involved in these and numerous other projects on campus.
We have also faced challenges in this past year—challenges that give us opportunities to improve. As I am sure you are all aware, we are examining in depth the reporting process for our students and other aspects of the way we handle sexual assault cases. It causes us deep sorrow to know that members of our community would be victimized in such a devastating way. We are anxious to help them.
A group of faculty and administrators have worked tirelessly during the summer to help us know how best to do that. We anticipate that this fall the advisory council will present their recommendations to the President’s Council. We will then address the topic with the campus community more in depth. In the meantime, let me emphasize that the top priority in this extensive effort is the safety and well-being of our students, especially those who have been the victims of sexual assault. Efforts will continue until sexual assault is eliminated from our campus environment.
