  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="How does the month of January affect you? Gone are the carols, the wrapping paper, and the lights. Put away carefully are the wreaths, garlands, and bows. Out on the curbside sits the dry tree, which has left a trail of pine needles down the driveway. Packed predictably on our hips and thighs are the holiday treats served lovingly by grandmas, neighbors, and friends.

Has your “one-horse open sleigh” turned into a pumpkin with the first stroke of January? Has your “Silent night . . . all is calm, all is bright,” gone to “study all night; what is wrong? I have no life?”

I would like to introduce my topic today with a bit of trivia. Did you know that the month of January was named after the Roman god Janus, who had two faces: one to look into the past and one to look into the future?

As we make our New Year’s resolutions, we do so like Janus with an eye on the future but also with a look back on past mistakes as well as past successes. It seems we must do this in order to put our lives into perspective and decide how we can improve and refine ourselves.

As we reflect on our past, get a grasp on the present, and look to the future, it is important that we see clear images of where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going. Think how difficult that would be if the gospel of Jesus Christ were not a part of our lives. We would be able to see only the here and now, and our image of the present would be distorted by a lack of perspective. It is about seeing clear images with an eternal perspective that I would like to speak today.

When we see things up too close without looking at the entire picture, we lose perspective. Have you ever been to an art museum and viewed a painting from a few inches away, and then stepped back to see the grandeur of the artist’s intent? (I’ve always wondered how great artists could catch the vision of the finished product only a paintbrush away.)

Have you ever looked at your face so close in a mirror that a zit appeared to be the size of a strawberry? Not long ago, our youngest daughter, Christie, was getting ready for a party when I heard this horrible sound. It was somewhere between a scream and a groan. Fearing she had burned herself with the curling iron that had been left on for an hour (with five daughters, Rex has spent the past fifteen years running around our house unplugging curling irons—that’s how he trained for marathons), I rushed into her bathroom. There she sat on the counter with her feet in the sink and her face two inches away from the mirror.

“Gross,” she kept repeating. “Gross! I am so ugly, I can’t believe I would even go out of this house!” I stepped closer to see what was so gross, but it escaped me.

“Look at this,” she said, turning her face toward me. “Did you ever see anything so gross?”

“What? Where?” was my honest response. “You look wonderful to me!”

“Oh, you’re just saying that because you’re my mother. If you can’t see this red thing on my face then you are blind. It makes me look so ugly.”

As she turned into the light, I finally saw the object of her distress, but just barely. It was a tiny bit pink and vaguely visible. In no way did it render her whole person ugly. I stood there by her side, the two of us looking at her reflection in the mirror. She saw only one thing, yet I could see so much more. I saw a beautiful young girl and could envision her beyond the beginning of her teens and see what she would become. She could see only the moment of anguish. I could see the loving heart and caring spirit. She could see only the blemish, a magnification of what was wrong, and it became the whole of her. No amount of talking on my part could convince her that my image of her was the clear one.

I thought to myself, “How can she not see who she really is? How can she complain when she has been given so much? How can one little blemish diminish her image of herself? Why can’t she see the total picture of who she is and who she can be?”

And then I had a humbling thought. Aren’t we all at times a little like Christie? How often do we fail to see things in their eternal perspective? How often do we let one flaw, one mistake, one bad grade, one disappointment, or even many disappointments loom so large before our eyes that we fail to see circumstances as they really are?

I can remember the first English paper I ever wrote when I was a freshman on this campus. It came back with red marks all over it—suggestions, corrections, sentences obliterated. I had thought I was a good student, that English was one of my best subjects, that I was a good writer. But, no! Now, because of one paper with a bunch of red marks on it, I saw myself as a failure.

Tears rolled down my cheeks as I walked across campus, and I questioned what I was doing here. Wasn’t I being just a little like Christie? Did my Father in Heaven think I was a failure because of one English paper? Of course not. But momentarily I lost my confidence, and with it my eternal perspective. I had lost my ability to be the person Heavenly Father saw in me. When we allow this to happen, the light of Christ that is in us dims. That light is a gift to each of us. We are born with it, and by our acts on earth that light either fades or brightens.

As we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 11:

&lt;i&gt;And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.&lt;/i&gt;

Only through that light will we see clear reflections of who we and others are. Sometimes we are fooled by what the media would have us believe is perfection: gorgeous bodies, flawless skin, fashionable clothes. But this is not the way our Father in Heaven looks at us. We are told that “the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (l Samuel 16:7). He uses a measuring stick of eternal perfection, where what really counts is how much we illuminate with the light of Christ.

Whenever I think of letting the light of Christ shine through us, I think of a rainbow or a prism that refracts light and displays many beautiful colors in the process. Even with the light of Christ in each of us, our lives will be as different as the colors in the rainbow. Remember, it is not possible for us in this earth life to be mirror images of Christ’s perfection. However, what we can do is allow his light to shine through us just as light shines through the atmosphere creating a rainbow—a unique piece of beauty.

Despite what the world may tell us, this light—or this beauty—does not grow brighter with cosmetics or expensive clothes. Instead, it increases with Christlike acts and living gospel principles, whether it be taking an extra few minutes to help a friend, being kind to someone less fortunate, speaking a soft word to someone who is stressed or angry, or giving up something that we want in order to make someone else’s day more joyful, comfortable, or happy.

Marion G. Romney once said, “When earth life is over and things appear in their true perspective, we shall more clearly see . . . that the fruits of the gospel are the only objectives worthy of life’s full efforts” (&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;October 1949, p. 39).

We would all like to have the ability of the two-headed Roman God Janus to look forward and backward at the same time, letting our past experiences direct our future ones. The best way—the only perfect way—this can be accomplished is by bringing the light of Christ into our lives. Only through the light of Christ that is in us and our understanding of the gospel can we see things in perspective—seeing as clearly as is possible in this life what is in the past and in the future.

I don’t know about you, but I want to see everything. I wish I knew more and could understand all things. I am impatient, and I want to see everything clearly now. Even as a child I wondered what it would be like to see my Savior. I wondered if I would know him and if he would recognize me. My brothers and sisters, through the years I have come to understand that if we let his light shine in us, we will receive “his image in [our] countenances” (Alma 5:14), and he will know us, not by our outward appearance but by the light within. He will know us because our total beings will reflect his image. And we will know him because we recognize his light in us.

I know that our Redeemer is the light of the world and that his light dwells in each of us. I bear testimony that this is true. I want his image to be on my countenance. And when I look in my mirror of life, I want to see past the blemishes. I want his light to glow so deeply inside me that I will be able to see things, as completely as possible, with an eternal perspective. It is my prayer that we will nurture the God-given light that is in us. And when we feel its glow growing dim, we will reach out to others in Christlike ways reflecting his light and glory. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>How does the month of January affect you? Gone are the carols, the wrapping paper, and the lights. Put away carefully are the wreaths, garlands, and bows. Out on the curbside sits the dry tree, which has left a trail of pine needles down the driveway. Packed predictably on our hips and thighs are the holiday treats served lovingly by grandmas, neighbors, and friends.</p>
<p>Has your “one-horse open sleigh” turned into a pumpkin with the first stroke of January? Has your “Silent night . . . all is calm, all is bright,” gone to “study all night; what is wrong? I have no life?”</p>
<p>I would like to introduce my topic today with a bit of trivia. Did you know that the month of January was named after the Roman god Janus, who had two faces: one to look into the past and one to look into the future?</p>
<p>As we make our New Year’s resolutions, we do so like Janus with an eye on the future but also with a look back on past mistakes as well as past successes. It seems we must do this in order to put our lives into perspective and decide how we can improve and refine ourselves.</p>
<p>As we reflect on our past, get a grasp on the present, and look to the future, it is important that we see clear images of where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going. Think how difficult that would be if the gospel of Jesus Christ were not a part of our lives. We would be able to see only the here and now, and our image of the present would be distorted by a lack of perspective. It is about seeing clear images with an eternal perspective that I would like to speak today.</p>
<p>When we see things up too close without looking at the entire picture, we lose perspective. Have you ever been to an art museum and viewed a painting from a few inches away, and then stepped back to see the grandeur of the artist’s intent? (I’ve always wondered how great artists could catch the vision of the finished product only a paintbrush away.)</p>
<p>Have you ever looked at your face so close in a mirror that a zit appeared to be the size of a strawberry? Not long ago, our youngest daughter, Christie, was getting ready for a party when I heard this horrible sound. It was somewhere between a scream and a groan. Fearing she had burned herself with the curling iron that had been left on for an hour (with five daughters, Rex has spent the past fifteen years running around our house unplugging curling irons—that’s how he trained for marathons), I rushed into her bathroom. There she sat on the counter with her feet in the sink and her face two inches away from the mirror.</p>
<p>“Gross,” she kept repeating. “Gross! I am so ugly, I can’t believe I would even go out of this house!” I stepped closer to see what was so gross, but it escaped me.</p>
<p>“Look at this,” she said, turning her face toward me. “Did you ever see anything so gross?”</p>
<p>“What? Where?” was my honest response. “You look wonderful to me!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re just saying that because you’re my mother. If you can’t see this red thing on my face then you are blind. It makes me look so ugly.”</p>
<p>As she turned into the light, I finally saw the object of her distress, but just barely. It was a tiny bit pink and vaguely visible. In no way did it render her whole person ugly. I stood there by her side, the two of us looking at her reflection in the mirror. She saw only one thing, yet I could see so much more. I saw a beautiful young girl and could envision her beyond the beginning of her teens and see what she would become. She could see only the moment of anguish. I could see the loving heart and caring spirit. She could see only the blemish, a magnification of what was wrong, and it became the whole of her. No amount of talking on my part could convince her that my image of her was the clear one.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, “How can she not see who she really is? How can she complain when she has been given so much? How can one little blemish diminish her image of herself? Why can’t she see the total picture of who she is and who she can be?”</p>
<p>And then I had a humbling thought. Aren’t we all at times a little like Christie? How often do we fail to see things in their eternal perspective? How often do we let one flaw, one mistake, one bad grade, one disappointment, or even many disappointments loom so large before our eyes that we fail to see circumstances as they really are?</p>
<p>I can remember the first English paper I ever wrote when I was a freshman on this campus. It came back with red marks all over it—suggestions, corrections, sentences obliterated. I had thought I was a good student, that English was one of my best subjects, that I was a good writer. But, no! Now, because of one paper with a bunch of red marks on it, I saw myself as a failure.</p>
<p>Tears rolled down my cheeks as I walked across campus, and I questioned what I was doing here. Wasn’t I being just a little like Christie? Did my Father in Heaven think I was a failure because of one English paper? Of course not. But momentarily I lost my confidence, and with it my eternal perspective. I had lost my ability to be the person Heavenly Father saw in me. When we allow this to happen, the light of Christ that is in us dims. That light is a gift to each of us. We are born with it, and by our acts on earth that light either fades or brightens.</p>
<p>As we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 11:</p>
<p><i>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings.</i></p>
<p>Only through that light will we see clear reflections of who we and others are. Sometimes we are fooled by what the media would have us believe is perfection: gorgeous bodies, flawless skin, fashionable clothes. But this is not the way our Father in Heaven looks at us. We are told that “the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (l Samuel 16:7). He uses a measuring stick of eternal perfection, where what really counts is how much we illuminate with the light of Christ.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of letting the light of Christ shine through us, I think of a rainbow or a prism that refracts light and displays many beautiful colors in the process. Even with the light of Christ in each of us, our lives will be as different as the colors in the rainbow. Remember, it is not possible for us in this earth life to be mirror images of Christ’s perfection. However, what we can do is allow his light to shine through us just as light shines through the atmosphere creating a rainbow—a unique piece of beauty.</p>
<p>Despite what the world may tell us, this light—or this beauty—does not grow brighter with cosmetics or expensive clothes. Instead, it increases with Christlike acts and living gospel principles, whether it be taking an extra few minutes to help a friend, being kind to someone less fortunate, speaking a soft word to someone who is stressed or angry, or giving up something that we want in order to make someone else’s day more joyful, comfortable, or happy.</p>
<p>Marion G. Romney once said, “When earth life is over and things appear in their true perspective, we shall more clearly see . . . that the fruits of the gospel are the only objectives worthy of life’s full efforts” (<i>CR, </i>October 1949, p. 39).</p>
<p>We would all like to have the ability of the two-headed Roman God Janus to look forward and backward at the same time, letting our past experiences direct our future ones. The best way—the only perfect way—this can be accomplished is by bringing the light of Christ into our lives. Only through the light of Christ that is in us and our understanding of the gospel can we see things in perspective—seeing as clearly as is possible in this life what is in the past and in the future.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I want to see everything. I wish I knew more and could understand all things. I am impatient, and I want to see everything clearly now. Even as a child I wondered what it would be like to see my Savior. I wondered if I would know him and if he would recognize me. My brothers and sisters, through the years I have come to understand that if we let his light shine in us, we will receive “his image in [our] countenances” (Alma 5:14), and he will know us, not by our outward appearance but by the light within. He will know us because our total beings will reflect his image. And we will know him because we recognize his light in us.</p>
<p>I know that our Redeemer is the light of the world and that his light dwells in each of us. I bear testimony that this is true. I want his image to be on my countenance. And when I look in my mirror of life, I want to see past the blemishes. I want his light to glow so deeply inside me that I will be able to see things, as completely as possible, with an eternal perspective. It is my prayer that we will nurture the God-given light that is in us. And when we feel its glow growing dim, we will reach out to others in Christlike ways reflecting his light and glory. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What an amazing opportunity it is to stand before you today. Never in a million years would I have ever thought that I would be right here, right now. I must admit that the first thing I thought when asked if I would be willing to speak was, “Really? Are you sure? I’m just a soccer coach!” And then I thought, “Oh, no—those new Marriott Center screens are way too big!”
It goes to show you that we never know what God has in store for us in the present or in the future. Life is a journey, and we must always embrace it—even when we are asked to do something that we thought was absolutely unimaginable. My journey truly has been different than what I would have ever foreseen when I once sat in your seat over thirty years ago. But what a blessed life and what a ride it has been.
I pray that I will be able to share a few thoughts and stories today that might inspire you to realize your significance and importance here on earth. I know that I will not necessarily tell you anything you haven’t heard before, but I hope that I might remind you of what you have always known and of what can so easily be forgotten in our demanding lives.
Follow the Light
Does your life seem too busy at times? I know mine does. We live in a world in which our lives are busier, noisier, and more stressful than ever—a time when nothing stops or even slows down. We have more responsibilities, more pressures, more expectations, and more places to be, and we spend far too much time on our smartphones. It just seems impossible sometimes to keep up with the pace.
In order to slow down the madness of life, I love to retreat into nature. We are so blessed to live at the base of majestic mountains. We can look to the west and appreciate the view of the lake, travel east and be enveloped in the canyons, or drive south and take in the magnificence and serenity of the red rock.
I am always drawn to the light in the beauty of God’s creations, in which I can find ­calmness, comfort, peace, and a deeper connection to my Heavenly Father and my Savior. Just as the sun, the moon, and the stars light the landscape of this beautiful world, the light from above provides us with direction and purpose. When I think about light and the many different meanings it has, I reflect on an experience I had last June.
For several years I have had the opportunity to participate in a team race that takes runners through some of the most beautiful scenery in the state. The event starts in Logan and winds through the Wasatch Back to finish in Park City. It is called the Ragnar Relay Series, and each team consists of two vans, with six people packed into each van. Each team spends more than thirty hours together with no sleep, not much food, and few rest spots. Each team member runs three different routes, and the whole team runs a total of more than 180 miles. What an adventure!
Last year I wasn’t quite as prepared as usual</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In considering what I might say today, my mind kept turning to what the Apostle Paul said in his first epistle to the Corinthians: “For now we see through a glass, darkly.”1 Over many years I have thought a great deal about this statement and its meaning. The word seeing is often used to describe the action of visually or mentally perceiving or discerning. It can also mean to perceive or discern spiritually, and how we see is critical in shaping who we are, the choices we make, and who we become.
Research on seeing and perception is conducted in a number of different fields. In the visual arts we spend a considerable amount of time looking at things: we frequently discuss the process of seeing and carefully work to develop our abilities to see in an artistic context. It is clear that although we may see much in common, as humans we often see in vastly different ways. To illustrate this I invite you to carefully look at four works of art. As you do, consciously consider your response.
Seeing Differently—Four Still-Life Paintings
The first work was executed in blue-black ink on paper and is entitled Six Persimmons. It was painted by the Chinese monk Mu Qi (Chi) in the thirteenth century. Mu Qi was a Zen monk who lived during the Song dynasty and worked toward a highly reduced form of brush painting. It is said that Zen Buddhism—a school of thought that highly valued meditation as an avenue for enlightenment—was the most stripped-down form of Buddhism and greatly influenced the artist’s views. This painting became famous for its skilled and minimal brushstrokes and its painterly simplicity and was considered an unprecedented artistic innovation.2
The second work is a seventeenth-century Italian baroque watercolor painting on parchment entitled A Bowl with Peaches and Plums. In the baroque period, naturalistic and highly detailed painting flourished, and still-life painting was often symbolic, teaching moral lessons. This work is by the artist Giovanna Garzoni. The fact that Garzoni was a very successful female artist made her quite unusual for her time. She was also one of the first women to focus on still-life painting.3
The third work is by the French artist Paul Cézanne. It is an oil painting entitled Ginger Pot with Pomegranate and Pears and was completed sometime around 1890. Cézanne was considered a Postimpressionist and was one of the most important painters of the second half of the nineteenth century. His brushwork, planes of color, and explorations of geometric simplicity laid the foundation for the transition from nineteenth-century artistic ideas to a new and very different twentieth-century art world.4
The fourth and final work is an oil painting entitled Still Life Portuguese. It was painted in 1917 by Robert Delaunay, a French artist who with his artist wife, Sonia, and others cofounded t</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Do you remember being afraid of the dark when you were a child? When you became frightened, you probably turned on the lights—all the lights in the house! When your parents came home later in the evening, they would ask, “Why is every light in the house on?” Then they would proceed to lecture you about the family budget and the cost of electricity.
You had learned, however, that by turning on an electric light or by lighting a candle, there was no more darkness, no more fear. You learned a simple law of nature, which is also a spiritual law: Light and darkness cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Satan and his disciples cannot tolerate the spiritual light of the gospel; they must immediately depart.
When we live the commandments, our countenance is surrounded by gospel light. With this spiritual light we no longer wander in the strange and darkened paths of the adversary, becoming lost, discouraged, depressed, and fearful. Walking in the light of the gospel, we will not lose sight of our eternal goals.
Teach me to walk in the light of his love;
Teach me to pray to my Father above;
Teach me to know of the things that are right;
Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.
[“Teach Me to Walk in the Light,” Songbook, p. 177]
Jesus taught that we should be faithful and believing children of light. “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:5). “I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness” (John 12:46).
That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day. [That perfect day is when we will be able to stand in the presence of God and endure his light.]
And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth, that you may chase darkness from among you. [D&amp;C 50:24–25]
Truth is light that dispels darkness. “Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light of the world” (D&amp;C 11:28; see 3 Nephi 9:18).
While Jesus was teaching the people, they inquired about his death and wondered if they would be left alone when he was gone from their presence in mortality. “Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you,” meaning he would soon depart mortality. “Walk while ye have the light [with you],” meaning that he was in their presence.
Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed. [John 12:35–36; emphasis added]

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, I am coming to you today in a very contrite, humble spirit as I am feeling I should address you with some matters of a more delicate nature but which, in my estimation, are of basic importance. I hope that I will be capable of expressing my feelings without being misunderstood—knowing that this can easily happen as I am not expressing myself in my native language.
Something of More Importance
Some time ago, when I was living in the mission field, the missionaries invited me to come see a couple they had been teaching for some time. The missionaries reported to me what a choice couple they were. However, they were very much afraid to make the change and the commitment of baptism. As we entered the home of this wonderful family and found ourselves in their living room, I recognized their fear and anxiety over this visit. I understood that they had been taught the gospel, that they had received all of the discussions, and that they already had a testimony that the gospel is true. I felt prompted to ask them, “What do you think the Lord expects you to do when you enter into the bond of the covenant of baptism for the forgiveness of sins?”
I remember that the woman looked at him and the man looked at her with the sweetness of two wonderful persons in their first years of marriage, and finally he said, “I think we will have to pay our tithing.” I remember that I answered, “Yes, that is true, but there is something of more importance. What do you think the Lord will expect you to do when you enter into this covenant?”
After some inquiring glances from her to him and from him to her, he said quite hesitantly, “We must give up our drinking, our coffee, and our smoking.” Again I told him, “Yes, that is true, but there is something of more importance.”
After we had discussed all the necessary requirements for baptism and I was still insisting that there was something of more importance, they became even more uneasy about what else there still was to do. I felt inspired to say to them, “I can see that you have learned to love the Lord and understand the basic principles of the covenant which you are about to make with him. Now the Lord wants you to take the Spirit, which will be given to you as his gift after baptism, and make it the greatest objective of your life—to let this Spirit be unfolded within you to its fullness of power. Thus, the Lord wants you both to love one another with an even deeper, more sensitive, caring love—a love of a new dimension that is different from the way the world knows—even to such a dimension that you will be overwhelmed by your insight, your patience, your caring, and sensitivity so that you will both be filled with a new dimension of joy and peace.”
The expressions on their faces changed from fear, anxiety, and despair to relaxed smiles of rejoicing. He reached for her hand, looked dearly into her eyes, presse</span>
