  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear brothers and sisters, do we really mean what we say when we address each other as brother and sister?

These are rather peculiar titles for many people not familiar with our Mormon culture. Names such as Brother Jim or Sister Smith are used fondly and respectfully when addressing each other to express our kinship in the family of God. Why do we use these affectionate titles?

Let me quote from the missionary guide &lt;i&gt;Preach My Gospel:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth. We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;God’s whole purpose—His work and His glory—is to enable each of us to enjoy all His blessings. He has provided a perfect plan to accomplish His purpose. We understood and accepted this plan before we came to the earth.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 48]

When I was a small boy growing up, my older brother was bigger than life to me. He was nine years older and the best player on every team he played on. He always looked out for his little brother and spent many hours teaching me the skills of various sports. Since we shared a bedroom—much to his chagrin—I oftentimes would hear him awake late at night and slip out to the backyard to lift weights to get stronger. I spent many nights peering out the window at his example of extra effort and dreamed I one day could be like him. He truly was, and still remains, a great brother. He continues to influence my life for good as my big brother.

Elder Henry B. Eyring taught: “Your responsibility is to touch people so that they will make the choices that will take them toward eternal life. And eternal life is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (“To Touch a Life with Faith,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1995, 37–38).

Perhaps one of the more thought-provoking questions asked in the scriptures is the one asked by Cain when questioned by the Lord on the whereabouts of his brother Abel: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (Genesis 4:9). Cain had slain his younger brother because God had accepted Abel’s offering and rejected his. Cain’s words have come to symbolize man’s unwillingness to accept responsibility for the welfare of his “brothers” on this earth. In our present-day situations, we would all do well, as children of our Heavenly Father, to contemplate our answer to that same question: “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

To be able to answer in the affirmative, “Yes, I am my brother’s keeper!” we must be obedient to the command given us by Jesus when He said:

&lt;i&gt;A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.&lt;/i&gt; [John 13:34–35]

Just how do we determine who our brothers and sisters are? The Apostle Paul stated on Mars Hill that God “hath made of &lt;i&gt;one blood all nations&lt;/i&gt; of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth” (Acts 17:26; emphasis added). All mankind have chosen to come to this earth in obedience to the plan of salvation and are indeed the sons and daughters of God—and thus brothers and sisters in His heavenly family.

Modern revelation further describes the familial relationship that we are granted through the Atonement of our Savior. We learn from King Benjamin of our place in the family of Christ:

&lt;i&gt;And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 5:7]

We catch a further glimpse of who Jesus considers His brothers and sisters from this exchange found in Matthew:

&lt;i&gt;While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.&lt;/i&gt; [Matthew 12:46–50]

The hoped-for result of this knowledge of our heavenly family was described by Paul in his letter to the Romans:

&lt;i&gt;Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.&lt;/i&gt; [Romans 12:9–10]

Furthermore, we are instructed in Timothy:

&lt;i&gt;Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Timothy 5:1–2]

Brothers and sisters, love one another. Serve each other. I would think that most of you here today have followed and accepted the premise of brotherhood and sisterhood as taught from the scriptures. The issue is not so much that you don’t accept a stranger as a brother or sister as much as it is you simply have not conditioned yourself to serve them. Serving those who we love and who love us—those who think like us or look like us or speak like us, or even worship like us—is good. However, we must learn to reach out to those we don’t know: to the discarded, the sick, those less fortunate, the inflicted, the lonely, and those we don’t necessarily understand.

The story of the dramatic rescue of the members of the Martin and Willie Handcart Companies—a group of our early pioneer Saints trapped and frozen on the plains—is one that inspires me today to listen for the call to action and GO! Elder Jeffrey R. Holland reminded us that being our brother’s keeper is a theme we need oft remember. Quoting from Elder Holland’s most recent general conference address:

&lt;i&gt;As surely as the rescue of those in need was the general conference theme of October 1856, so too is it the theme of this conference and last conference and the one to come next spring. . . . The needy . . . can be rescued only by those who have more and know more and can help more. And don’t worry about asking, “Where are they?” They are everywhere, on our right hand and on our left, in our neighborhoods and in the workplace, in every community and county and nation of this world. Take your team and wagon; load it with your love, your testimony, and a spiritual sack of flour; then drive in any direction. The Lord will lead you to those in need if you will but embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ.&lt;/i&gt; [“Prophets in the Land Again,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2006, 106]

President Thomas S. Monson, speaking of our call to service, stated:

&lt;i&gt;This is the service that counts, the service to which all of us have been called: the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Along your pathway of life you will observe that you are not the only traveler. There are others who need your help. There are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save.&lt;/i&gt; [“How Firm a Foundation,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2006, 68]

The Prophet Joseph Smith—oft referred to by the people of his day as Brother Joseph—was the epitome of selflessness. He reached out to strangers in many ways to assist them and bless their lives. We need not look far to find excellent examples of brotherly and sisterly love. The Lord’s chosen servants of today emulate their predecessors and shine a light on all that is good, devoting their lives to serving others.

A story is told of a man having a conversation with the Lord one day. He said, “Lord, I would like to know what heaven and hell are like.”

The Lord led the man to two doors. He opened one of the doors, and the man looked in. In the middle of the room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew, which smelled delicious and made the man’s mouth water.

The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished. They were holding spoons with very long handles that were strapped to their arms. Each found it possible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful, but because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths.

The man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering. The Lord said, “You have seen hell.”

They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one. There was the large round table with the large pot of stew that made the man’s mouth water. The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons strapped to their arms, but here the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking.

The man said, “I don’t understand!”

“It is simple,” said the Lord. “It requires but one skill. You see, they have learned to feed each other, while the greedy think only of themselves.”

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wondered why men do not treat each other like brothers and sisters. Let me quote Dr. King:

&lt;i&gt;Modern man has brought this whole world to an awe-inspiring threshold of the future. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yet . . . something basic is missing. There is a sort of poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance. The richer we have become materially, the poorer we have become morally and spiritually. We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers.&lt;/i&gt; [Speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize (11 December 1964)]

I believe Dr. King would be pleased with the response from people all over the world to our brothers and sisters in Indonesia who were suffering from the devastation of last year’s tsunami. Millions of people came to the aid of brothers and sisters they didn’t even know. They acted on the impression of loving our neighbors as ourselves (see Matthew 19:19).

Brothers and sisters, the business of making a living, raising a family, receiving an education, and any other worthy endeavor we are involved in truly tests how we answer the question “Am I my brother’s keeper?” God works miracles in the lives of His children through the Christlike service rendered by their brothers and sisters. A warm smile, a friendly greeting, a door held open, any good deed—however simple it may be—can turn a bad day into a good one.

I enjoy singing the words of a favorite Church hymn:

&lt;i&gt;Have I done any good in the world today?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Have I helped anyone in need?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If not, I have failed indeed.&lt;/i&gt;

[“Have I Done Any Good?” &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 223]

It will be a long time before I forget the special kindness expressed by my friend Verl Rasband, an older gentleman who attended my ward. Verl served well in many capacities throughout his life and still finds the time and makes the effort today to continue to make a difference in the lives of others. Verl learns the first names of many of the children in our ward and goes out of his way to greet and talk with them regularly. At first the children are surprised that an older man would even know their name. But his warm greeting makes them feel good. As a result of his kind heart and sweet spirit, all my children respect, admire, and love Brother Rasband. From his fine example my children now go out of their way to greet Verl before he can find them. His love is contagious.

It is unlikely that any of us will be honored for our service, but recognition is not the reward. Our reward is blessing lives. Loving one another is not merely a suggestion or a good recommendation. It is a commandment. When we are obedient to this command, our lives and the lives of our brothers and sisters are richly blessed. As we express our love through actions on behalf of our brothers and sisters, we set a good example to others of Christlike service.

BYU is a &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; place with &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; people moving in &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; directions. It sometimes may seem a difficult task to make a difference in the life of one of your fellow students, faculty, or staff members. I often enjoy looking for examples of good works here on campus and seeing acts of brotherly kindness. Two years ago, when I was appointed director of athletics, I was touched by the many helping hands extended to my associates and me by brothers and sisters across campus. Words of encouragement, free time spent assisting us with our plans, and other extra effort enabled us to lighten our load and ensure us a good start. As a result of their service to us, I feel a strong camaraderie and a greater desire to do more to further build up our campus.

One group of BYU students I admire—our own BYU football team—refers to each other affectionately as the Band of Brothers.

The team’s motto was inspired from the lines of Shakespeare’s play &lt;i&gt;Henry V:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For he to-day that sheds his blood with me&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Shall be my brother.&lt;/i&gt;

[William Shakespeare, &lt;i&gt;Henry V,&lt;/i&gt; act 4, scene 3, lines 60–62]

This year’s members of the BYU football team have bonded to the cause of restoring tradition, being honorable, and living by the Spirit. Skeptics were cynical concerning the rare approach of this team and their leader. How can there be enough time to prepare for game day when weekly firesides are held on the eve of each game? Rough and tumble football players will get soft focusing on things of the Spirit instead of visualizing on-field violence.

This Band of Brothers strives toward holding each other accountable for the good of the whole. Selfish motives are shelved in place of team objectives. The duty to represent not only each other but also BYU and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not just a part-time thing. When one falters, all are affected. When one succeeds, all benefit!

Coach Bronco Mendenhall and the team’s leadership council have instituted what they call the Big Brother Program. Each younger player on the team is paired up with one of the upperclassmen. Each week the “big brother” conducts an interview with his “younger brother.” They address such topics as academics, football, family, girlfriends, spirituality, and any other issue the two care to discuss. Then the big brother writes a letter to Coach Mendenhall sharing any thoughts, experiences or concerns the two might have concerning each other, the team, or their teammates. The letters are confidential—some are even sacred to Bronco. Privately, Coach Mendenhall is able to assist his boys based on their communication. What has developed within this year’s team goes way beyond what is witnessed on the field of play, as can be seen in such activities as the Band of Brothers performing a team hymn at a recent pre-game fireside in Fort Collins, Colorado, the night before the Cougars played the Colorado State Rams.

Like many of you here today, my life took further shape through my experiences as a student at BYU. Not only was I challenged physically and emotionally through athletics, but I also grew mentally and emotionally through the rigors of academics and was changed forever by the ever-present Spirit that is often expressed through many brothers and sisters on campus.

I will be eternally grateful for the wonderful example of the best teacher I ever had: Joe Wood—a man more affectionately referred to by his students as Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe taught religion and history here. When I arrived at BYU, I was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was way out of my element: in a very different culture, homesick for my family, and feeling like a fish out of water. As weeks went by during my first semester, I considered abandoning my hopes and dreams for BYU and returning to the friendly confines of home. Somehow, Uncle Joe saw something missing in me. He went out of his way to approach me after class and encourage me to stay strong. He reached out a hand of friendship, which I gladly accepted. He continued to look after me, and soon I looked forward to his class as the highlight of my day. He laughed and smiled and even shed tears of gratitude. He called his students by their first name and often shook our hand or put his arm around our shoulders. I grew to realize that he hadn’t just taken a special interest in &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; He made &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; in class feel special. The sweet spirit that radiated from Uncle Joe was what first softened my heart to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for all people on our campus like Uncle Joe who care enough to make a difference in the lives of their brothers and sisters.

I love the spirit of our BYU students. Your desire to be the best you can be—to educate and train yourselves toward becoming future family, community, and national leaders—is impressive. Many of you have made the worthy choice to pause from your college education to serve full-time missions for the Lord. Truly this is brotherly love in action: to seek out your brothers and sisters from all walks of life and from the four corners of the earth, to find all those who have been separated from the truth, and then to help lead them back to their Father in Heaven and remind them of the one great plan of salvation that leads to eternal life.

Ask yourself this question: Have I done any good in the world today?

&lt;i&gt;Then wake up and do something more&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Than dream of your mansions above.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A blessing of duty and love.&lt;/i&gt;

[“Have I Done Any Good?” &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 223]

It is my hope and prayer that we may serve our Lord by being actively engaged in blessing the lives of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; our brothers and sisters and being an instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<p>These are rather peculiar titles for many people not familiar with our Mormon culture. Names such as Brother Jim or Sister Smith are used fondly and respectfully when addressing each other to express our kinship in the family of God. Why do we use these affectionate titles?</p>
<p>Let me quote from the missionary guide <i>Preach My Gospel:</i></p>
<p><i>God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth. We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body.</i></p>
<p><i>God’s whole purpose—His work and His glory—is to enable each of us to enjoy all His blessings. He has provided a perfect plan to accomplish His purpose. We understood and accepted this plan before we came to the earth.</i> [<i>Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service </i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 48]</p>
<p>When I was a small boy growing up, my older brother was bigger than life to me. He was nine years older and the best player on every team he played on. He always looked out for his little brother and spent many hours teaching me the skills of various sports. Since we shared a bedroom—much to his chagrin—I oftentimes would hear him awake late at night and slip out to the backyard to lift weights to get stronger. I spent many nights peering out the window at his example of extra effort and dreamed I one day could be like him. He truly was, and still remains, a great brother. He continues to influence my life for good as my big brother.</p>
<p>Elder Henry B. Eyring taught: “Your responsibility is to touch people so that they will make the choices that will take them toward eternal life. And eternal life is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (“To Touch a Life with Faith,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 37–38).</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the more thought-provoking questions asked in the scriptures is the one asked by Cain when questioned by the Lord on the whereabouts of his brother Abel: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (Genesis 4:9). Cain had slain his younger brother because God had accepted Abel’s offering and rejected his. Cain’s words have come to symbolize man’s unwillingness to accept responsibility for the welfare of his “brothers” on this earth. In our present-day situations, we would all do well, as children of our Heavenly Father, to contemplate our answer to that same question: “Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>
<p>To be able to answer in the affirmative, “Yes, I am my brother’s keeper!” we must be obedient to the command given us by Jesus when He said:</p>
<p><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i></p>
<p><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i> [John 13:34–35]</p>
<p>Just how do we determine who our brothers and sisters are? The Apostle Paul stated on Mars Hill that God “hath made of <i>one blood all nations</i> of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth” (Acts 17:26; emphasis added). All mankind have chosen to come to this earth in obedience to the plan of salvation and are indeed the sons and daughters of God—and thus brothers and sisters in His heavenly family.</p>
<p>Modern revelation further describes the familial relationship that we are granted through the Atonement of our Savior. We learn from King Benjamin of our place in the family of Christ:</p>
<p><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i> [Mosiah 5:7]</p>
<p>We catch a further glimpse of who Jesus considers His brothers and sisters from this exchange found in Matthew:</p>
<p><i>While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</i></p>
<p><i>Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</i></p>
<p><i>But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</i></p>
<p><i>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</i></p>
<p><i>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</i> [Matthew 12:46–50]</p>
<p>The hoped-for result of this knowledge of our heavenly family was described by Paul in his letter to the Romans:</p>
<p><i>Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</i></p>
<p><i>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.</i> [Romans 12:9–10]</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are instructed in Timothy:</p>
<p><i>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</i></p>
<p><i>The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</i> [1 Timothy 5:1–2]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, love one another. Serve each other. I would think that most of you here today have followed and accepted the premise of brotherhood and sisterhood as taught from the scriptures. The issue is not so much that you don’t accept a stranger as a brother or sister as much as it is you simply have not conditioned yourself to serve them. Serving those who we love and who love us—those who think like us or look like us or speak like us, or even worship like us—is good. However, we must learn to reach out to those we don’t know: to the discarded, the sick, those less fortunate, the inflicted, the lonely, and those we don’t necessarily understand.</p>
<p>The story of the dramatic rescue of the members of the Martin and Willie Handcart Companies—a group of our early pioneer Saints trapped and frozen on the plains—is one that inspires me today to listen for the call to action and GO! Elder Jeffrey R. Holland reminded us that being our brother’s keeper is a theme we need oft remember. Quoting from Elder Holland’s most recent general conference address:</p>
<p><i>As surely as the rescue of those in need was the general conference theme of October 1856, so too is it the theme of this conference and last conference and the one to come next spring. . . . The needy . . . can be rescued only by those who have more and know more and can help more. And don’t worry about asking, “Where are they?” They are everywhere, on our right hand and on our left, in our neighborhoods and in the workplace, in every community and county and nation of this world. Take your team and wagon; load it with your love, your testimony, and a spiritual sack of flour; then drive in any direction. The Lord will lead you to those in need if you will but embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i> [“Prophets in the Land Again,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 106]</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson, speaking of our call to service, stated:</p>
<p><i>This is the service that counts, the service to which all of us have been called: the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i></p>
<p><i>Along your pathway of life you will observe that you are not the only traveler. There are others who need your help. There are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save.</i> [“How Firm a Foundation,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 68]</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith—oft referred to by the people of his day as Brother Joseph—was the epitome of selflessness. He reached out to strangers in many ways to assist them and bless their lives. We need not look far to find excellent examples of brotherly and sisterly love. The Lord’s chosen servants of today emulate their predecessors and shine a light on all that is good, devoting their lives to serving others.</p>
<p>A story is told of a man having a conversation with the Lord one day. He said, “Lord, I would like to know what heaven and hell are like.”</p>
<p>The Lord led the man to two doors. He opened one of the doors, and the man looked in. In the middle of the room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew, which smelled delicious and made the man’s mouth water.</p>
<p>The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished. They were holding spoons with very long handles that were strapped to their arms. Each found it possible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful, but because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths.</p>
<p>The man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering. The Lord said, “You have seen hell.”</p>
<p>They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one. There was the large round table with the large pot of stew that made the man’s mouth water. The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons strapped to their arms, but here the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking.</p>
<p>The man said, “I don’t understand!”</p>
<p>“It is simple,” said the Lord. “It requires but one skill. You see, they have learned to feed each other, while the greedy think only of themselves.”</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wondered why men do not treat each other like brothers and sisters. Let me quote Dr. King:</p>
<p><i>Modern man has brought this whole world to an awe-inspiring threshold of the future. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Yet . . . something basic is missing. There is a sort of poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance. The richer we have become materially, the poorer we have become morally and spiritually. We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers.</i> [Speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize (11 December 1964)]</p>
<p>I believe Dr. King would be pleased with the response from people all over the world to our brothers and sisters in Indonesia who were suffering from the devastation of last year’s tsunami. Millions of people came to the aid of brothers and sisters they didn’t even know. They acted on the impression of loving our neighbors as ourselves (see Matthew 19:19).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the business of making a living, raising a family, receiving an education, and any other worthy endeavor we are involved in truly tests how we answer the question “Am I my brother’s keeper?” God works miracles in the lives of His children through the Christlike service rendered by their brothers and sisters. A warm smile, a friendly greeting, a door held open, any good deed—however simple it may be—can turn a bad day into a good one.</p>
<p>I enjoy singing the words of a favorite Church hymn:</p>
<p><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i></p>
<p><i>Have I helped anyone in need?</i></p>
<p><i>Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?</i></p>
<p><i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i></p>
<p>[“Have I Done Any Good?” <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 223]</p>
<p>It will be a long time before I forget the special kindness expressed by my friend Verl Rasband, an older gentleman who attended my ward. Verl served well in many capacities throughout his life and still finds the time and makes the effort today to continue to make a difference in the lives of others. Verl learns the first names of many of the children in our ward and goes out of his way to greet and talk with them regularly. At first the children are surprised that an older man would even know their name. But his warm greeting makes them feel good. As a result of his kind heart and sweet spirit, all my children respect, admire, and love Brother Rasband. From his fine example my children now go out of their way to greet Verl before he can find them. His love is contagious.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that any of us will be honored for our service, but recognition is not the reward. Our reward is blessing lives. Loving one another is not merely a suggestion or a good recommendation. It is a commandment. When we are obedient to this command, our lives and the lives of our brothers and sisters are richly blessed. As we express our love through actions on behalf of our brothers and sisters, we set a good example to others of Christlike service.</p>
<p>BYU is a <i>big</i> place with <i>many</i> people moving in <i>all</i> directions. It sometimes may seem a difficult task to make a difference in the life of one of your fellow students, faculty, or staff members. I often enjoy looking for examples of good works here on campus and seeing acts of brotherly kindness. Two years ago, when I was appointed director of athletics, I was touched by the many helping hands extended to my associates and me by brothers and sisters across campus. Words of encouragement, free time spent assisting us with our plans, and other extra effort enabled us to lighten our load and ensure us a good start. As a result of their service to us, I feel a strong camaraderie and a greater desire to do more to further build up our campus.</p>
<p>One group of BYU students I admire—our own BYU football team—refers to each other affectionately as the Band of Brothers.</p>
<p>The team’s motto was inspired from the lines of Shakespeare’s play <i>Henry V:</i></p>
<p><i>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</i></p>
<p><i>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</i></p>
<p><i>Shall be my brother.</i></p>
<p>[William Shakespeare, <i>Henry V,</i> act 4, scene 3, lines 60–62]</p>
<p>This year’s members of the BYU football team have bonded to the cause of restoring tradition, being honorable, and living by the Spirit. Skeptics were cynical concerning the rare approach of this team and their leader. How can there be enough time to prepare for game day when weekly firesides are held on the eve of each game? Rough and tumble football players will get soft focusing on things of the Spirit instead of visualizing on-field violence.</p>
<p>This Band of Brothers strives toward holding each other accountable for the good of the whole. Selfish motives are shelved in place of team objectives. The duty to represent not only each other but also BYU and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not just a part-time thing. When one falters, all are affected. When one succeeds, all benefit!</p>
<p>Coach Bronco Mendenhall and the team’s leadership council have instituted what they call the Big Brother Program. Each younger player on the team is paired up with one of the upperclassmen. Each week the “big brother” conducts an interview with his “younger brother.” They address such topics as academics, football, family, girlfriends, spirituality, and any other issue the two care to discuss. Then the big brother writes a letter to Coach Mendenhall sharing any thoughts, experiences or concerns the two might have concerning each other, the team, or their teammates. The letters are confidential—some are even sacred to Bronco. Privately, Coach Mendenhall is able to assist his boys based on their communication. What has developed within this year’s team goes way beyond what is witnessed on the field of play, as can be seen in such activities as the Band of Brothers performing a team hymn at a recent pre-game fireside in Fort Collins, Colorado, the night before the Cougars played the Colorado State Rams.</p>
<p>Like many of you here today, my life took further shape through my experiences as a student at BYU. Not only was I challenged physically and emotionally through athletics, but I also grew mentally and emotionally through the rigors of academics and was changed forever by the ever-present Spirit that is often expressed through many brothers and sisters on campus.</p>
<p>I will be eternally grateful for the wonderful example of the best teacher I ever had: Joe Wood—a man more affectionately referred to by his students as Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe taught religion and history here. When I arrived at BYU, I was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was way out of my element: in a very different culture, homesick for my family, and feeling like a fish out of water. As weeks went by during my first semester, I considered abandoning my hopes and dreams for BYU and returning to the friendly confines of home. Somehow, Uncle Joe saw something missing in me. He went out of his way to approach me after class and encourage me to stay strong. He reached out a hand of friendship, which I gladly accepted. He continued to look after me, and soon I looked forward to his class as the highlight of my day. He laughed and smiled and even shed tears of gratitude. He called his students by their first name and often shook our hand or put his arm around our shoulders. I grew to realize that he hadn’t just taken a special interest in <i>me.</i> He made <i>everyone</i> in class feel special. The sweet spirit that radiated from Uncle Joe was what first softened my heart to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for all people on our campus like Uncle Joe who care enough to make a difference in the lives of their brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I love the spirit of our BYU students. Your desire to be the best you can be—to educate and train yourselves toward becoming future family, community, and national leaders—is impressive. Many of you have made the worthy choice to pause from your college education to serve full-time missions for the Lord. Truly this is brotherly love in action: to seek out your brothers and sisters from all walks of life and from the four corners of the earth, to find all those who have been separated from the truth, and then to help lead them back to their Father in Heaven and remind them of the one great plan of salvation that leads to eternal life.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this question: Have I done any good in the world today?</p>
<p><i>Then wake up and do something more</i></p>
<p><i>Than dream of your mansions above.</i></p>
<p><i>Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,</i></p>
<p><i>A blessing of duty and love.</i></p>
<p>[“Have I Done Any Good?” <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 223]</p>
<p>It is my hope and prayer that we may serve our Lord by being actively engaged in blessing the lives of <i>all</i> our brothers and sisters and being an instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good afternoon, honored trustees, distinguished guests, family, friends, and, most important, my fellow BYU graduating class of 2017! It is truly an honor to share this day with you all.
Attending BYU has been a privilege and has taught us many practical lessons that will guide us in the coming years. One such lesson is to never give up, which we learned from our daily ascent up the Richards Building stairs or perhaps from watching the City of Provo as it meticulously paves—and repaves—every street in town. Another lesson we have learned is to obey with exactness, which the BYU parking police have so gently taught us over the years. Finally, taking classes in the winding Jesse Knight Building has prepared us to navigate our way through the ambiguous, multi­dimensional parts of our lives.
Above all, our time at BYU has taught us to lift and serve others. I witnessed one such act of service this past September when I flew to Cozumel, Mexico, as a member of Team USA to compete in the ITU Triathlon Age-Group World Championships. While I was there, all three medalists from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games competed for the $30,000 grand prize in the men’s elite category. Two of the triathletes, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, were brothers from Great Britain who had won the gold and silver medals in the triathlon at the 2016 Olympics.
In Cozumel, when the competitors neared the end of the grueling, nearly two-hour race, Jonathan Brownlee held a comfortable lead with his brother, Alistair, trailing him and Henri Schoeman from South Africa close behind. Video footage of the race shows that with 500 meters to go until the finish line, just as the crowd erupted in applause as Jonathan rounded the final corner, the heat began to take its toll upon Jonathan’s body. All of a sudden Jonathan’s pace slowed to a stumble, and he collapsed onto a volunteer standing by the sidelines. There was an audible gasp among the spectators.1
When Alistair rounded the final corner, he saw his dangerously dehydrated younger brother unable to finish the race. Without hesitation Alistair ran toward Jonny, threw his dazed brother’s arm around his neck, and half-carried him as they ran the last 500 meters side by side. Alistair’s deviation cost him a chance at first place, allowing Schoeman to overtake the two and be first to break the tape.
As the brothers approached the finish line, Alistair pushed Jonny across ahead of him, earning them third and second places, respectively.
Alistair was half a kilometer from winning gold as a world champion. Yet rather than race to the end to claim victory for himself, he slowed, picked up his brother, and enabled Jonny to do something he could not do for himself: finish the race.
Reporters swarmed Alistair, incredulous at his noble sacrifice. To their queries he simply replied, “Mum wouldn’t have been happy if I’d left Jonny behind.”2
Just as Al</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You might recall in the beloved Dr. Seuss children’s book Horton Hears a Who! how Horton, who was an elephant, had a chance encounter with a speck of dust, from whence a voice, barely audible, called out for help. Horton recognized that the voice was coming from the speck of dust and proceeded to do all he could to protect and defend this colony of Whos, who were “too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes.”
Horton perceived that someone was in distress and realized that he could help. Instead of discounting his newly discovered friends, and amidst scoffs and scorn from others, he did all he could to give aid. He had a clear understanding of his ability to rescue and protect the Who colony. Through his actions he demonstrated his ability to give aid, share his light, and serve. As Horton exclaimed, “A person’s a person, no matter how small.”
Being Grateful
Having just celebrated Thanksgiving this past week, and as we transition from November into the month of December and celebrate the birth of our beloved Savior, it seems particularly natural that gratitude has taken center stage in our minds and in our hearts—as it should. No matter how humble and meager our circumstances, we each have so much to be grateful for.
President Thomas S. Monson said of gratitude:
To express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven. [“The Divine Gift of Gratitude,” Ensign, November 2010]
He also said:
We can lift ourselves and others as well when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude. [“Divine Gift”]
Gratitude is an expression of our faith. Negativity most certainly breeds despair, depression, lack of enthusiasm, and critical analysis of that which is most likely not our right to criticize or judge.
Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, in a devotional address on gratitude given at BYU, said:
Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make ­others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.
. . . Gratitude is a commandment of the Father. [“Live in Thanksgiving Daily,” BYU devotional address, 31 October 2000]
Doctrine and Covenants 59:7 reads, “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.”
While it may be more challenging to feel grateful when we are in the throes of trials and disappointments, those are the very times when we need to stop, take a look around, and count and list our blessings one by one. It has not been surprising to me throughout my life how</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, brothers and sisters, for taking time from your busy schedules to be here today. From years of personal experience I know the demands and pressures of attending a large university. How grateful I am that you would step away from your studies or other responsibilities to participate in this devotional. Let me also thank those who provided me with this opportunity to speak.
My wife, Tina, and I returned from Jerusalem in mid-August, after a three-year assignment at BYU’s Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. We were blessed to have been in a unique university facility, where we worked closely with administrators, faculty members, staff, volunteer couples, and hundreds of students in a way rarely afforded most people. Let me also thank my lifelong and eternal companion for her constant support in what has been a very intense and very rewarding three years. Her sacrifices were many and her influence on others immense.
Life is often filled with surprises. While I ­recognize the need we all have to set goals and to have lifelong plans in place, we often find ourselves taking detours. Some of these can be scenic and short lived. Others take us down unforeseen paths. I suppose my speaking to you today is one of those shorter detours.
Let me explain: After three years in the Holy Land, my wife and I decided a change of pace was in order when we returned to Utah. Instead of me going back to my office right away, we would spend time with family, find a home, buy a car or two (we sold our home and cars before moving to Jerusalem), and arrange for a trip to Florida to visit Magnolia, our nine-month-old grand­daughter, whom I have never met in person. It was a good plan.
Our first week back could not have gone better. We retreated to my in-laws’ cabin for some welcome family time, they loaned us a car so that we could get around, and our oldest daughter and her husband graciously took us into their home. Life was good!
Then it happened: two weeks after being back, I received an unexpected invitation to speak today—clearly a deviation from the plan, a few ripples on the calm waters of life. In between finding cars (we have), a home (we closed on it last Friday), and spending time with family, I have quietly been slipping into my office on campus to prepare for this wonderful opportunity. I moved the piles of mail that had accumulated during my absence to one side of my desk and set to work, having determined to say something about the Holy Land.
My first exposure to Jerusalem was in 1984, long before most of you were born. Sister Whitchurch and I had spent a couple of years saving money so that we could participate on a three-week Lands of the Scriptures Workshop offered through LDS Seminaries and Institutes. Our travels took us to Italy, Egypt, and many places throughout the Holy Land. From the minute the plane touched down on the tarmac at the Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Avi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a preface to my remarks today, I wish to declare my faith and testimony. I know that there is a God in heaven. He is our Heavenly Father, and He loves all of His children. He has revealed Himself to the world in these the latter days, and prophets walk the earth today as they did anciently.
God loved us, so he sent his Son,
Christ Jesus, the atoning One,
To show us by the path he trod
The one and only way to God.
[“God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son,” Hymns, 2002, no. 187]
I rejoice with you today in this good news and in this truth.
“Lonely in the Midst of a Million”
During the past several years my wife, Carol, and I have been fortunate to live with you here in “Happy Valley.” I consider this a great blessing for us and our family. But I have discovered that even in Happy Valley there are some among us who are not happy and who yearn for recognition and friendship. I find this odd because we live in an environment of relative tranquility and abundance. During an earlier era of peace and plenty described in the Book of Mormon, it was noted: “And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy” (Helaman 6:3). As we fellowship or befriend others, we can also rejoice with them and have great joy.
I have seen this outcome in many of your lives, but not all. There are lonely people among us, and today I share your concern for such souls. Perhaps you are among the lonely. Surely some of those within your reach sense the emptiness of feeling alone in the world. Moroni had such feelings when he wrote, “I am alone . . . , and I have not friends” (Mormon 8:5). But his world was devoid of Saints. In Provo we are surrounded!
In 1867 Mark Twain visited New York City and reported the following: “[New York] is a splendid desert—a domed and steepled solitude, where the stranger is lonely in the midst of a million of his race” (“Letter from ‘Mark Twain,’” San Francisco Daily Alta California, 11 August 1867, 1). How sad that lonely souls walked the same streets as thousands of other lonely persons—their potential friends. This is contrary to the way God would have us live. He desires that we be “no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens” (Ephesians 2:19).
Today there are still lonely people in New York City as well as throughout the world. Listen to a sampling of their voices:
“I always feel lonely and have no friends.”
“I’m not important to anyone. I’m forgettable. I’m boring.”
“I am so lonely. . . . Please just talk to me.” [“I Am Lonely,” experienceproject.com]
Or consider the words of a woman who recently visited a beautiful park. Excited to make new friends that day, she noted:
I passed at least 20 adults, some with children, some with dogs on leashes. The dogs a</span>
