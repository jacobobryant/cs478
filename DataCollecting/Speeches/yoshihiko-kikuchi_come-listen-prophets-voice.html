  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will guide me so that I can say the things that I have in my mind and heart. It is indeed a great privilege for me to stand before you today in this great institution built upon the foundation of the true restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and dedicated to the propagation of knowledge. I consider it an honor to speak to you especially, the Lord’s elite, the leaders of the future and the future leaders of the world.

Today I would like to relate the stories of two great leaders who showed faith and courage in obeying the voice of the Lord. And then, I would like to issue an invitation to each of you to listen to the voice of the prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, the mouthpiece for the Lord, and to obey his voice as he has directed us and continues to direct us to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nephi’s Leadership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The first story comes from the Book of Mormon. Lehi’s and Ishmael’s families had left Jerusalem and had been sojourning in the wilderness and they “did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness” (1 Nephi 17:1). The scriptures tell us that “notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all” (1 Nephi 17:6).

Each of you sisters here today, suppose that you are Nephi’s wife and you brethren that you are Nephi. You have left Jerusalem and have been sojourning in the wilderness for the space of many days, months, and years, even eight years. “Our women did bear children in the wilderness” (1 Nephi 17:1). Without sufficient sanitary supplies, water, medications, and other necessary aids, many children were born.

Not only that, but while they were in the wilderness they “did live upon raw meat” (1 Nephi 17:2). Can you imagine saying to your daughter, “Sarah, here is your dinner of raw meat”; or to your son, “Matthew, here is some raw meat for your dinner tonight”?

Can you imagine the sufferings and afflictions that you are facing in the wilderness?

But the scripture tells us that “so great were the blessings of the Lord upon” them that they “began to bear their journeyings without murmurings” (1 Nephi 17:2).

And because of their great faith in following the commandments given by the Lord, he said unto them:

&lt;i&gt;I will make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:12–13]

The prophet Nephi said that—

&lt;i&gt;if . . .the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:3]

When they finally reached the seashore, of course, they “were exceedingly rejoiced,” and they called the sea Irreantum, and they called the place “Bountiful, because of its much fruit and honey” (1 Nephi 17:5).

They finally thought that they were settled there, but—

&lt;i&gt;it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:7–8]

Brothers and sisters, I feel very strongly that we do have similar challenges—or invitations—given by the Lord to us today as a Church, as individuals, through President Kimball to share the gospel with all the world as well as with our neighbors.

Nephi could have said to the Lord, “Send me back to Jerusalem where I can find many hands to help me, tools to use, and much wood with which to construct a big ship.” Without saws, hammers, nails, lumber—all he had was a broken bow—instead of responding negatively, he sought to obey the Lord’s will, saying:

&lt;i&gt;Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:9]

Of course the Lord revealed his will:

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:10]

And Nephi made a bellows with which to blow the fire, and he made tools from the ore which he melted out of the rock. But the prophet Nephi had his greatest opposition from his older brothers, as you know.

&lt;i&gt;And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:17]

They continued murmuring against him:

&lt;i&gt;And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:20]

&lt;i&gt;And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:18]

But Nephi, as you know, replied to them:

&lt;i&gt;Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel, would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage?. . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither and they passed through on dry ground. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . The Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, who were the armies of Pharaoh.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:23–24, 26–27]

And so Nephi obeyed the Lord, built the ship, and carried his people to the promised land—in spite of the opposition of his brothers and the difficulties he encountered.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enoch’s Leadership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I want to relate another story. In the book of Moses, chapter 7, we read:

&lt;i&gt;And the Lord said unto me: Go to this people, and say unto them—Repent, lest I come out and smite them with a curse, and they die.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he gave unto me a commandment that I should baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, which is full of grace and truth, and of the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that Enoch continued to call upon all the people, save it were the people of Canaan, to repent;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And so great was the faith of Enoch, that he led the people of God, . . .and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The fear of the Lord was upon all nations, so great was the glory of the Lord, which was upon his people. And the Lord blessed the land, and they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them [spiritually or physically].&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Enoch continued his preaching in righteousness unto the people of God. And it came to pass in his days, that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 7:10–13, 17–19]

Oh, what great faith Enoch had! Not only was Enoch’s faith great, but the people of Enoch were also very humble themselves. “They were of one heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness.” Therefore, there were no spiritually and physically poor among them.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Prophet’s Leadership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, brothers and sisters, the Lord has commanded us in this day, through our living prophet, to teach the gospel to all the people, to go into all the world, and to “baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.”

In one of our Church hymns we sing:

&lt;i&gt;Come, listen to a prophet’s voice,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And hear the word of God,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And in the way of truth rejoice,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And sing for joy aloud;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We’ve found the way the prophets went,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who lived in days of yore;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Another prophet now is sent&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This knowledge to restore.&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Hymns&lt;/i&gt;, no. 46]

What strength we add to our testimonies as we see the Lord’s guiding hand in his great church and in the preparation of his prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball.

I say to all of you today,

&lt;i&gt;Come, listen to a prophet’s voice, . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For God has shown his face [again]. . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Savior to his people saith,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Let all my words obey.”&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Hymns&lt;/i&gt;, no. 46]

“Let all my words obey.” They—

&lt;i&gt;who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who spake as they were inspired by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of him in all things, should have eternal life.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 20:26]

President Kimball, the living prophet, teaches us many things, such as:

The sacred mission of Jesus Christ
The purpose of life
Eternal marriage and how to have a truly happy married life
Family influences
How to have a full and abundant life
Family preparedness, and
How to fortify our homes against the evils of the world.

He teaches us:

Faith
Forgiveness
Repentance
Obedience
Cleanliness
Reverence
Righteous living
To follow the commandments of the Lord
To honor the Sabbath
The meaning of the sacrament
Truth
Salvation
The importance of:
Children
Scripture study
Genealogy
Temple work
Keeping a journal
Honoring the priesthood
Priesthood responsibilities
The Relief Society organization
Welfare services
Loving one another
Service
Labor
Gardening
Filling Church assignments, and so on.

He teaches us about our most important personal Liahona. And the list goes on and on.

Oh, how I believe the words of Elder Thomas S. Monson, who said:

&lt;i&gt;I believe the Church has never had a person more oriented toward spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ than President Spencer W. Kimball. This has been true throughout his entire life. . . .He truly has the missionary spirit. The impact of his dynamics as a missionary-oriented person, his long experience, and the call through him as the Lord’s Prophet, Seer, and Revelator have set in motion factors which have resulted in one of the greatest upsurges in missionary work that we have ever seen.&lt;/i&gt; [“Status Report on Missionary Work,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign&lt;/i&gt;, October 1977, p. 8]

In order for all of us to be prepared in righteousness to come and dwell with the Lord in a city of holiness, we must follow the prophet’s voice. Let us heed President Kimball’s example and do our part in the missionary cause.

Regarding member missionary work, President Kimball recently said that it is—

&lt;i&gt;not simply left to our discretion and pleasure. Every man and woman should return home from this conference with a determination that they will take the gospel to their relatives and their families. If they do not, they must consider that they are not in the total favor of their Heavenly Father, because he commanded us to do so!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To some extent we have been bypassing our neighbors. There are millions of great, wonderful Protestants, Catholics, and others, and they want it just the same. They may not know what they want, but they want it just the same. And you and I only can give it to them. The gospel is without price.&lt;/i&gt; [Auckland, New Zealand, Area Conference, 1980]

President Kimball further stated:

&lt;i&gt;One of the highest forms of Christian service is to share the gospel because with its acceptance come so many other blessings. There is a special accountability to receive the oracles of God, the authoritative counsel from God’s oracles.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And all they who receive the oracles of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation, thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains descend upon their house&lt;/i&gt; (D&amp;amp;C 90:5).

And he continued:

&lt;i&gt;I am concerned with all that has been written and all that has been said. Many of our people are still hard of hearing and seemingly unwilling to make the effort to proselyte their neighbors. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We are busy people, but we must remember a heavy responsibility has been placed upon us. We must not expect the way to be easy. We must not expect to grow without some obstacles.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We must remember what a development comes to us as we teach (share) the gospel. Perhaps almost more comes to us than to them. We know, of course, there are disappointments and many people will not accept.&lt;/i&gt; [Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976, p. 4]

Brothers and sisters, it is our great need, great desire, great dream, and great obsession to bring this everlasting light, which is the gospel of the Lord, to the people of the world, this

&lt;i&gt;candle of understanding to light the way out of obscurity and darkness. Our message is to bring light into the world, and our charge to convert the people of the world to accept the truth.&lt;/i&gt; [Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976, p. 1]

On 3 April 1975, President Kimball charged the members of the Church with the following:

&lt;i&gt;Members must be finders. . . . Members should shoulder this responsibility. Every member knows nonmembers he or she can refer to the missionaries. Every father, mother, and youth in this Church should share the gospel by giving a Book of Mormon by telling the account of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or by inviting our acquaintances to a special meeting.&lt;/i&gt; [Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Missionary Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, brothers and sisters, may I just share with you a wonderful and beautiful story. Brother Isogai is 17 years old, and right before I left for this conference trip to Salt Lake, he passed on to me his conversion story, which I want to share with you today.

&lt;i&gt;My family consists of three members. We are now living in our grandparents’ home because two years ago my parents got divorced. Since then our grandfather and my mother started working to support us. Some time in October 1979, I met the missionaries on the street near Shibuya station. I studied and I was baptized, and I became inactive following my baptism.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Since my family was not stable, I was not happy, and I wondered about my future, though I was baptized—about my life, about my family. I wondered, I wondered, I wondered every day. And one day I wandered through Shibuya again. I was feeling depressed. With the feeling of depression and emptiness in my heart, I was walking toward a church without conscious direction. While there, I attended a beautiful baptism service. I was very impressed and inspired by it. I decided to come back to the Church, which I did.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I learned of the importance of the missionary work, and I helped the missionaries, and I did this particularly almost every day. I went to the street with the missionaries. And I contacted many people. One day I had been praying, and I received a strong feeling that I should teach my own family. I had baptized seven of my friends within two months. So I started to introduce the gospel to my family. First, I thought I should introduce it to my mother. My mother has many friends, and she was attending another Christian church. Because of that, she refused to be baptized. But because of the beautiful fellowshipping and the cooperation of the missionaries, I finally did baptize her. Then, we went into the temple during the open house for the Tokyo Temple. When we saw the sealing room, we all cried because we knew that we could be together for all eternity, and we have decided to go to that sacred spot again. My sister got baptized September 11, and I felt so strongly I should introduce to my grandparents the gospel, which I did. Now, they have studied and believe, and they are ready to be baptized next Saturday, this Saturday. And I will baptize them. Oh, what a great blessing I receive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Missionary Challenge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Brothers and sisters, this is one just simple example, but just at the close of my talk I want to share the essence of why the members of the Church should be involved in the missionary work so aggressively and why the Brethren of the Church ask us to involve ourselves in the missionary work. Brother Monson put it so beautifully:

&lt;i&gt;The eternal truth is: that which we willingly share, we keep; and that which we selfishly keep to ourselves, we lose. We care because we want all of our members elsewhere to be happy. Is there any better reason?&lt;/i&gt; [“Status Report on Missionary Work,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign&lt;/i&gt;, October 1977, p. 8]

Brothers and sisters, direction is so clear. Now you are studying in the most beautiful and most profound and the most inspired institution that you can find anywhere in the world. You are the leaders of the Church, and you are the leaders of the nation, and you are the leaders of the world. And you are the saviors of the world.

Now, brothers and sisters, let’s heed the words of the prophet and all become humble people like the City of Enoch, so that we can involve ourselves in the missionary work, in a humble way so that we can dwell in righteousness, in the city of holiness, even Zion.

I bear you my testimony, my brothers and sisters, the gospel is true. There is nowhere any name under heaven except the name of Jesus of Nazareth whereby we might be saved. We are his brothers and sisters. I bear you my testimony that this is the work of the Lord and this is the Church of God, and we have a responsibility to do the work of the Lord, to share the gospel with our neighbors, our friends and relatives, our parents. I know, I know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of the Lord. I love our Heavenly Father with all my heart and all my soul. I love you missionaries. People are waiting for you to come. And you, brothers and sisters, people are waiting for you to stand before them to share the truth and the knowledge—the everlasting knowledge—you have. Yours is the greatest heritage, to bless the people of the nations and the nations of the world; your forefathers preserved that heritage, and you can bless the people of the nations, even unto eternal life, which witness I bear in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will guide me so that I can say the things that I have in my mind and heart. It is indeed a great privilege for me to stand before you today in this great institution built upon the foundation of the true restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and dedicated to the propagation of knowledge. I consider it an honor to speak to you especially, the Lord’s elite, the leaders of the future and the future leaders of the world.</p>
<p>Today I would like to relate the stories of two great leaders who showed faith and courage in obeying the voice of the Lord. And then, I would like to issue an invitation to each of you to listen to the voice of the prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, the mouthpiece for the Lord, and to obey his voice as he has directed us and continues to direct us to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others.</p>
<h2><b>Nephi’s Leadership</b></h2>
<p>The first story comes from the Book of Mormon. Lehi’s and Ishmael’s families had left Jerusalem and had been sojourning in the wilderness and they “did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness” (1 Nephi 17:1). The scriptures tell us that “notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all” (1 Nephi 17:6).</p>
<p>Each of you sisters here today, suppose that you are Nephi’s wife and you brethren that you are Nephi. You have left Jerusalem and have been sojourning in the wilderness for the space of many days, months, and years, even eight years. “Our women did bear children in the wilderness” (1 Nephi 17:1). Without sufficient sanitary supplies, water, medications, and other necessary aids, many children were born.</p>
<p>Not only that, but while they were in the wilderness they “did live upon raw meat” (1 Nephi 17:2). Can you imagine saying to your daughter, “Sarah, here is your dinner of raw meat”; or to your son, “Matthew, here is some raw meat for your dinner tonight”?</p>
<p>Can you imagine the sufferings and afflictions that you are facing in the wilderness?</p>
<p>But the scripture tells us that “so great were the blessings of the Lord upon” them that they “began to bear their journeyings without murmurings” (1 Nephi 17:2).</p>
<p>And because of their great faith in following the commandments given by the Lord, he said unto them:</p>
<p><i>I will make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;</i></p>
<p><i>And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land.</i> [1 Nephi 17:12–13]</p>
<p>The prophet Nephi said that—</p>
<p><i>if . . .the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.</i> [1 Nephi 17:3]</p>
<p>When they finally reached the seashore, of course, they “were exceedingly rejoiced,” and they called the sea Irreantum, and they called the place “Bountiful, because of its much fruit and honey” (1 Nephi 17:5).</p>
<p>They finally thought that they were settled there, but—</p>
<p><i>it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.</i> [1 Nephi 17:7–8]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I feel very strongly that we do have similar challenges—or invitations—given by the Lord to us today as a Church, as individuals, through President Kimball to share the gospel with all the world as well as with our neighbors.</p>
<p>Nephi could have said to the Lord, “Send me back to Jerusalem where I can find many hands to help me, tools to use, and much wood with which to construct a big ship.” Without saws, hammers, nails, lumber—all he had was a broken bow—instead of responding negatively, he sought to obey the Lord’s will, saying:</p>
<p><i>Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?</i> [1 Nephi 17:9]</p>
<p>Of course the Lord revealed his will:</p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.</i> [1 Nephi 17:10]</p>
<p>And Nephi made a bellows with which to blow the fire, and he made tools from the ore which he melted out of the rock. But the prophet Nephi had his greatest opposition from his older brothers, as you know.</p>
<p><i>And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.</i> [1 Nephi 17:17]</p>
<p>They continued murmuring against him:</p>
<p><i>And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions.</i> [1 Nephi 17:20]</p>
<p><i>And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord.</i> [1 Nephi 17:18]</p>
<p>But Nephi, as you know, replied to them:</p>
<p><i>Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel, would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?</i></p>
<p><i>Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage?. . .</i></p>
<p><i>The waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither and they passed through on dry ground. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . The Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, who were the armies of Pharaoh.</i> [1 Nephi 17:23–24, 26–27]</p>
<p>And so Nephi obeyed the Lord, built the ship, and carried his people to the promised land—in spite of the opposition of his brothers and the difficulties he encountered.</p>
<h2><b>Enoch’s Leadership</b></h2>
<p>I want to relate another story. In the book of Moses, chapter 7, we read:</p>
<p><i>And the Lord said unto me: Go to this people, and say unto them—Repent, lest I come out and smite them with a curse, and they die.</i></p>
<p><i>And he gave unto me a commandment that I should baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, which is full of grace and truth, and of the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son.</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that Enoch continued to call upon all the people, save it were the people of Canaan, to repent;</i></p>
<p><i>And so great was the faith of Enoch, that he led the people of God, . . .and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>The fear of the Lord was upon all nations, so great was the glory of the Lord, which was upon his people. And the Lord blessed the land, and they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish.</i></p>
<p><i>And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them [spiritually or physically].</i></p>
<p><i>And Enoch continued his preaching in righteousness unto the people of God. And it came to pass in his days, that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion.</i> [Moses 7:10–13, 17–19]</p>
<p>Oh, what great faith Enoch had! Not only was Enoch’s faith great, but the people of Enoch were also very humble themselves. “They were of one heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness.” Therefore, there were no spiritually and physically poor among them.</p>
<h2><b>Our Prophet’s Leadership</b></h2>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, the Lord has commanded us in this day, through our living prophet, to teach the gospel to all the people, to go into all the world, and to “baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p>In one of our Church hymns we sing:</p>
<p><i>Come, listen to a prophet’s voice,</i><br />
<i>And hear the word of God,</i><br />
<i>And in the way of truth rejoice,</i><br />
<i>And sing for joy aloud;</i></p>
<p><i>We’ve found the way the prophets went,</i><br />
<i>Who lived in days of yore;</i><br />
<i>Another prophet now is sent</i><br />
<i>This knowledge to restore.</i><br />
[<i>Hymns</i>, no. 46]</p>
<p>What strength we add to our testimonies as we see the Lord’s guiding hand in his great church and in the preparation of his prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball.</p>
<p>I say to all of you today,</p>
<p><i>Come, listen to a prophet’s voice, . . .</i><br />
<i>For God has shown his face [again]. . . .</i><br />
<i>The Savior to his people saith,</i><br />
<i>“Let all my words obey.”</i><br />
[<i>Hymns</i>, no. 46]</p>
<p>“Let all my words obey.” They—</p>
<p><i>who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who spake as they were inspired by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of him in all things, should have eternal life.</i> [D&amp;C 20:26]</p>
<p>President Kimball, the living prophet, teaches us many things, such as:</p>
<p>The sacred mission of Jesus Christ<br />
The purpose of life<br />
Eternal marriage and how to have a truly happy married life<br />
Family influences<br />
How to have a full and abundant life<br />
Family preparedness, and<br />
How to fortify our homes against the evils of the world.</p>
<p>He teaches us:</p>
<p>Faith<br />
Forgiveness<br />
Repentance<br />
Obedience<br />
Cleanliness<br />
Reverence<br />
Righteous living<br />
To follow the commandments of the Lord<br />
To honor the Sabbath<br />
The meaning of the sacrament<br />
Truth<br />
Salvation<br />
The importance of:<br />
Children<br />
Scripture study<br />
Genealogy<br />
Temple work<br />
Keeping a journal<br />
Honoring the priesthood<br />
Priesthood responsibilities<br />
The Relief Society organization<br />
Welfare services<br />
Loving one another<br />
Service<br />
Labor<br />
Gardening<br />
Filling Church assignments, and so on.</p>
<p>He teaches us about our most important personal Liahona. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Oh, how I believe the words of Elder Thomas S. Monson, who said:</p>
<p><i>I believe the Church has never had a person more oriented toward spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ than President Spencer W. Kimball. This has been true throughout his entire life. . . .He truly has the missionary spirit. The impact of his dynamics as a missionary-oriented person, his long experience, and the call through him as the Lord’s Prophet, Seer, and Revelator have set in motion factors which have resulted in one of the greatest upsurges in missionary work that we have ever seen.</i> [“Status Report on Missionary Work,” <i>Ensign</i>, October 1977, p. 8]</p>
<p>In order for all of us to be prepared in righteousness to come and dwell with the Lord in a city of holiness, we must follow the prophet’s voice. Let us heed President Kimball’s example and do our part in the missionary cause.</p>
<p>Regarding member missionary work, President Kimball recently said that it is—</p>
<p><i>not simply left to our discretion and pleasure. Every man and woman should return home from this conference with a determination that they will take the gospel to their relatives and their families. If they do not, they must consider that they are not in the total favor of their Heavenly Father, because he commanded us to do so!</i></p>
<p><i>To some extent we have been bypassing our neighbors. There are millions of great, wonderful Protestants, Catholics, and others, and they want it just the same. They may not know what they want, but they want it just the same. And you and I only can give it to them. The gospel is without price.</i> [Auckland, New Zealand, Area Conference, 1980]</p>
<p>President Kimball further stated:</p>
<p><i>One of the highest forms of Christian service is to share the gospel because with its acceptance come so many other blessings. There is a special accountability to receive the oracles of God, the authoritative counsel from God’s oracles.</i></p>
<p><i>And all they who receive the oracles of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation, thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains descend upon their house</i> (D&amp;C 90:5).</p>
<p>And he continued:</p>
<p><i>I am concerned with all that has been written and all that has been said. Many of our people are still hard of hearing and seemingly unwilling to make the effort to proselyte their neighbors. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>We are busy people, but we must remember a heavy responsibility has been placed upon us. We must not expect the way to be easy. We must not expect to grow without some obstacles.</i></p>
<p><i>We must remember what a development comes to us as we teach (share) the gospel. Perhaps almost more comes to us than to them. We know, of course, there are disappointments and many people will not accept.</i> [Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976, p. 4]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is our great need, great desire, great dream, and great obsession to bring this everlasting light, which is the gospel of the Lord, to the people of the world, this</p>
<p><i>candle of understanding to light the way out of obscurity and darkness. Our message is to bring light into the world, and our charge to convert the people of the world to accept the truth.</i> [Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976, p. 1]</p>
<p>On 3 April 1975, President Kimball charged the members of the Church with the following:</p>
<p><i>Members must be finders. . . . Members should shoulder this responsibility. Every member knows nonmembers he or she can refer to the missionaries. Every father, mother, and youth in this Church should share the gospel by giving a Book of Mormon by telling the account of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or by inviting our acquaintances to a special meeting.</i> [Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976]</p>
<h2><b>A Missionary Story</b></h2>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, may I just share with you a wonderful and beautiful story. Brother Isogai is 17 years old, and right before I left for this conference trip to Salt Lake, he passed on to me his conversion story, which I want to share with you today.</p>
<p><i>My family consists of three members. We are now living in our grandparents’ home because two years ago my parents got divorced. Since then our grandfather and my mother started working to support us. Some time in October 1979, I met the missionaries on the street near Shibuya station. I studied and I was baptized, and I became inactive following my baptism.</i></p>
<p><i>Since my family was not stable, I was not happy, and I wondered about my future, though I was baptized—about my life, about my family. I wondered, I wondered, I wondered every day. And one day I wandered through Shibuya again. I was feeling depressed. With the feeling of depression and emptiness in my heart, I was walking toward a church without conscious direction. While there, I attended a beautiful baptism service. I was very impressed and inspired by it. I decided to come back to the Church, which I did.</i></p>
<p><i>I learned of the importance of the missionary work, and I helped the missionaries, and I did this particularly almost every day. I went to the street with the missionaries. And I contacted many people. One day I had been praying, and I received a strong feeling that I should teach my own family. I had baptized seven of my friends within two months. So I started to introduce the gospel to my family. First, I thought I should introduce it to my mother. My mother has many friends, and she was attending another Christian church. Because of that, she refused to be baptized. But because of the beautiful fellowshipping and the cooperation of the missionaries, I finally did baptize her. Then, we went into the temple during the open house for the Tokyo Temple. When we saw the sealing room, we all cried because we knew that we could be together for all eternity, and we have decided to go to that sacred spot again. My sister got baptized September 11, and I felt so strongly I should introduce to my grandparents the gospel, which I did. Now, they have studied and believe, and they are ready to be baptized next Saturday, this Saturday. And I will baptize them. Oh, what a great blessing I receive.</i></p>
<h2><b>Our Missionary Challenge</b></h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is one just simple example, but just at the close of my talk I want to share the essence of why the members of the Church should be involved in the missionary work so aggressively and why the Brethren of the Church ask us to involve ourselves in the missionary work. Brother Monson put it so beautifully:</p>
<p><i>The eternal truth is: that which we willingly share, we keep; and that which we selfishly keep to ourselves, we lose. We care because we want all of our members elsewhere to be happy. Is there any better reason?</i> [“Status Report on Missionary Work,” <i>Ensign</i>, October 1977, p. 8]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, direction is so clear. Now you are studying in the most beautiful and most profound and the most inspired institution that you can find anywhere in the world. You are the leaders of the Church, and you are the leaders of the nation, and you are the leaders of the world. And you are the saviors of the world.</p>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, let’s heed the words of the prophet and all become humble people like the City of Enoch, so that we can involve ourselves in the missionary work, in a humble way so that we can dwell in righteousness, in the city of holiness, even Zion.</p>
<p>I bear you my testimony, my brothers and sisters, the gospel is true. There is nowhere any name under heaven except the name of Jesus of Nazareth whereby we might be saved. We are his brothers and sisters. I bear you my testimony that this is the work of the Lord and this is the Church of God, and we have a responsibility to do the work of the Lord, to share the gospel with our neighbors, our friends and relatives, our parents. I know, I know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of the Lord. I love our Heavenly Father with all my heart and all my soul. I love you missionaries. People are waiting for you to come. And you, brothers and sisters, people are waiting for you to stand before them to share the truth and the knowledge—the everlasting knowledge—you have. Yours is the greatest heritage, to bless the people of the nations and the nations of the world; your forefathers preserved that heritage, and you can bless the people of the nations, even unto eternal life, which witness I bear in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">His reputation for concern for the one—particularly the widow or the wounded, the poor or the persecuted—is widely known. Perhaps you would also like to know, if you don’t already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monson’s close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because I’m sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, I’d like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didn’t know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have looked forward to the opportunity of accepting the assignment and the invitation to be with you today, for I realize you are the heart and soul of many of the parents of this Church, all over the world. What a glorious sight you are! I am also pleased to recognize the officers and faculty members of this fine institution.
My dear young brothers and sisters, you are in the prime of your lives. You are on the cutting edge of progress. You live in a time of extreme difficulties but also a time of exceptional opportunities. I think the nation and the world have never been beset with a greater variety of challenges to meet and problems to solve, and you and those similar to you are destined to meet those challenges and to solve those problems. I know you can, because the Lord will provide the help you need.
I love the passage from the book of Acts in the New Testament where we read of the confrontation between a man from Ethiopia, who was reading from scripture, and Philip of old. Philip asked the man if he understood the words he was reading. The man replied to Philip, “How can I, except some man should guide me?”1 Of course Philip sat with him and guided him in his understanding.
Just last Thursday I was sitting in the room in the Salt Lake Temple where the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve meet once each week. I gazed up at the wall which faces the First Presidency, and there I observed a portrait of each President of the Church. As my gaze moved from the Prophet Joseph right down through President Hinckley, I thought, “We have had great Presidents of this Church. Each one has guided us; his writings have stimulated us; his messages have inspired us. To show us the way, we have those whom the Lord has provided.”
Some years ago I spoke here of the Presidents of the Church I have known, giving brief personal glimpses. Today I would like to mention each one in greater depth.
The man who was President of the Church when I was born and who was president until I was nearly eighteen years old was the seventh President of the Church, Heber J. Grant. He was ordained and set apart as President on November 23, 1918, at the age of 62.
The Church was a little different when President Grant was President. His personal office was what we refer to now as the First Presidency Boardroom. He sat at a large, rather imposing desk in the enormous room, and just about anyone could drop in to see him. The Church was relatively small at the time. A friend of mine told me that he and another young man had been asked to visit President Grant to see if he would come to their ward and speak at the commemoration of the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood they were planning. He said they walked through the front door of the Church Administration Building, walked to the back of the building where President Grant’s secretary sat, and said, “Is the President in?”
She replied, “Yes, wou</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thirty-three years ago, while a student at Brigham Young University, I had a small role in an evening fireside like the one we are holding tonight. The speaker was President Spencer W. Kimball, and I found myself walking next to him as he moved toward the entry coming into the Marriott Center. I asked him if he ever became nervous standing before such a large assembly. With a smile, he responded: “Brother Andersen, you know that the scriptures say, ‘If ye are prepared ye shall not fear’ (D&amp;C 38:30). I am trembling from my head to my toes.” Tonight I know how he felt.
I express my love and respect for each of you seated here and for you who are gathered across the world. I know of your goodness and devotion to the gospel, your faith and hope for the future, and your desire to please your Heavenly Father. I pray that the Lord’s Spirit will bless my words and your understanding.
Hold Fast to the Iron Rod
I want to tell you of the Lord’s guiding hand in our meeting tonight. During the early days of January I worked to organize and outline what I would present to you. Knowing that Elder David A. Bednar was scheduled to speak to you in February, I asked him if he had finalized the subject he would address.
I was taken aback when he responded that his talk was about holding fast to the iron rod. It was the exact title I had chosen for my talk. The choir was already practicing this beautiful number that they have just shared with us.
As Elder Bednar and I discussed the messages we had prepared, it was evident that we had approached the subject differently. Elder Bednar thought for a moment and said: “The Lord loves the young adults of the Church. There is purpose in this. This is a message the Lord wants delivered.” I determined to proceed.
Then, just a week later and before Elder Bednar’s talk, President Boyd K. Packer, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a BYU devotional address he entitled “Lehi’s Dream and You.”1 He too included in his talk what it means to hold fast to the iron rod.
My brothers and sisters, this is a subject the Lord wants you to think about.
You will remember from the talks of President Packer and Elder Bednar, and from your own study of the Book of Mormon, the key elements of Lehi’s dream of the tree of life. Elder Bednar taught us that the tree of life, identified as the love of God, is a representation of Jesus Christ and that the joy and happiness received by partaking of the fruit of the tree symbolizes the blessings of the Savior’s Atonement (see 1 Nephi 8:10; 11:8–9, 21–24).2

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great honor for me to welcome you to a new semester at Brigham Young University. My husband and I want you to know that we love and admire you. Your success and growth spiritually, academically, intellectually, and socially are of great importance to us as well as to others associated with the university. In every area of interest to you we encourage you to strive for integrity and excellence. The experiences and knowledge gained during your time here will influence the rest of your lives.
A few years ago my husband and I were enjoying visiting Australia. It was promising to be another beautiful spring day in the outskirts of Sydney. We were to be involved in a mission presidents’ seminar for presidents and their wives in that area of the world. However, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, the telephone rang and woke us from our sleep. My experience with middle-of-the-night telephone calls has been that they usually portend bad news. Thus, as my husband got out of bed to answer the phone, I was quite nervous and concerned. As he answered the phone, I heard him say, “Hello, Emma.”
I relaxed somewhat, knowing that Emma was his secretary in the Office of the Seventy. I knew that we were 16 hours ahead of Salt Lake City time and it was Tuesday during working hours there. My thought was that she just wanted to talk to him before he became involved in the meetings of the day. However, his response to whatever she was saying to him was a very shocked “Oh, no!”
Again I became very concerned and surmised that it was not good news but involved something or someone from the Church family and not our own immediate one. I recall that he hung up the telephone and came and said to me that Emma had just reported to him that two planes had hit the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. We were instructed to remain in Australia until further notice.
We, of course, got up and turned on the television and were filled with shock, horror, and great sadness as we saw and heard of the devastating attacks in our homeland. The seminar began that day, but, as you can imagine, it wasn’t quite business as usual. A great somberness filled all our hearts. I felt such a heaviness of spirit.
The day proceeded with an abbreviated schedule as well as phone calls by the participants in the seminar to their homes and families. We were also informed that we would be able to receive the audio portion of a program to be held that evening originating from the Tabernacle on Temple Square.
The time came to hear the broadcast from Salt Lake City. I cannot recall exactly what was said or sung that night; however, I can vividly recall how I was affected when I heard the voice of our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, as he spoke from thousands of miles away. Just to hear his voice seemed to lift much of the sadness and gloom I was feeling. I will always remember and treasur</span>
