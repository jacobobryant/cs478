  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear friends, what a privilege it is for Christiane and me to be here with you. As we discuss important and eternal matters today, you soon will recognize that I am German, not only because of my funny accent but also because of my very direct approach. In the German language we refer to the idiom &lt;i&gt;mit jemanden Deutsch reden,&lt;/i&gt; which would directly translate to “talking German to someone.” It means to express things in a simple, very clear, and direct manner so that no one can misunderstand. So now you know what you will have to put up with today.

The time between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve is a very special time of the year. As the days get shorter, the nights grow longer, and the temperatures drop lower, we seek light and warmth. These elements are found in abundance in all the Christmas lighting that surrounds us. It is in these dark months that we enjoy the shining candles in the house, a romantic candlelight dinner with someone we love, or—if we find time—relaxing a little by just sitting and reading a good book close to a crackling fireplace.

Christmas lights, candles, and open fireplaces provide light and warmth. They not only make us feel cozy but also help us to direct our thoughts to the source of all light: the Light of Life, the Light of the World, even our Savior Jesus Christ. Celebrating His birth and pondering His life remind us of the dependency we have upon His light and the gratitude we feel for the mortal and eternal blessings of His Atonement. This season also helps us realize what matters most in life and often is a time of serious personal reflection and evaluation as we consider the past and contemplate the future.

Sadly and far too often this wonderful season of reevaluation becomes “the time of good intentions,” when our resolutions to be better end in “sudden death” within a few days or weeks into the new year. As a boy I often set New Year’s resolutions with great excitement and enthusiasm. My mother, observing my weaknesses and sometimes my failure to carry out these goals, used to say, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

I suspect all of us fall short in totally living up to our resolutions. But we ought to try to do better—especially those of us who know the importance of committing ourselves to follow the real Light of the World. To us the prophet Isaiah said, “Let us walk in the light of the Lord.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

To walk in this light, our lives need a long-term orientation based on knowledge and conviction—knowledge of who we really are and the purpose of our creation as well as a conviction of our eternal destiny. We know that we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. As such, we know He wants us to fill “the measure of [our] creation.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He wants us to find joy and happiness in this life and ultimately reach our destination of immortality and eternal life “crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Now I am looking into your eyes and seeing your smiling faces. As I try to envision your dreams and feel your hopes, I think back to when I was as young as you are now. Just having returned from my mission, I was dating a beautiful girl who, after a short period of nervous resistance, fearful investigation, and doubtful anticipation, finally decided to put up with me and give me an honest try. She now is the mother of our seven children, is as beautiful as always, and is sitting here with us on the stand today.

In my youth and young adult years I often asked myself this question: “Erich, where will you be ten years from now?” (Now that I am getting older, I’m not so interested in that question anymore.) I remember well how my dreams and visions for my future had an important impact upon the decisions that I made.

For example, when I was a young boy our extended family often got together to celebrate birthdays. Among the families were nine children, and every birthday was like a mini family reunion. Aunt Anni was my favorite because she seemed to be the never-tiring playmate. She would wrestle with us, play funny games, and just spend time with us. We loved her laugh, her excitement, and her enthusiasm. She never seemed to be depressed or to have a bad day. I still get excited just thinking about her.

Because of her example I envisioned that my future wife would be like her. I wanted my wife to be lively and full of excitement and enthusiasm. In my dream I even saw her as a grandmother, running around with her grandchildren, never tired, and always happy. Somehow I had internalized that vision so much that this became the model I was looking for, and guess what? This is exactly what I was blessed to receive. Christiane is full of excitement and enthusiasm, and she loves to play with the children and grandchildren. They love her and I love being around her.

The lesson to be learned from this example is that dreams and visions are important. They determine the directions, goals, and priorities we are setting for our lives. The scriptures teach the following: “Where there is &lt;i&gt;no vision,&lt;/i&gt; the people &lt;i&gt;perish. &lt;/i&gt;”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Sometimes our understanding of a principle is enhanced if we reverse the phrasing, which in this case would read: “Where there &lt;i&gt;is a vision,&lt;/i&gt; the people &lt;i&gt;flourish.”&lt;/i&gt; I truly believe this to be true because I have witnessed it in my own life and in the lives of many others around me.

The scripture then continues, “But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

This brings me to ask you two very personal questions: What is your personal vision for your life? and What are you doing to fulfill it?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Vision of Joy and Happiness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Something every one of us envisions is to be happy in our lives. One of the divine purposes of our very existence is to experience joy and happiness. Lehi taught, “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; The prophet Joseph F. Smith saw in a vision that the resurrection of the righteous to eternal life will bring them “a fulness of joy.”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

In his famous dream the prophet Lehi beheld that the fruit of the tree of life “was desirable to make one happy.”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; This is why Alma described the plan God has for us, His children, as “the great plan of happiness.”&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Joy and happiness are inseparably connected with choosing the lifestyle God has in mind for us, making covenants with Him, and keeping His commandments with all our “might, mind and strength.”&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

This joy is not to be confused with the pleasures of the world. Real happiness and joy have little to do with the amount of money in my bank account, the size of my home, the number of expensive (and, of course, German) cars registered in my name, or the most mind-boggling and ever-important question: “My dear, will the new boat fit into our garage?”

True happiness and joy arise from our relationship with the Father and the Son and our knowledge that we are completely in tune with Them. They also stem from the loving relationships we have with the people who surround us. Therefore, “in this life [we] shall have joy, and again in the flesh [we] shall see God.”&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; The quality and congeniality in our relationships with our spouses, children, grandchildren, friends, and associates determine the level of joy in our lives. We will be increasingly happy if we and our loved ones are living “after the manner of happiness.”&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

My dear young friends, have you already established a clear and strong vision for your life that includes the pillars of real happiness and joy? If not, I invite you to do so; if you have, I invite you to embrace your vision with all your heart. It will inspire and guide you in all the critical decisions that you are making during this wonderful season of your life.

Let me share with you a doctrine that will help you reach your righteous desire and yearning for happiness more than anything else. If clearly understood and applied, it will bring joy and tremendous security into your life, independent from any circumstances you may face. This doctrine reaches far beyond this earthly life right into eternity. I am talking about the doctrine of the family.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Doctrine of the Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The concept of family and family life as a true source for happiness has been terribly hollowed out in recent decades. The traditional family is under attack from many different sources worldwide. But there are other pitfalls and risks that even relate to some of us who know about the importance, divinity, and eternal destiny of the family. Influenced by the world and its enticements, the increasing desire for self-centered fulfillment, and the inclination for comfort or for making things easy, we put the family and our happiness under stress. All too often happiness in our life is defined by the quality of our “all-around carefree package,” which we hope to achieve and retain in a “low-investment, high-return” mode.

But life does not work in this way. It was never intended to be easy. The Lord said to Joseph Smith: “For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

The Lord has clearly revealed how to develop and retain strong families. We all are invited to study and apply the principles set forth in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” Additionally, we need to recognize that drawing personal strength and happiness from family life requires some sacrifice and faith.

The family proclamation states “that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.” It further states “that God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Among many, the image and purpose of the family has drastically changed. Increasingly, society is adopting the so-called “soul mate” model of marriage, which focuses on the needs and feelings of the adults as opposed to those of the children. As a result, many enter marriage after a long-standing relationship rather than moving forward after an appropriate courtship. Finding the perfect match, testing a relationship by cohabitation without the benefit of marriage, or securing a lavish lifestyle that will be backed by a robust prenuptial agreement have become common practices among many before they even consider marriage.

Scripture and modern-day prophets teach us differently. We build our marriages on the foundation of chastity and fidelity, with the intent to establish and rear a family. The prophet of my youth, President Spencer W. Kimball, taught:

&lt;i&gt;The lighted way, then, brings us to normal, clean courting of young men and women, coming eventually to a virtuous union at an altar where a fully authorized servant of God seals the union for eternity. The Hebrew Saints were properly taught, “Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.” (Hebrews 13:4.) &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And to those who might decry marriage or postpone it or forbid it, Paul spoke, condemning them. It is generally selfishness, cold and self-centered, which leads people to shun marriage responsibility. &lt;/i&gt;

President Kimball continued:

&lt;i&gt;There are many who talk and write against marriage. Even some of our own delay marriage and argue against it. . . . We call upon all people to accept normal marriage as a basis for true happiness. . . . Basically marriage presupposes a family. The psalmist said: “Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. . . . Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.” (Psalm 127:3, 5.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1974/04/guidelines-to-carry-forth-the-work-of-god-in-cleanliness?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

When Christiane and I were young, these were the words of our living prophet, and we trusted and followed his advice. We knelt across the altar of the Swiss Temple, being only twenty-two and twenty years of age. We were worthy of the covenant, we had no real clue of what to expect, we had no work experience or finished education, and we were as poor as church mice. All that we had in abundance was our love for each other and a lot of naïve enthusiasm. But we began building our world together. We did not postpone having children, and we needed to support each other in getting our educations. We strongly believed in the Lord’s promise that “if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.”&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

And He did. When we married, Christiane was in nursing school. Our vision included having her finish her degree, but at the same time we also made a conscious decision to begin fulfilling our dream of having a family. As a result, our first child was born about two weeks before Christiane passed her final exam as a certified nurse.

However, we knew that even in our marriage there would be stumbling blocks, challenges, and some difficulties. But we had a simple oral agreement, which we often repeated with smiles on our faces: “If difficulties approach, no manslaughter and no divorce.”

Now, thirty-six years later, we are grateful that we could build this family together. Our faith in God and our relationship with each other have become unshaken as we have seen the hand of the Lord guiding us through the process of building our kingdom in mortality, which at present consists of seven children and six grandchildren. This kingdom will continue to grow, forever and ever.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Importance of Sacrifice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
For this vision of happiness we both were ready and willing to sacrifice. We accepted the divinely appointed roles of the father “to preside” and “to provide” and of the mother to “nurture.”&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Sister Julie B. Beck, former general Relief Society president of the Church, stated:

&lt;i&gt;The priesthood role of fathers is to preside and pass priesthood ordinances to the next generation. The priesthood role of mothers is to influence. These are essential, complimentary, and interdependent responsibilities. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

Helping one another in a marriage and family as equal partners does not mean that we always do the same things or do everything together or in equal shares. We understand and accept different roles given to us by divine design as outlined in the proclamation on the family. We are not following the world in what is described as “emancipation,” in which both husband and wife live only to fulfill their own self-interests. We are living the principles of complementariness and completion with respect to each other and to our children.

In a BYU devotional address given almost thirty years ago, President James E. Faust counseled the sisters to be careful not to do everything at once and to do first what is most important for the family, and then other desires can follow. He said, “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Then he said:

&lt;i&gt;It seems that the new roles of women have not decreased their responsibility because, while the new roles are challenging, the old roles of wife and mother are in the soul and cry out to be satisfied. . . . Fortunately&lt;/i&gt; [in most cases, I would like to add], &lt;i&gt;women do not have to track a career like a man does. A woman may fit more than one career into the various seasons of life. She cannot sing all of the verses of her song at the same time. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_message-granddaughters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Striving for the Ideal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My young friends, some of you may say: “Well, our situation is different. The world today is not ideal. There must be room for exceptions.” With regard to making exceptions, President Boyd K. Packer once told the following story:

&lt;i&gt;As mission president, I attended a mission Relief Society conference. Our mission Relief Society president, a relatively recent convert, announced something of a course correction. Some local societies had strayed, and she invited them to conform more closely to the direction set by the general presidency of the Relief Society. &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;One sister in the congregation stood and defiantly told her that they were not willing to follow her counsel, saying they were an exception. A bit flustered, she turned to me for help. I didn’t know what to do. I was not interested in facing a fierce woman. So I motioned for her to proceed. Then came the revelation! &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;This lovely Relief Society president, small and somewhat handicapped physically, said with gentle firmness: “Dear sister, we’d like not to take care of the exception first. We will take care of the rule first, and then we will see to the exceptions.” The course correction was accepted. &lt;/i&gt;

President Packer continued:

&lt;i&gt;Her advice is good for Relief Society and priesthood and for families. When you state a rule and include the exception in the same sentence, the exception is accepted first.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Therefore I am attempting to teach you the rule or the divine ideal and let you deal with exceptions as you walk the course of your life. In the vision we had for our family, we wanted Christiane to stay home to rear our children. This meant sacrifice. Shortly after we learned that a baby was on its way, Christiane reminded me of the mutual decision we had made even before our wedding day that she would immediately stop working outside the home as soon as a baby was born. I tried to escape what I knew would be additional responsibility by mentioning that she was contributing one-third of our family income. Her simple answer was: “That is your problem. I will take care of the children and you take care of putting food on the table.”

I knew she was right. We had discussed it long before, it was in tune with our vision of family life, it was in tune with the words of the living prophets, and it felt right. So she gave up her well-paying career as a nurse to be close to the children and to meet their daily needs, and I had to get my act together to provide food and shelter. The Lord blessed us to be able to fulfill this aspect of our vision.

Other important matters, such as parenting, teaching, mentoring, cleaning, or even diaper changing, we did together as often as circumstances allowed. This division of labor occurred because it had always been part of how we envisioned our family life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Importance of Faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It requires faith to establish and act upon a vision. But it is only when we move forward in faith that we put ourselves in a position in which the Lord can bless us. A young couple recently shared an experience with me that illustrates this point.

As it had been with Christiane and me, their vision was to begin their family as soon as possible after they were married. They had two criteria for doing so: they needed health insurance and they wanted to be able to care for their baby without using child care.

Not too long after the wife graduated from college, she got a job that provided health insurance and would allow her to work from home. Their plans seemed to have fallen in place exactly as they had hoped, and soon they were expecting their first child. They felt they could both care for the baby between their work and school schedules.

In the summer, the soon-to-be father was looking for an internship in his chosen profession. He had several interviews, but none of them worked out. In October, when his wife was seven months pregnant, she got a call from her boss. The boss informed her that the federal grant that funded her salary would not be renewed. The agency was happy to offer her another job, but she would not be able to work from home. The couple was heartbroken. They thought they had planned well and that the circumstances were perfect for the wife to be able to stay home with the baby.

Several weeks went by, and they adjusted to the idea that they would need to use some form of day care. About three weeks before her December due date, the husband received a call out of the blue from one of the business owners who had interviewed him in the summer. The man said he had just made some new hires and had put a rejection letter in the mail to the husband. But then he had had a very strong feeling that he should hire the husband. The business owner told the young man to ignore the rejection letter, and he then offered him a full-time position with benefits.

In concluding her account of these events, the wife wrote:

&lt;i&gt;We were overjoyed. We knew that the Lord had taken a special interest in our desire for me to be a stay-at-home mom. And the Lord’s plan was even better than our plan. If things had gone our way, I would have had to work while caring for our child, but with this new situation I was able to devote my full time and attention to our new baby, which had always been our ultimate goal. &lt;/i&gt;

Like this young couple, Christiane and I have found that as we have acted in faith and have trusted the Lord, He has helped us to do His will in His way and according to His timing. Now I have to say that His way did not mean that everything turned out immediately the way we thought it would. Sometimes we had to be very patient, sometimes we had to put in some extra effort, and sometimes it even was as if the Lord was testing our seriousness. However, our vision always has inspired us and has been the foundation for our most important decisions.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look to the Temple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One thing Christiane and I always envisioned was for us to be with our children in the celestial room of a temple as a prelude for the eternal joy and glory we hope one day to experience. Over the past several years we have taken one child after another to receive their temple ordinances, symbolically returning them to our Heavenly Father after teaching them the principles of righteousness.

We just had the last experience of that kind two months ago, when one of our youngest sons entered the temple. We have accompanied three of our children to temple altars as they have married their sweethearts, and we anticipate more temple weddings to come. Nothing has provided more happiness and satisfaction in our lives than the joy we have found in one another and in our posterity. Once we understood that these are just the beginnings of our eternal progression and therefore only the very first levels of our joy and happiness, we were and are continually willing to sacrifice all that we have to live the doctrine of the family and to see our vision fully realized.

I invite you, my dear young friends, to ponder this doctrine and come to know for yourselves what really matters most. This type of happiness is at the heart of our existence. And happiness that stems from congenial relationships among husband, wife, and children is always growing and increasing.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be Serious About What Matters Most&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There is one more thing that you need to do after you have studied the doctrine of the family and have established a vision for your happiness. You have to become serious about implementing your vision. I would like to share an additional lesson from my personal experience.

The first initial rejections I received in my courtship with Christiane made me a little discouraged. I had just about decided to begin a fruitful career as a young single adult in the Church. One day I had a special spiritual impression. I was participating in an ordinance in the Swiss Temple when I heard a voice in my heart saying something to this effect: “Erich, if you do not seriously strive to marry and enter into the new and everlasting covenant, all these teachings and promised blessings really make no difference for you.” It was a wake-up call that I received at the very young age of twenty-one, and from that moment I tried even harder to be worthy of that blessing.

I invite you to set personal goals regarding your vision. In &lt;i&gt;Preach My Gospel&lt;/i&gt; we read:

&lt;i&gt;Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can accomplish. Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

I invite you to be serious. Do not trifle with sacred things. Once you reach a marriageable age, don’t just date for fun. Never compromise your eternal birthright by doing anything that would deprive you of making the most important covenants in the temple. As you treat every date as a potential eternal companion, you will never do inappropriate things that would physically or spiritually harm your date or compromise your own worthiness and darken your vision. Your spiritual perception will never be dimmed and you will always be entitled to the whisperings of the Spirit. He will encourage and confirm as you make these most important decisions in your life, even if at times you are scared to death.

Hold yourself accountable to the Lord with respect to your vision and goals in life. If there is something you need to repent of, don’t hesitate a second to do so. Both this life and eternal life are too important to procrastinate the day of our repentance. Follow the invitation of the Savior, who encouraged us to

&lt;i&gt;ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Principle of Finishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I would like to share a thought with those of you who are trying hard to implement these principles but have not yet succeeded. I recognize that some of you, given your circumstances, may need to adapt the ideal vision of a family to fit your personal situation. But I have learned that the Lord will help us as we act in faith and follow the ideal to the extent possible.

The gospel of Jesus Christ includes a most comforting component. It is the “finishing” or “completing” aspect of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Moroni admonished us to always stay on the right way, “relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who [is] the author and the finisher of [our] faith.”&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;

Because of the faith that we have in Jesus Christ, we can pursue the course in life we need to take, but if we fail because of weakness or missing opportunities, He will either reach out to us or fill in the gap and become the finisher of our faith. It is He who stated, “For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.”&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

And from the Church Handbook we read:

&lt;i&gt;Faithful members whose circumstances do not allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life will receive all promised blessings in the eternities, provided they keep the covenants they have made with God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;

I testify that the Lord meant what He said when He stated that “it is not good that the man should be alone”&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; and that His ultimate desire for all of His children is that they receive “a fulness of joy.”&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, always keep your vision before you and

&lt;i&gt;strive for the ideal of living in an eternal family. This means preparing to become worthy spouses and loving fathers or mothers. In some cases these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;

Now, at the beginning of my remarks I promised you the direct “German approach.” So please do not be offended at what I have said. I know there are as many different life circumstances as there are people in this room. I know there are differences in cultures, traditions, and expectations. However, the doctrines and principles outlined today are eternal and true, and they stand independent from our personal life situations. I have every confidence that as you sincerely ponder and prayerfully consider your personal vision in the context of these doctrines and principles, you will be able to develop a vision for your life that will be pleasing to the Lord and lead to your greatest happiness.

I testify of these wonderful truths. God lives; Jesus is the Christ. It is through the plan of the Father and the Atonement of Jesus Christ that we have access to such marvelous opportunities for happiness in this life and promises of a future in which our individual kingdoms will be expanded beyond our current capacity to fully understand. So, once more I ask you: What is your vision for &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; life? and What are you willing to do to achieve it?

I pray the blessings of heaven on you as you ponder these questions and strive to obtain sacred and eternal blessings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>My dear friends, what a privilege it is for Christiane and me to be here with you. As we discuss important and eternal matters today, you soon will recognize that I am German, not only because of my funny accent but also because of my very direct approach. In the German language we refer to the idiom <i>mit jemanden Deutsch reden,</i> which would directly translate to “talking German to someone.” It means to express things in a simple, very clear, and direct manner so that no one can misunderstand. So now you know what you will have to put up with today.</p>
<p>The time between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve is a very special time of the year. As the days get shorter, the nights grow longer, and the temperatures drop lower, we seek light and warmth. These elements are found in abundance in all the Christmas lighting that surrounds us. It is in these dark months that we enjoy the shining candles in the house, a romantic candlelight dinner with someone we love, or—if we find time—relaxing a little by just sitting and reading a good book close to a crackling fireplace.</p>
<p>Christmas lights, candles, and open fireplaces provide light and warmth. They not only make us feel cozy but also help us to direct our thoughts to the source of all light: the Light of Life, the Light of the World, even our Savior Jesus Christ. Celebrating His birth and pondering His life remind us of the dependency we have upon His light and the gratitude we feel for the mortal and eternal blessings of His Atonement. This season also helps us realize what matters most in life and often is a time of serious personal reflection and evaluation as we consider the past and contemplate the future.</p>
<p>Sadly and far too often this wonderful season of reevaluation becomes “the time of good intentions,” when our resolutions to be better end in “sudden death” within a few days or weeks into the new year. As a boy I often set New Year’s resolutions with great excitement and enthusiasm. My mother, observing my weaknesses and sometimes my failure to carry out these goals, used to say, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”</p>
<p>I suspect all of us fall short in totally living up to our resolutions. But we ought to try to do better—especially those of us who know the importance of committing ourselves to follow the real Light of the World. To us the prophet Isaiah said, “Let us walk in the light of the Lord.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>To walk in this light, our lives need a long-term orientation based on knowledge and conviction—knowledge of who we really are and the purpose of our creation as well as a conviction of our eternal destiny. We know that we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. As such, we know He wants us to fill “the measure of [our] creation.”<sup>2</sup> He wants us to find joy and happiness in this life and ultimately reach our destination of immortality and eternal life “crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father.”<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Now I am looking into your eyes and seeing your smiling faces. As I try to envision your dreams and feel your hopes, I think back to when I was as young as you are now. Just having returned from my mission, I was dating a beautiful girl who, after a short period of nervous resistance, fearful investigation, and doubtful anticipation, finally decided to put up with me and give me an honest try. She now is the mother of our seven children, is as beautiful as always, and is sitting here with us on the stand today.</p>
<p>In my youth and young adult years I often asked myself this question: “Erich, where will you be ten years from now?” (Now that I am getting older, I’m not so interested in that question anymore.) I remember well how my dreams and visions for my future had an important impact upon the decisions that I made.</p>
<p>For example, when I was a young boy our extended family often got together to celebrate birthdays. Among the families were nine children, and every birthday was like a mini family reunion. Aunt Anni was my favorite because she seemed to be the never-tiring playmate. She would wrestle with us, play funny games, and just spend time with us. We loved her laugh, her excitement, and her enthusiasm. She never seemed to be depressed or to have a bad day. I still get excited just thinking about her.</p>
<p>Because of her example I envisioned that my future wife would be like her. I wanted my wife to be lively and full of excitement and enthusiasm. In my dream I even saw her as a grandmother, running around with her grandchildren, never tired, and always happy. Somehow I had internalized that vision so much that this became the model I was looking for, and guess what? This is exactly what I was blessed to receive. Christiane is full of excitement and enthusiasm, and she loves to play with the children and grandchildren. They love her and I love being around her.</p>
<p>The lesson to be learned from this example is that dreams and visions are important. They determine the directions, goals, and priorities we are setting for our lives. The scriptures teach the following: “Where there is <i>no vision,</i> the people <i>perish. </i>”<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Sometimes our understanding of a principle is enhanced if we reverse the phrasing, which in this case would read: “Where there <i>is a vision,</i> the people <i>flourish.”</i> I truly believe this to be true because I have witnessed it in my own life and in the lives of many others around me.</p>
<p>The scripture then continues, “But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.”<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>This brings me to ask you two very personal questions: What is your personal vision for your life? and What are you doing to fulfill it?</p>
<h2><b>A Vision of Joy and Happiness</b></h2>
<p>Something every one of us envisions is to be happy in our lives. One of the divine purposes of our very existence is to experience joy and happiness. Lehi taught, “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.”<sup>6</sup> The prophet Joseph F. Smith saw in a vision that the resurrection of the righteous to eternal life will bring them “a fulness of joy.”<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>In his famous dream the prophet Lehi beheld that the fruit of the tree of life “was desirable to make one happy.”<sup>8</sup> This is why Alma described the plan God has for us, His children, as “the great plan of happiness.”<sup>9</sup> Joy and happiness are inseparably connected with choosing the lifestyle God has in mind for us, making covenants with Him, and keeping His commandments with all our “might, mind and strength.”<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>This joy is not to be confused with the pleasures of the world. Real happiness and joy have little to do with the amount of money in my bank account, the size of my home, the number of expensive (and, of course, German) cars registered in my name, or the most mind-boggling and ever-important question: “My dear, will the new boat fit into our garage?”</p>
<p>True happiness and joy arise from our relationship with the Father and the Son and our knowledge that we are completely in tune with Them. They also stem from the loving relationships we have with the people who surround us. Therefore, “in this life [we] shall have joy, and again in the flesh [we] shall see God.”<sup>11</sup> The quality and congeniality in our relationships with our spouses, children, grandchildren, friends, and associates determine the level of joy in our lives. We will be increasingly happy if we and our loved ones are living “after the manner of happiness.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>My dear young friends, have you already established a clear and strong vision for your life that includes the pillars of real happiness and joy? If not, I invite you to do so; if you have, I invite you to embrace your vision with all your heart. It will inspire and guide you in all the critical decisions that you are making during this wonderful season of your life.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a doctrine that will help you reach your righteous desire and yearning for happiness more than anything else. If clearly understood and applied, it will bring joy and tremendous security into your life, independent from any circumstances you may face. This doctrine reaches far beyond this earthly life right into eternity. I am talking about the doctrine of the family.</p>
<h2><b>The Doctrine of the Family</b></h2>
<p>The concept of family and family life as a true source for happiness has been terribly hollowed out in recent decades. The traditional family is under attack from many different sources worldwide. But there are other pitfalls and risks that even relate to some of us who know about the importance, divinity, and eternal destiny of the family. Influenced by the world and its enticements, the increasing desire for self-centered fulfillment, and the inclination for comfort or for making things easy, we put the family and our happiness under stress. All too often happiness in our life is defined by the quality of our “all-around carefree package,” which we hope to achieve and retain in a “low-investment, high-return” mode.</p>
<p>But life does not work in this way. It was never intended to be easy. The Lord said to Joseph Smith: “For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory.”<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>The Lord has clearly revealed how to develop and retain strong families. We all are invited to study and apply the principles set forth in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” Additionally, we need to recognize that drawing personal strength and happiness from family life requires some sacrifice and faith.</p>
<p>The family proclamation states “that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.” It further states “that God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.”<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Among many, the image and purpose of the family has drastically changed. Increasingly, society is adopting the so-called “soul mate” model of marriage, which focuses on the needs and feelings of the adults as opposed to those of the children. As a result, many enter marriage after a long-standing relationship rather than moving forward after an appropriate courtship. Finding the perfect match, testing a relationship by cohabitation without the benefit of marriage, or securing a lavish lifestyle that will be backed by a robust prenuptial agreement have become common practices among many before they even consider marriage.</p>
<p>Scripture and modern-day prophets teach us differently. We build our marriages on the foundation of chastity and fidelity, with the intent to establish and rear a family. The prophet of my youth, President Spencer W. Kimball, taught:</p>
<p><i>The lighted way, then, brings us to normal, clean courting of young men and women, coming eventually to a virtuous union at an altar where a fully authorized servant of God seals the union for eternity. The Hebrew Saints were properly taught, “Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.” (Hebrews 13:4.) </i></p>
<p><i>And to those who might decry marriage or postpone it or forbid it, Paul spoke, condemning them. It is generally selfishness, cold and self-centered, which leads people to shun marriage responsibility. </i></p>
<p>President Kimball continued:</p>
<p><i>There are many who talk and write against marriage. Even some of our own delay marriage and argue against it. . . . We call upon all people to accept normal marriage as a basis for true happiness. . . . Basically marriage presupposes a family. The psalmist said: “Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. . . . Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.” (Psalm 127:3, 5.) </i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1974/04/guidelines-to-carry-forth-the-work-of-god-in-cleanliness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>When Christiane and I were young, these were the words of our living prophet, and we trusted and followed his advice. We knelt across the altar of the Swiss Temple, being only twenty-two and twenty years of age. We were worthy of the covenant, we had no real clue of what to expect, we had no work experience or finished education, and we were as poor as church mice. All that we had in abundance was our love for each other and a lot of naïve enthusiasm. But we began building our world together. We did not postpone having children, and we needed to support each other in getting our educations. We strongly believed in the Lord’s promise that “if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.”<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>And He did. When we married, Christiane was in nursing school. Our vision included having her finish her degree, but at the same time we also made a conscious decision to begin fulfilling our dream of having a family. As a result, our first child was born about two weeks before Christiane passed her final exam as a certified nurse.</p>
<p>However, we knew that even in our marriage there would be stumbling blocks, challenges, and some difficulties. But we had a simple oral agreement, which we often repeated with smiles on our faces: “If difficulties approach, no manslaughter and no divorce.”</p>
<p>Now, thirty-six years later, we are grateful that we could build this family together. Our faith in God and our relationship with each other have become unshaken as we have seen the hand of the Lord guiding us through the process of building our kingdom in mortality, which at present consists of seven children and six grandchildren. This kingdom will continue to grow, forever and ever.</p>
<h2><b>The Importance of Sacrifice</b></h2>
<p>For this vision of happiness we both were ready and willing to sacrifice. We accepted the divinely appointed roles of the father “to preside” and “to provide” and of the mother to “nurture.”<sup>17</sup> Sister Julie B. Beck, former general Relief Society president of the Church, stated:</p>
<p><i>The priesthood role of fathers is to preside and pass priesthood ordinances to the next generation. The priesthood role of mothers is to influence. These are essential, complimentary, and interdependent responsibilities. </i><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Helping one another in a marriage and family as equal partners does not mean that we always do the same things or do everything together or in equal shares. We understand and accept different roles given to us by divine design as outlined in the proclamation on the family. We are not following the world in what is described as “emancipation,” in which both husband and wife live only to fulfill their own self-interests. We are living the principles of complementariness and completion with respect to each other and to our children.</p>
<p>In a BYU devotional address given almost thirty years ago, President James E. Faust counseled the sisters to be careful not to do everything at once and to do first what is most important for the family, and then other desires can follow. He said, “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”<sup>19</sup> Then he said:</p>
<p><i>It seems that the new roles of women have not decreased their responsibility because, while the new roles are challenging, the old roles of wife and mother are in the soul and cry out to be satisfied. . . . Fortunately</i> [in most cases, I would like to add], <i>women do not have to track a career like a man does. A woman may fit more than one career into the various seasons of life. She cannot sing all of the verses of her song at the same time. </i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_message-granddaughters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2><b>Striving for the Ideal</b></h2>
<p>My young friends, some of you may say: “Well, our situation is different. The world today is not ideal. There must be room for exceptions.” With regard to making exceptions, President Boyd K. Packer once told the following story:</p>
<p><i>As mission president, I attended a mission Relief Society conference. Our mission Relief Society president, a relatively recent convert, announced something of a course correction. Some local societies had strayed, and she invited them to conform more closely to the direction set by the general presidency of the Relief Society. </i></p>
<p><i>One sister in the congregation stood and defiantly told her that they were not willing to follow her counsel, saying they were an exception. A bit flustered, she turned to me for help. I didn’t know what to do. I was not interested in facing a fierce woman. So I motioned for her to proceed. Then came the revelation! </i></p>
<p><i>This lovely Relief Society president, small and somewhat handicapped physically, said with gentle firmness: “Dear sister, we’d like not to take care of the exception first. We will take care of the rule first, and then we will see to the exceptions.” The course correction was accepted. </i></p>
<p>President Packer continued:</p>
<p><i>Her advice is good for Relief Society and priesthood and for families. When you state a rule and include the exception in the same sentence, the exception is accepted first.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore I am attempting to teach you the rule or the divine ideal and let you deal with exceptions as you walk the course of your life. In the vision we had for our family, we wanted Christiane to stay home to rear our children. This meant sacrifice. Shortly after we learned that a baby was on its way, Christiane reminded me of the mutual decision we had made even before our wedding day that she would immediately stop working outside the home as soon as a baby was born. I tried to escape what I knew would be additional responsibility by mentioning that she was contributing one-third of our family income. Her simple answer was: “That is your problem. I will take care of the children and you take care of putting food on the table.”</p>
<p>I knew she was right. We had discussed it long before, it was in tune with our vision of family life, it was in tune with the words of the living prophets, and it felt right. So she gave up her well-paying career as a nurse to be close to the children and to meet their daily needs, and I had to get my act together to provide food and shelter. The Lord blessed us to be able to fulfill this aspect of our vision.</p>
<p>Other important matters, such as parenting, teaching, mentoring, cleaning, or even diaper changing, we did together as often as circumstances allowed. This division of labor occurred because it had always been part of how we envisioned our family life.</p>
<h2><b>The Importance of Faith</b></h2>
<p>It requires faith to establish and act upon a vision. But it is only when we move forward in faith that we put ourselves in a position in which the Lord can bless us. A young couple recently shared an experience with me that illustrates this point.</p>
<p>As it had been with Christiane and me, their vision was to begin their family as soon as possible after they were married. They had two criteria for doing so: they needed health insurance and they wanted to be able to care for their baby without using child care.</p>
<p>Not too long after the wife graduated from college, she got a job that provided health insurance and would allow her to work from home. Their plans seemed to have fallen in place exactly as they had hoped, and soon they were expecting their first child. They felt they could both care for the baby between their work and school schedules.</p>
<p>In the summer, the soon-to-be father was looking for an internship in his chosen profession. He had several interviews, but none of them worked out. In October, when his wife was seven months pregnant, she got a call from her boss. The boss informed her that the federal grant that funded her salary would not be renewed. The agency was happy to offer her another job, but she would not be able to work from home. The couple was heartbroken. They thought they had planned well and that the circumstances were perfect for the wife to be able to stay home with the baby.</p>
<p>Several weeks went by, and they adjusted to the idea that they would need to use some form of day care. About three weeks before her December due date, the husband received a call out of the blue from one of the business owners who had interviewed him in the summer. The man said he had just made some new hires and had put a rejection letter in the mail to the husband. But then he had had a very strong feeling that he should hire the husband. The business owner told the young man to ignore the rejection letter, and he then offered him a full-time position with benefits.</p>
<p>In concluding her account of these events, the wife wrote:</p>
<p><i>We were overjoyed. We knew that the Lord had taken a special interest in our desire for me to be a stay-at-home mom. And the Lord’s plan was even better than our plan. If things had gone our way, I would have had to work while caring for our child, but with this new situation I was able to devote my full time and attention to our new baby, which had always been our ultimate goal. </i></p>
<p>Like this young couple, Christiane and I have found that as we have acted in faith and have trusted the Lord, He has helped us to do His will in His way and according to His timing. Now I have to say that His way did not mean that everything turned out immediately the way we thought it would. Sometimes we had to be very patient, sometimes we had to put in some extra effort, and sometimes it even was as if the Lord was testing our seriousness. However, our vision always has inspired us and has been the foundation for our most important decisions.</p>
<h2><b>Look to the Temple</b></h2>
<p>One thing Christiane and I always envisioned was for us to be with our children in the celestial room of a temple as a prelude for the eternal joy and glory we hope one day to experience. Over the past several years we have taken one child after another to receive their temple ordinances, symbolically returning them to our Heavenly Father after teaching them the principles of righteousness.</p>
<p>We just had the last experience of that kind two months ago, when one of our youngest sons entered the temple. We have accompanied three of our children to temple altars as they have married their sweethearts, and we anticipate more temple weddings to come. Nothing has provided more happiness and satisfaction in our lives than the joy we have found in one another and in our posterity. Once we understood that these are just the beginnings of our eternal progression and therefore only the very first levels of our joy and happiness, we were and are continually willing to sacrifice all that we have to live the doctrine of the family and to see our vision fully realized.</p>
<p>I invite you, my dear young friends, to ponder this doctrine and come to know for yourselves what really matters most. This type of happiness is at the heart of our existence. And happiness that stems from congenial relationships among husband, wife, and children is always growing and increasing.</p>
<h2><b>Be Serious About What Matters Most</b></h2>
<p>There is one more thing that you need to do after you have studied the doctrine of the family and have established a vision for your happiness. You have to become serious about implementing your vision. I would like to share an additional lesson from my personal experience.</p>
<p>The first initial rejections I received in my courtship with Christiane made me a little discouraged. I had just about decided to begin a fruitful career as a young single adult in the Church. One day I had a special spiritual impression. I was participating in an ordinance in the Swiss Temple when I heard a voice in my heart saying something to this effect: “Erich, if you do not seriously strive to marry and enter into the new and everlasting covenant, all these teachings and promised blessings really make no difference for you.” It was a wake-up call that I received at the very young age of twenty-one, and from that moment I tried even harder to be worthy of that blessing.</p>
<p>I invite you to set personal goals regarding your vision. In <i>Preach My Gospel</i> we read:</p>
<p><i>Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can accomplish. Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith.</i><sup>22</sup></p>
<p>I invite you to be serious. Do not trifle with sacred things. Once you reach a marriageable age, don’t just date for fun. Never compromise your eternal birthright by doing anything that would deprive you of making the most important covenants in the temple. As you treat every date as a potential eternal companion, you will never do inappropriate things that would physically or spiritually harm your date or compromise your own worthiness and darken your vision. Your spiritual perception will never be dimmed and you will always be entitled to the whisperings of the Spirit. He will encourage and confirm as you make these most important decisions in your life, even if at times you are scared to death.</p>
<p>Hold yourself accountable to the Lord with respect to your vision and goals in life. If there is something you need to repent of, don’t hesitate a second to do so. Both this life and eternal life are too important to procrastinate the day of our repentance. Follow the invitation of the Savior, who encouraged us to</p>
<p><i>ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.</i><sup>23</sup></p>
<h2><b>The Principle of Finishing</b></h2>
<p>I would like to share a thought with those of you who are trying hard to implement these principles but have not yet succeeded. I recognize that some of you, given your circumstances, may need to adapt the ideal vision of a family to fit your personal situation. But I have learned that the Lord will help us as we act in faith and follow the ideal to the extent possible.</p>
<p>The gospel of Jesus Christ includes a most comforting component. It is the “finishing” or “completing” aspect of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Moroni admonished us to always stay on the right way, “relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who [is] the author and the finisher of [our] faith.”<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>Because of the faith that we have in Jesus Christ, we can pursue the course in life we need to take, but if we fail because of weakness or missing opportunities, He will either reach out to us or fill in the gap and become the finisher of our faith. It is He who stated, “For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.”<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>And from the Church Handbook we read:</p>
<p><i>Faithful members whose circumstances do not allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life will receive all promised blessings in the eternities, provided they keep the covenants they have made with God.</i><sup>26</sup></p>
<p>I testify that the Lord meant what He said when He stated that “it is not good that the man should be alone”<sup>27</sup> and that His ultimate desire for all of His children is that they receive “a fulness of joy.”<sup>28</sup> Therefore, always keep your vision before you and</p>
<p><i>strive for the ideal of living in an eternal family. This means preparing to become worthy spouses and loving fathers or mothers. In some cases these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all.</i><sup>29</sup></p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of my remarks I promised you the direct “German approach.” So please do not be offended at what I have said. I know there are as many different life circumstances as there are people in this room. I know there are differences in cultures, traditions, and expectations. However, the doctrines and principles outlined today are eternal and true, and they stand independent from our personal life situations. I have every confidence that as you sincerely ponder and prayerfully consider your personal vision in the context of these doctrines and principles, you will be able to develop a vision for your life that will be pleasing to the Lord and lead to your greatest happiness.</p>
<p>I testify of these wonderful truths. God lives; Jesus is the Christ. It is through the plan of the Father and the Atonement of Jesus Christ that we have access to such marvelous opportunities for happiness in this life and promises of a future in which our individual kingdoms will be expanded beyond our current capacity to fully understand. So, once more I ask you: What is your vision for <i>your</i> life? and What are you willing to do to achieve it?</p>
<p>I pray the blessings of heaven on you as you ponder these questions and strive to obtain sacred and eternal blessings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your ­family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on—and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy—one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of God’s plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch—choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.2
With this gift of time, you won’t always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what ­happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Deter­mine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We can’t refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, “With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor.”
Then my daughter exclaimed, “What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!”
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xi’an Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, “Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well.” Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer—now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater—in Chinese, “the mother school.”
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, “As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them.”
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto “Go forth to serve” has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, “go forth to serve” could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of one’s undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you—graduates, parents, and other supporters—thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: “Wow! So how do those fit together?” In some ways they don’t. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests—like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life” (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn’t end, the quest doesn’t end, and our relationships don’t end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didn’t know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: “Believe in yourself as I believe in you.” It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together (“Believe in Yourself,” The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
