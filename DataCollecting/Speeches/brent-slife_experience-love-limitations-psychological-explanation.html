  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It may not surprise you, but I want to declare at the outset that I have been multiply blessed. I want to initially mention an important blessing - this university - and then I would like to dwell&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;on a forty-one-year blessing - my marriage. Those who have received this award in past years have stood here to express their gratitude to BYU, but I feel especially blessed in receiving this award as a non-Mormon. This university has insisted on valuing me regardless of my religious minority status. I am a religious "other," yet this university has not only accepted me as a colleague and a friend but also persisted in recognizing me and celebrating my work. I think this is a sort of minor miracle. As you will see in the case of my wife, I honestly believe that when we truly value and even love those who are "other" in some way, God is there.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

I also want to acknowledge how important this university has been to my academic work. I have long desired to actively interface the sacred and the secular - the sacredness of my faith and the secularity of my discipline of psychology - but there are few places that permit this work. BYU, however, has not only welcomed this type of scholarship but also encouraged and facilitated it. For this reason, I have never had to compartmentalize my Christianity away from my discipline; I have been able to integrate the two - which has been an incredible blessing to me!

As I mentioned, however, the blessing I want to dwell on today is the love I feel for my wife. But discussing such a personal experience may seem a bit strange for a psychologist. Psychologists are supposed to deal with objective data.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Unfortunately, love isnt objective, so psychologys knowledge of love has been meager over the years. Consider renowned love researcher Harry Harlow and his lament in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association:

&lt;i&gt;So far as love or affection is concerned, psychologists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple observation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

This conclusion was stated many years ago, but it is not unusual for even modern investigators of love to echo Harlows lament. Zick Rubin, for example, believes that some progress has been made, but he comments that love has "seemed safely beyond the research scientists ever-extending grasp."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

I wont get into psychological methods here. Suffice it to say that a relatively new brand of psychological method - qualitative investigation - was specifically set up to study subjective experiences. And qualitative investigators are not afraid of even just one persons experiences, especially when those personal experiences teach us something about the phenomenon of interest.

As a marital therapist of thirty-five years, I have long realized the great blessing of my love for Karen. I know that everyone is supposed to love their spouse, but I dont just love my wife; I am still &lt;i&gt;in love&lt;/i&gt; with her. I love the way she stands, the way she walks, and the way she talks, even after all these years. And it turns out that I am not the only one who feels this form of love. Qualitative research indicates that there are many whom I will typify with my personal experiences today.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, I dont doubt that many of you will see yourselves in my description.

My purpose today is not to romanticize this love. Instead, my desire is to understand it, at least to some degree. As I interface the sacred and the secular, I am struck by how little my experience of this love is explainable in conventional psychological terms, or, indeed, in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; secular terms. And I am not merely intellectually curious about this issue. As a marital therapist, an understanding of love would help me to address the problem marriages I hope to heal. Why is my marriage thriving while other marriages are dying?

My presentation today will first attempt to describe why I believe several aspects of psychological explanation make little sense of what I experience in my love for Karen. The presentation will then turn to philosopher Jean-Luc Marion, who seems to think outside the explanatory box on this particular topic.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; As I will describe, Marion agrees with me that the ideas underlying our current ways of thinking about love dont inform us about what it is. Indeed, he is clear that these current ideas serve instead to drain away any meaning that could resemble what most of us experience as love.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love of Karen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Allow me to begin with some background information on Karen and myself. Like people in a lot of marriages, we could not be more different. Karen is one of those sweet and generally enthusiastic people. Shes the kind of person whose only question in writing personal notes is how many exclamation points to put at the end of a sentence. Shes also a uniquely loving person; shes very other-centered - very aware of the needs of those around her. As for me, I believe that I can safely say that I am more I-centered - more egoistic. I am certainly not sweet and certainly not naturally loving. I could cite witnesses from my family of origin as evidence, but suffice it to say that there is no evidence that I could love someone over the long haul.

Yet my experience is precisely the opposite. My love for Karen has lasted more than forty years and has endured amazing changes in our identities, bodies, and situations. And, as I mentioned, this love is not some abstract "I care about her"; it is the beguiled and captivated kind of love that many seem to lose after the honeymoon period of marriage. I am still excited at her touch and her presence. I thrill in holding her hand, sitting beside her, or kissing her. And if you are a student in one of my classes, you have to put up with me talking about her - because I like to so much!

For example, I constantly experience how cute she is. I dont quite know what I mean when I say "cute" here, but I know that she feels entirely special and dear to me - like a one-of-a-kind person whose attractiveness never flags. This is not to say that my experience of her cuteness is always good for our relationship. When shes angry at me, I think shes cute, which gets me into trouble. When shes sad, I think shes cute, which gets me into trouble. When shes hurt, all I want to do is apologize, even if I have no clue how I have hurt her, which can also get me into trouble. You would think that a psychotherapist would have a little more emotional intelligence, wouldnt you? But its out the window with Karen. When my students ask how I might diagnose her, I reply without skipping a beat: "Severely cute."

And this is my first problem with conventional explanations: How can my love last so long, across so many changes, and with me as an egoistic lover? Psychologys theories can explain me when I am egoistic but not when I am truly loving her. Egoism assumes that we are all ultimately watching out for "number one." Our motives and goals are fundamentally those that benefit us in some way or another. True to this egoism, all the conventional theories of psychology fall into line: psychoanalysts talk about the ego benefiting from pleasure, behaviorists tell us how we are ultimately motivated by rewards, and humanists discuss &lt;i&gt;self-&lt;/i&gt;actualization rather than &lt;i&gt;other-&lt;/i&gt;actualization.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Even the social interactions that many economists discuss are egoistic.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; From their perspective, we would be irrational without some type of self-benefit motivating our interactions. This is part of the reason so many psychologists assume that mutual self-benefit, a kind of business transaction, is the best we can do in marriage, where I wont scratch your back until I am reasonably sure you will scratch mine. These mutual self-benefit relationships are certainly what the vast majority of social scientists expect, and I clearly see these types of "calculator" marriages in my practice, where spouses are angry because they have given six units of love today and their spouse has provided only four.

The difficulty with this egoistic understanding of relationships is that I experience none of it in my love for Karen - over four decades of time! My experience just doesnt seem like the kind of thing most psychologists would predict. I experience my behavior with her as almost completely &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;selfish. And perhaps most astounding to me, I experience my unselfishness toward her as &lt;i&gt;easy - &lt;/i&gt;even easier than being selfish. I dont want you to think that I am knighting myself here; my egoistic sense of myself is still intact, except&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;for those I love. My point here is that conventional explanations do not predict or even render as plausible my loving behaviors.

A second problem for conventional explanations concerns the "others" of our lives, those who are unlike us for whatever reason - a different race, gender, religion, or political persuasion. Psychologists have an international conference called Psychology and the Other that is devoted to this problem because otherness is viewed as disruptive to relationships. My students seem to feel this problem because they fear otherness when they are looking for dates and eventual marital partners. They look, instead, for a match - a set of similarities - as the dating website Match.com exemplifies. Our culture and my discipline tend to view similarities - not differences - among people as the fundamental bonding agent of relationships. Even communities and organizations are typically thought to be unified through common beliefs and values, with differences in beliefs and values frequently viewed as threats to the community.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

But again, this emphasis on similarities is not my experience in my relationship with Karen. As many marital partners will tell you, they cannot imagine someone more different from them than their spouse. And when I hear my friends or clients describe this otherness, it almost always points to problems in their relationships. Yet nothing could be further from the truth in my experience with Karen. Indeed, her extreme otherness from me feels like the spice of our marriage, the really good stuff. She and I can experience the same hike or discussion and come away with dramatically differing perceptions, yet I experience these differences with her as delightful. How is my delight possible, given the so-called problem of otherness and our cultures emphasis on similarity?

None of this is to say that Karen and I dont fight, argue, or generally conflict. How could you really be "other"&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;than someone and not conflict? It is to say, instead, that our love disallows the conflict from being threatening. Unlike most secular understandings of relationships, I experience my love for her not &lt;i&gt;in spite of &lt;/i&gt;her otherness but &lt;i&gt;because &lt;/i&gt;of it. Conflict, in this sense, feels more like a kind of intimacy. Its hard to be angry with someone you dont care about. In conflict I have the privilege of getting to know the person &lt;i&gt;through &lt;/i&gt;the interaction. Imagine how our world would be if we stopped seeing differences as obstacles to relationships but rather saw them as the healthy tension that can promote character, deepen intimacy, and kindle friendship.

These few snippets of my experience with Karen say nothing about other facets of psychological explanations, such as their abstractness, their amorality, and their determinism. I dont have time today, but I believe I could demonstrate how each of these facets of explanation also&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;hinders efforts to understand love. And, honestly, I dont experience laypersons faring much better in attempting to explain their love. My clients will routinely challenge their spouses to tell them why they love them. Yet the most articulate and educated of spouses inevitably sense the inadequacy of their answers. This is surely the reason so many of us resort to poetry or ballads; the usual cultural explanations of our loving relationships appear to be just as empty as psychological explanations.

As I mentioned at the outset, I believe that the French philosopher Jean-Luc Marion comes to our rescue.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; And, as it happens, Marion agrees with me about the unexplainability of love. He demonstrates that this unexplainability is not just the phenomenon of love but also the inadequacy of our cultural and philosophical frameworks for comprehending love. Specifically, he believes that we are using the wrong ideas to understand our relationships with other people.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descartes on Self&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;These wrong ideas, Marion argues, were popularized by the great philosopher Rene Descartes. We cannot overestimate the influence of this philosopher on our basic understandings of our relationships with others. Most everyone has probably heard Descartess famous proposition "I think, therefore I am,"&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; in which he equated the thinking-I, the rational self, with our identity. Marion sees this proposition as a symptom of a framework for the self that messes up our understanding of love, that indeed makes it unexplainable.

A pivotal part of this Cartesian framework is that the thinking-I, the self, exists separately from other people. After all, I dont need other people in order to think, so my basic identity has little to do with other people or even the world around me. I am who I am &lt;i&gt;without &lt;/i&gt;you and the world. And when I do perceive the world, it is a mere perception or representation of that world; it is not the world itself. When I lovingly perceive Karen, I am not experiencing the real person; I am experiencing my representation of her. And there is all sorts of evidence that our mental representations dont always correspond to the person whom our image is supposed to represent. The sweet and loving person I am describing to you right now may not be the authentic Karen at all but merely my mental image of her, which I control to some degree.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; These representations are called many things in psychology - mental sets, scripts, stereotypes, or schemas - but they all function in the spirit of this Cartesian sense of the self.

An important implication of this Cartesian view of the self, according to Marion, is that we are all in a world of our own representations. It makes sense from this perspective that we would all be egoistic, because everything in our world is basically &lt;i&gt;us - &lt;/i&gt;the things we control and the things we want. My representation of Karen is itself egoistic because it has more to do with me than with Karen.&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; It is how I &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to think of her rather than how she &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;is. Descartess rationality, in this sense, functions solely for my benefit.&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; We are, in effect, naturally selfish, because any self in Descartess scheme would maximize the benefits of its representations, which, as I mentioned, is the assumption of many economists.

This selfishness means, of course, that I am not really capable of acting in Karens best interest, especially&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;if her best interest conflicts with my own. I am more likely to use&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Karen and treat her as a means to my own ends, which is consonant with much of positive psychology, where others exist primarily to make us happy.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Many marriage researchers see this selfish mode as the primary cause of our high divorce rate:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; we see marriage as a means to our individual happiness, not as an end in itself. The bottom line for Marion here is that Descartess understanding of the self makes truly gracious love impossible - not just unexplainable - because truly loving someone means treating them as&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;an end, not as a means, and our Cartesian selfishness always makes the self the end. The best we can do in Descartess framework is to use each other for mutual benefit.

But if all humans are doomed to our own represented&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;world, according to Descartes, how do we function in the real&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;world? Many clinical psychologists might answer this question with one word: &lt;i&gt;poorly.&lt;/i&gt; Consider how many of us go through the day experiencing all kinds of misunderstandings with other people. This is because the parts of the real&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;world that dont fit our represented&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;world rarely change our representations. Because &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; control my representation of Karen, her actual self in the real world cant disrupt my little represented world.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Her otherness in the real world wont necessarily alter my stereotype of her. In fact, Descartes predicts that I will make her otherness into the enemy. I will focus on how she is similar to my stereotype of her. This is the reason people want their spouses to be similar to them. Similarities best fit our represented world.

Now, to give Descartes credit, his understanding of self and others makes sense of a lot of my experiences, and this is surely why this understanding is so prevalent in psychology. Still, the question I am raising today is, why doesnt Descartess understanding make sense of my experiences of love? As I have described, I experience none of these implications of his understanding of the self. I am not the selfish dolt that Descartes would predict. I also experience a lot of otherness with Karen, but I experience it not as an enemy of my self and my control. Indeed, I willingly give up my control, allowing for the disruption of my represented world, because of my delight in her otherness. I guess I could be deceiving myself about my unselfishness and my delight, but this deception doesnt account for my other more egoistic relationships, which I apparently see quite clearly. It also doesnt account for those who experience this same type of love - perhaps many of you. What is it, then, about this gracious love that leads us to be so different in these loving interactions?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marion on Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Although Marion agrees with Descartes on many things, he presents a markedly different understanding of the self. Perhaps first is Marions contention that not everything we experience is representable,&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; with love being one of those things.&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Gracious love is what he considers a "saturated" experience.&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Saturation occurs when an experience touches us so deeply that we cant explain or even fathom it. Have you ever witnessed such a stunning sunset that you cant find the words to describe it? Gracious love is similar. It is saturated so much that our experience of it is more than we can grasp or contain in a representation.&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

Here Marion hits the nail on the head for me. My experience of Karens love is so luminous and so glorious that it feels unearthly. This is the reason we become tongue-tied when trying to explain or justify our love for another. It is the reason we recite poetry or croon love songs.

But why &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;love so difficult to grasp? Gracious love is gracious for Marion because it is never deserved or rational in the conventional sense;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; it is a pure gift without strings attached, logical justifications, or ulterior motives. Again, this feels right to me in my relationship with Karen. I naturally sense that I dont deserve her love.&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Unlike the Cartesian approach, in which everyone &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;deserve the love they receive from the benefits they provide, love from Marions perspective cannot be controlled through reciprocal benefit and is &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; truly deserved or justified. Love literally defies conventional logic. Indeed, it is so illogical that Marion believes we are incapable of giving such a pure gift without getting one ourselves - Gods gift of Jesus Christ.&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Only a truly grateful heart, a heart that has already experienced the Purest of Gifts, can truly love someone in this manner.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

As the philosopher Paul Woodruff describes so well, the only proper response to that which is above or beyond us is reverence.&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; When I come face-to-face with a saturated experience - the wonder of a babys birth, the illumination of a spiritual insight - the only realistic response is a profound honoring of and appreciation for it. This is the reason for my use of the term "blessed" when describing my marriage; our love feels sacred to me, like one of my main duties in life is to reverently protect and nurture it. Miroslav Volf puts it this way: "We enjoy things the most when we experience them as sacraments - as carriers of the presence of another."&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;

Gracious love, then, is so "other" - so above and beyond - that it doesnt fit our stereotype or representation of the world.&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; It throws us; it knocks us off our egoistic thrones as controllers of our own little universe.&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; This is the reason we feel so vulnerable when we love. Our egoistic world is put in jeopardy. There is someone &lt;i&gt;else &lt;/i&gt;in our world, some "other" who matters to me besides me. Karens differences from me, then, are not &lt;i&gt;outside &lt;/i&gt;of my love, as if they are foreign or threatening. They are &lt;i&gt;within &lt;/i&gt;and an essential part of my love, even when they exceed my understanding. This excess could, in fact, be the secret of our loves duration across the span of our marriage. Our love is never familiar or predictable, so it can never be staid or boring. Indeed, it fills me with a kind of everyday reverence that I strive to honor and appreciate.

We are also no longer separate selves in the Cartesian sense. My relationship with Karen, because of this saturated experience of love, is part of my very identity. This relationship helps to constitute who I am. I have a kind of shared being with her - perhaps even "one flesh," as the scriptures teach us.&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; You all know about the old couple who finish each others sentences. Marion puts it this way: "I am [only] insofar as I love and [am loved]."&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; How, then, can I be selfish or use her to my own ends when she is part of me?&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And Marion doesnt believe that she merely enters my world; my love for her serves as a bridge to the real world, where I dont always get what I want. Im not the king or the ultimate controller in the real world. In this sense, Marion doesnt just believe that love is required for good relationships; he believes that gracious love is required to be &lt;i&gt;in touch with reality&lt;/i&gt;.

In fact, it is only when we are in touch with this loving reality that we can truly develop as selves. We were reminded of the need for gracious love in 1989 when severely neglected orphans were discovered in Romania.&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; Infants simply cannot thrive without gracious love.&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; I say &lt;i&gt;gracious&lt;/i&gt; love specifically because infants never do anything to deserve the love of their caretakers; infants just &lt;i&gt;are,&lt;/i&gt; in all their otherness from us. There is no reciprocity with infants, no business transaction; we love them because of who they are. With infants, an experience with a gracious caregiver is a saturated experience, one that breaks through their mental representations and invites them into the real world. Marions understanding of love, for this reason, explains why gracious love is central not only to our mental health but also to our initial and continuing growth as people.

American poet Christian Wiman seems to capture some of the spirit of Marions account and my own experience of Karen when he writes about falling in love with his own wife:

&lt;i&gt;Not only was that gray veil between me and the world ripped aside, colors aching back into things, but all the particulars of the world suddenly seemed in excess of themselves, and thus more truly themselves. We, too, were part of this enlargement: it was as if our love demanded some expression beyond the blissful intensity our two lives made. I thought for years that any love had to be limiting, that it was a zero-sum game: what you gave with one part of yourself had to be taken from another. In fact, the great paradox of love, and not just romantic love, is that a closer focus may go hand in hand with a broadened scope.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;So what, in conclusion, are the practical implications of Marions understanding of love for our everyday lives? What lessons can we draw? I ask you to consider ten such lessons.

1. Love is to some degree ungraspable, so dont get upset when your spouses description of his or her love is inadequate.

2. Love isnt deserved; its a gift. We dont deserve true gifts; otherwise its not a gift at all - its a business transaction. We dont ask true givers to justify their gifts. We accept them humbly, enjoy them, respond with gratefulness, and then give gifts to others who dont deserve them, like us.

3. Avoid "calculator relationships," in which we keep track of units of love given to one another. If were keeping track of them, they arent units of love at all.

4. You dont love someone so they can be happy. Love isnt the means to something else; its the end. The quality of your relationship is the main thing, not the emotional satisfaction of the individuals in the relationships.

5. Love is widely recognized as crucial to mental health, but psychologists typically interpret it as an instrument of individual happiness rather than a crucial pathway out of our egoistic world.

6. Unlike egoistic theories of the social sciences, we are completely capable of unselfishness, whether it is love of a country or love of a person. And, perhaps surprisingly, true unselfishness isnt necessarily experienced as sacrificial, because the other who is loved is literally part of us.

7. Otherness is not the enemy or disrupter of relationships. Loving someone who is different can make us vulnerable, but this vulnerability is part of us giving up control and getting in touch with the real world.

8. When otherness is not the enemy, marital conflicts are less threatening and more productive.

9. The otherness of gracious love is pivotal to our initial and continuing development as persons.

10. Otherness ultimately becomes the spice of our relationships; loving similarities solely is akin to loving a mirror image of ourselves, which is just another kind of selfishness.

These, I believe, are some of the lessons of Marion. I hope they bless your lives as they have mine.

12. With Descartes, love is reduced to a representation of an object for which one feels passion (see Marion, &lt;i&gt;Cartesian Questions&lt;/i&gt;, 13132).

13. The cognitive ego makes an alter ego impossible (see Marion, &lt;i&gt;Cartesian Questions,&lt;/i&gt; 13132).

14. The ego for Descartes loves only the self. Even charity is interpreted as self-affection (see Marion, &lt;i&gt;Cartesian Questions,&lt;/i&gt; 112).

15. See Blaine J. Fowers, "Instrumentalism and Psychology: Beyond Using and Being Used," &lt;i&gt;Theory and Psychology &lt;/i&gt;20, no. 1 (February 2010): 10224.

16. See Blaine J. Fowers, &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Myth of Marital Happiness: How Embracing the Virtues of Loyalty, Generosity, Justice, and Courage Can Strengthen Your Relationship&lt;/i&gt; (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2000).

17. "The Cartesian &lt;i&gt;intuitus&lt;/i&gt; . . . controls its objects and imposes an order on them" (Christina M. Gschwandtner, &lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion: Exceeding Metaphysics&lt;/i&gt; [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007], 227). In Marions view, by contrast, "I am not in control" (Gschwandtner, &lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion,&lt;/i&gt; 221).

18. By "experience" here I do not mean my own "consciousness," because this is still what I am calling here a representation and thus a reduction to an "object," which for Marion eliminates any possibility of love. "Love as a figure of consciousness always ends up in self-idolatry" (Gschwandtner, &lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion,&lt;/i&gt; 231). By experience of a truly other (Karen), I mean that I must allow her own intentionality, her own agency, and her own "counter-current of consciousness" (Marion, &lt;i&gt;Prolegomena to Charity,&lt;/i&gt; 82).

19. Marions &lt;i&gt;Prolegomena to Charity &lt;/i&gt;(specifically chapter 4) was written in homage to Emmanuel Levinas (see also Levinas, &lt;i&gt;Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority,&lt;/i&gt; trans. Alphonso Lingis [Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969]).

20. "I discover myself lovable through the others grace" (Marion, &lt;i&gt;Phenomenon,&lt;/i&gt; 213).

21. "The instability of [loving] phenomena thus never comes from a poverty of intuition, but instead from the opposite: from my incapacity to assign to it a precise signification that is individualized and stable" (Marion, &lt;i&gt;Phenomenon,&lt;/i&gt; 96). "The beloved therefore emerges not as [a Cartesian] object, but as a . . . saturated phenomenon" (Gschwandtner, &lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion,&lt;/i&gt; 234).

22. "Love lacks neither reason nor logic; quite simply, it does not admit reason or logic other than its own" (Marion, &lt;i&gt;Phenomenon,&lt;/i&gt; 217).

23. See Kyle Hubbard, "The Unity of Eros and Agape: On Jean-Luc Marions &lt;i&gt;Erotic Phenomenon,&lt;/i&gt;" &lt;i&gt;Essays in Philosophy &lt;/i&gt;12, no. 1 (January 2011), 13046.

24. "All human love originates in this divine source" (Gschwandtner, &lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion&lt;/i&gt;, 241).

25. Marion argues, for example, that "charity discovers and introduces new phenomena into the world itself and the conceptual universe, which are saturated with meaning and glory, which ordain and eventually save the world" ("Christian Philosophy," 261). Only in his more recent work on the erotic phenomenon (see &lt;i&gt;Phenomenon&lt;/i&gt;) does he attempt to rid himself of theological contamination, which Gschwandtner ultimately disputes (see &lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion,&lt;/i&gt; 233).

26. See Paul Woodruff, &lt;i&gt;Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue &lt;/i&gt;(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001).

27. Miroslav Volf, &lt;i&gt;Flourishing: Why We Need Religion in a Globalized World&lt;/i&gt; (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2015), 204.

28. As Gschwandtner notes, "The Cartesian ego here loses control not just over other objects but even over itself" (&lt;i&gt;Reading Jean-Luc Marion,&lt;/i&gt; 237).

29. To become a self in this manner is to become a me that is "uncovered, stripped bare, decentered" (Marion, &lt;i&gt;Prolegomena,&lt;/i&gt; 84).

30. For example, Genesis 2:24.

31. Marion, &lt;i&gt;Phenomenon,&lt;/i&gt; 195.

32. Similar to Levinas (see &lt;i&gt;Totality and Infinity&lt;/i&gt;), love goes beyond the universality and abstractness of deontological ethics, and it issues an ethical call for the particular other. Only love, in fact, can concretize and individualize the face of the other.

33. See Mary Battiata, "Despite Aid, Romanian Children Face Bleak Lives," &lt;i&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/i&gt; 7 January 1991, A1, A20.

			<p>It may not surprise you, but I want to declare at the outset that I have been multiply blessed. I want to initially mention an important blessing - this university - and then I would like to dwell<i> </i>on a forty-one-year blessing - my marriage. Those who have received this award in past years have stood here to express their gratitude to BYU, but I feel especially blessed in receiving this award as a non-Mormon. This university has insisted on valuing me regardless of my religious minority status. I am a religious "other," yet this university has not only accepted me as a colleague and a friend but also persisted in recognizing me and celebrating my work. I think this is a sort of minor miracle. As you will see in the case of my wife, I honestly believe that when we truly value and even love those who are "other" in some way, God is there.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge how important this university has been to my academic work. I have long desired to actively interface the sacred and the secular - the sacredness of my faith and the secularity of my discipline of psychology - but there are few places that permit this work. BYU, however, has not only welcomed this type of scholarship but also encouraged and facilitated it. For this reason, I have never had to compartmentalize my Christianity away from my discipline; I have been able to integrate the two - which has been an incredible blessing to me!</p>
<p>As I mentioned, however, the blessing I want to dwell on today is the love I feel for my wife. But discussing such a personal experience may seem a bit strange for a psychologist. Psychologists are supposed to deal with objective data.<sup>2</sup> Unfortunately, love isnt objective, so psychologys knowledge of love has been meager over the years. Consider renowned love researcher Harry Harlow and his lament in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association:</p>
<p><i>So far as love or affection is concerned, psychologists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple observation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>This conclusion was stated many years ago, but it is not unusual for even modern investigators of love to echo Harlows lament. Zick Rubin, for example, believes that some progress has been made, but he comments that love has "seemed safely beyond the research scientists ever-extending grasp."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>I wont get into psychological methods here. Suffice it to say that a relatively new brand of psychological method - qualitative investigation - was specifically set up to study subjective experiences. And qualitative investigators are not afraid of even just one persons experiences, especially when those personal experiences teach us something about the phenomenon of interest.</p>
<p>As a marital therapist of thirty-five years, I have long realized the great blessing of my love for Karen. I know that everyone is supposed to love their spouse, but I dont just love my wife; I am still <i>in love</i> with her. I love the way she stands, the way she walks, and the way she talks, even after all these years. And it turns out that I am not the only one who feels this form of love. Qualitative research indicates that there are many whom I will typify with my personal experiences today.<sup>5</sup> Indeed, I dont doubt that many of you will see yourselves in my description.</p>
<p>My purpose today is not to romanticize this love. Instead, my desire is to understand it, at least to some degree. As I interface the sacred and the secular, I am struck by how little my experience of this love is explainable in conventional psychological terms, or, indeed, in <i>any</i> secular terms. And I am not merely intellectually curious about this issue. As a marital therapist, an understanding of love would help me to address the problem marriages I hope to heal. Why is my marriage thriving while other marriages are dying?</p>
<p>My presentation today will first attempt to describe why I believe several aspects of psychological explanation make little sense of what I experience in my love for Karen. The presentation will then turn to philosopher Jean-Luc Marion, who seems to think outside the explanatory box on this particular topic.<sup>6</sup> As I will describe, Marion agrees with me that the ideas underlying our current ways of thinking about love dont inform us about what it is. Indeed, he is clear that these current ideas serve instead to drain away any meaning that could resemble what most of us experience as love.</p>
<h2><b>Love of Karen</b></h2>
<p><b> </b>Allow me to begin with some background information on Karen and myself. Like people in a lot of marriages, we could not be more different. Karen is one of those sweet and generally enthusiastic people. Shes the kind of person whose only question in writing personal notes is how many exclamation points to put at the end of a sentence. Shes also a uniquely loving person; shes very other-centered - very aware of the needs of those around her. As for me, I believe that I can safely say that I am more I-centered - more egoistic. I am certainly not sweet and certainly not naturally loving. I could cite witnesses from my family of origin as evidence, but suffice it to say that there is no evidence that I could love someone over the long haul.</p>
<p>Yet my experience is precisely the opposite. My love for Karen has lasted more than forty years and has endured amazing changes in our identities, bodies, and situations. And, as I mentioned, this love is not some abstract "I care about her"; it is the beguiled and captivated kind of love that many seem to lose after the honeymoon period of marriage. I am still excited at her touch and her presence. I thrill in holding her hand, sitting beside her, or kissing her. And if you are a student in one of my classes, you have to put up with me talking about her - because I like to so much!</p>
<p>For example, I constantly experience how cute she is. I dont quite know what I mean when I say "cute" here, but I know that she feels entirely special and dear to me - like a one-of-a-kind person whose attractiveness never flags. This is not to say that my experience of her cuteness is always good for our relationship. When shes angry at me, I think shes cute, which gets me into trouble. When shes sad, I think shes cute, which gets me into trouble. When shes hurt, all I want to do is apologize, even if I have no clue how I have hurt her, which can also get me into trouble. You would think that a psychotherapist would have a little more emotional intelligence, wouldnt you? But its out the window with Karen. When my students ask how I might diagnose her, I reply without skipping a beat: "Severely cute."</p>
<p>And this is my first problem with conventional explanations: How can my love last so long, across so many changes, and with me as an egoistic lover? Psychologys theories can explain me when I am egoistic but not when I am truly loving her. Egoism assumes that we are all ultimately watching out for "number one." Our motives and goals are fundamentally those that benefit us in some way or another. True to this egoism, all the conventional theories of psychology fall into line: psychoanalysts talk about the ego benefiting from pleasure, behaviorists tell us how we are ultimately motivated by rewards, and humanists discuss <i>self-</i>actualization rather than <i>other-</i>actualization.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Even the social interactions that many economists discuss are egoistic.<sup>8</sup> From their perspective, we would be irrational without some type of self-benefit motivating our interactions. This is part of the reason so many psychologists assume that mutual self-benefit, a kind of business transaction, is the best we can do in marriage, where I wont scratch your back until I am reasonably sure you will scratch mine. These mutual self-benefit relationships are certainly what the vast majority of social scientists expect, and I clearly see these types of "calculator" marriages in my practice, where spouses are angry because they have given six units of love today and their spouse has provided only four.</p>
<p>The difficulty with this egoistic understanding of relationships is that I experience none of it in my love for Karen - over four decades of time! My experience just doesnt seem like the kind of thing most psychologists would predict. I experience my behavior with her as almost completely <i>un</i>selfish. And perhaps most astounding to me, I experience my unselfishness toward her as <i>easy - </i>even easier than being selfish. I dont want you to think that I am knighting myself here; my egoistic sense of myself is still intact, except<i> </i>for those I love. My point here is that conventional explanations do not predict or even render as plausible my loving behaviors.</p>
<p>A second problem for conventional explanations concerns the "others" of our lives, those who are unlike us for whatever reason - a different race, gender, religion, or political persuasion. Psychologists have an international conference called Psychology and the Other that is devoted to this problem because otherness is viewed as disruptive to relationships. My students seem to feel this problem because they fear otherness when they are looking for dates and eventual marital partners. They look, instead, for a match - a set of similarities - as the dating website Match.com exemplifies. Our culture and my discipline tend to view similarities - not differences - among people as the fundamental bonding agent of relationships. Even communities and organizations are typically thought to be unified through common beliefs and values, with differences in beliefs and values frequently viewed as threats to the community.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>But again, this emphasis on similarities is not my experience in my relationship with Karen. As many marital partners will tell you, they cannot imagine someone more different from them than their spouse. And when I hear my friends or clients describe this otherness, it almost always points to problems in their relationships. Yet nothing could be further from the truth in my experience with Karen. Indeed, her extreme otherness from me feels like the spice of our marriage, the really good stuff. She and I can experience the same hike or discussion and come away with dramatically differing perceptions, yet I experience these differences with her as delightful. How is my delight possible, given the so-called problem of otherness and our cultures emphasis on similarity?</p>
<p>None of this is to say that Karen and I dont fight, argue, or generally conflict. How could you really be "other"<i> </i>than someone and not conflict? It is to say, instead, that our love disallows the conflict from being threatening. Unlike most secular understandings of relationships, I experience my love for her not <i>in spite of </i>her otherness but <i>because </i>of it. Conflict, in this sense, feels more like a kind of intimacy. Its hard to be angry with someone you dont care about. In conflict I have the privilege of getting to know the person <i>through </i>the interaction. Imagine how our world would be if we stopped seeing differences as obstacles to relationships but rather saw them as the healthy tension that can promote character, deepen intimacy, and kindle friendship.</p>
<p>These few snippets of my experience with Karen say nothing about other facets of psychological explanations, such as their abstractness, their amorality, and their determinism. I dont have time today, but I believe I could demonstrate how each of these facets of explanation also<i> </i>hinders efforts to understand love. And, honestly, I dont experience laypersons faring much better in attempting to explain their love. My clients will routinely challenge their spouses to tell them why they love them. Yet the most articulate and educated of spouses inevitably sense the inadequacy of their answers. This is surely the reason so many of us resort to poetry or ballads; the usual cultural explanations of our loving relationships appear to be just as empty as psychological explanations.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the outset, I believe that the French philosopher Jean-Luc Marion comes to our rescue.<sup>10</sup> And, as it happens, Marion agrees with me about the unexplainability of love. He demonstrates that this unexplainability is not just the phenomenon of love but also the inadequacy of our cultural and philosophical frameworks for comprehending love. Specifically, he believes that we are using the wrong ideas to understand our relationships with other people.</p>
<h2><b>Descartes on Self</b></h2>
<p><b> </b>These wrong ideas, Marion argues, were popularized by the great philosopher Rene Descartes. We cannot overestimate the influence of this philosopher on our basic understandings of our relationships with others. Most everyone has probably heard Descartess famous proposition "I think, therefore I am,"<sup>11</sup> in which he equated the thinking-I, the rational self, with our identity. Marion sees this proposition as a symptom of a framework for the self that messes up our understanding of love, that indeed makes it unexplainable.</p>
<p>A pivotal part of this Cartesian framework is that the thinking-I, the self, exists separately from other people. After all, I dont need other people in order to think, so my basic identity has little to do with other people or even the world around me. I am who I am <i>without </i>you and the world. And when I do perceive the world, it is a mere perception or representation of that world; it is not the world itself. When I lovingly perceive Karen, I am not experiencing the real person; I am experiencing my representation of her. And there is all sorts of evidence that our mental representations dont always correspond to the person whom our image is supposed to represent. The sweet and loving person I am describing to you right now may not be the authentic Karen at all but merely my mental image of her, which I control to some degree.<sup>12</sup> These representations are called many things in psychology - mental sets, scripts, stereotypes, or schemas - but they all function in the spirit of this Cartesian sense of the self.</p>
<p>An important implication of this Cartesian view of the self, according to Marion, is that we are all in a world of our own representations. It makes sense from this perspective that we would all be egoistic, because everything in our world is basically <i>us - </i>the things we control and the things we want. My representation of Karen is itself egoistic because it has more to do with me than with Karen.<sup>13</sup> It is how I <i>want </i>to think of her rather than how she <i>really </i>is. Descartess rationality, in this sense, functions solely for my benefit.<sup>14</sup> We are, in effect, naturally selfish, because any self in Descartess scheme would maximize the benefits of its representations, which, as I mentioned, is the assumption of many economists.</p>
<p>This selfishness means, of course, that I am not really capable of acting in Karens best interest, especially<i> </i>if her best interest conflicts with my own. I am more likely to use<i> </i>Karen and treat her as a means to my own ends, which is consonant with much of positive psychology, where others exist primarily to make us happy.<sup>15</sup> Many marriage researchers see this selfish mode as the primary cause of our high divorce rate:<sup>16</sup> we see marriage as a means to our individual happiness, not as an end in itself. The bottom line for Marion here is that Descartess understanding of the self makes truly gracious love impossible - not just unexplainable - because truly loving someone means treating them as<i> </i>an end, not as a means, and our Cartesian selfishness always makes the self the end. The best we can do in Descartess framework is to use each other for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>But if all humans are doomed to our own represented<i> </i>world, according to Descartes, how do we function in the real<i> </i>world? Many clinical psychologists might answer this question with one word: <i>poorly.</i> Consider how many of us go through the day experiencing all kinds of misunderstandings with other people. This is because the parts of the real<i> </i>world that dont fit our represented<i> </i>world rarely change our representations. Because <i>I</i> control my representation of Karen, her actual self in the real world cant disrupt my little represented world.<sup>17</sup> Her otherness in the real world wont necessarily alter my stereotype of her. In fact, Descartes predicts that I will make her otherness into the enemy. I will focus on how she is similar to my stereotype of her. This is the reason people want their spouses to be similar to them. Similarities best fit our represented world.</p>
<p>Now, to give Descartes credit, his understanding of self and others makes sense of a lot of my experiences, and this is surely why this understanding is so prevalent in psychology. Still, the question I am raising today is, why doesnt Descartess understanding make sense of my experiences of love? As I have described, I experience none of these implications of his understanding of the self. I am not the selfish dolt that Descartes would predict. I also experience a lot of otherness with Karen, but I experience it not as an enemy of my self and my control. Indeed, I willingly give up my control, allowing for the disruption of my represented world, because of my delight in her otherness. I guess I could be deceiving myself about my unselfishness and my delight, but this deception doesnt account for my other more egoistic relationships, which I apparently see quite clearly. It also doesnt account for those who experience this same type of love - perhaps many of you. What is it, then, about this gracious love that leads us to be so different in these loving interactions?</p>
<h2><b>Marion on Love</b></h2>
<p><b> </b>Although Marion agrees with Descartes on many things, he presents a markedly different understanding of the self. Perhaps first is Marions contention that not everything we experience is representable,<sup>18</sup> with love being one of those things.<sup>19</sup> Gracious love is what he considers a "saturated" experience.<sup>20</sup> Saturation occurs when an experience touches us so deeply that we cant explain or even fathom it. Have you ever witnessed such a stunning sunset that you cant find the words to describe it? Gracious love is similar. It is saturated so much that our experience of it is more than we can grasp or contain in a representation.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Here Marion hits the nail on the head for me. My experience of Karens love is so luminous and so glorious that it feels unearthly. This is the reason we become tongue-tied when trying to explain or justify our love for another. It is the reason we recite poetry or croon love songs.</p>
<p>But why <i>is </i>love so difficult to grasp? Gracious love is gracious for Marion because it is never deserved or rational in the conventional sense;<sup>22</sup> it is a pure gift without strings attached, logical justifications, or ulterior motives. Again, this feels right to me in my relationship with Karen. I naturally sense that I dont deserve her love.<sup>23</sup> Unlike the Cartesian approach, in which everyone <i>must </i>deserve the love they receive from the benefits they provide, love from Marions perspective cannot be controlled through reciprocal benefit and is <i>never</i> truly deserved or justified. Love literally defies conventional logic. Indeed, it is so illogical that Marion believes we are incapable of giving such a pure gift without getting one ourselves - Gods gift of Jesus Christ.<sup>24</sup> Only a truly grateful heart, a heart that has already experienced the Purest of Gifts, can truly love someone in this manner.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>As the philosopher Paul Woodruff describes so well, the only proper response to that which is above or beyond us is reverence.<sup>26</sup> When I come face-to-face with a saturated experience - the wonder of a babys birth, the illumination of a spiritual insight - the only realistic response is a profound honoring of and appreciation for it. This is the reason for my use of the term "blessed" when describing my marriage; our love feels sacred to me, like one of my main duties in life is to reverently protect and nurture it. Miroslav Volf puts it this way: "We enjoy things the most when we experience them as sacraments - as carriers of the presence of another."<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>Gracious love, then, is so "other" - so above and beyond - that it doesnt fit our stereotype or representation of the world.<sup>28</sup> It throws us; it knocks us off our egoistic thrones as controllers of our own little universe.<sup>29</sup> This is the reason we feel so vulnerable when we love. Our egoistic world is put in jeopardy. There is someone <i>else </i>in our world, some "other" who matters to me besides me. Karens differences from me, then, are not <i>outside </i>of my love, as if they are foreign or threatening. They are <i>within </i>and an essential part of my love, even when they exceed my understanding. This excess could, in fact, be the secret of our loves duration across the span of our marriage. Our love is never familiar or predictable, so it can never be staid or boring. Indeed, it fills me with a kind of everyday reverence that I strive to honor and appreciate.</p>
<p>We are also no longer separate selves in the Cartesian sense. My relationship with Karen, because of this saturated experience of love, is part of my very identity. This relationship helps to constitute who I am. I have a kind of shared being with her - perhaps even "one flesh," as the scriptures teach us.<sup>30</sup> You all know about the old couple who finish each others sentences. Marion puts it this way: "I am [only] insofar as I love and [am loved]."<sup>31</sup> How, then, can I be selfish or use her to my own ends when she is part of me?<sup>32</sup> And Marion doesnt believe that she merely enters my world; my love for her serves as a bridge to the real world, where I dont always get what I want. Im not the king or the ultimate controller in the real world. In this sense, Marion doesnt just believe that love is required for good relationships; he believes that gracious love is required to be <i>in touch with reality</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, it is only when we are in touch with this loving reality that we can truly develop as selves. We were reminded of the need for gracious love in 1989 when severely neglected orphans were discovered in Romania.<sup>33</sup> Infants simply cannot thrive without gracious love.<sup>34</sup> I say <i>gracious</i> love specifically because infants never do anything to deserve the love of their caretakers; infants just <i>are,</i> in all their otherness from us. There is no reciprocity with infants, no business transaction; we love them because of who they are. With infants, an experience with a gracious caregiver is a saturated experience, one that breaks through their mental representations and invites them into the real world. Marions understanding of love, for this reason, explains why gracious love is central not only to our mental health but also to our initial and continuing growth as people.</p>
<p>American poet Christian Wiman seems to capture some of the spirit of Marions account and my own experience of Karen when he writes about falling in love with his own wife:</p>
<p><i>Not only was that gray veil between me and the world ripped aside, colors aching back into things, but all the particulars of the world suddenly seemed in excess of themselves, and thus more truly themselves. We, too, were part of this enlargement: it was as if our love demanded some expression beyond the blissful intensity our two lives made. I thought for years that any love had to be limiting, that it was a zero-sum game: what you gave with one part of yourself had to be taken from another. In fact, the great paradox of love, and not just romantic love, is that a closer focus may go hand in hand with a broadened scope.</i><sup>35</sup></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><b> </b>So what, in conclusion, are the practical implications of Marions understanding of love for our everyday lives? What lessons can we draw? I ask you to consider ten such lessons.</p>
<p>1. Love is to some degree ungraspable, so dont get upset when your spouses description of his or her love is inadequate.</p>
<p>2. Love isnt deserved; its a gift. We dont deserve true gifts; otherwise its not a gift at all - its a business transaction. We dont ask true givers to justify their gifts. We accept them humbly, enjoy them, respond with gratefulness, and then give gifts to others who dont deserve them, like us.</p>
<p>3. Avoid "calculator relationships," in which we keep track of units of love given to one another. If were keeping track of them, they arent units of love at all.</p>
<p>4. You dont love someone so they can be happy. Love isnt the means to something else; its the end. The quality of your relationship is the main thing, not the emotional satisfaction of the individuals in the relationships.</p>
<p>5. Love is widely recognized as crucial to mental health, but psychologists typically interpret it as an instrument of individual happiness rather than a crucial pathway out of our egoistic world.</p>
<p>6. Unlike egoistic theories of the social sciences, we are completely capable of unselfishness, whether it is love of a country or love of a person. And, perhaps surprisingly, true unselfishness isnt necessarily experienced as sacrificial, because the other who is loved is literally part of us.</p>
<p>7. Otherness is not the enemy or disrupter of relationships. Loving someone who is different can make us vulnerable, but this vulnerability is part of us giving up control and getting in touch with the real world.</p>
<p>8. When otherness is not the enemy, marital conflicts are less threatening and more productive.</p>
<p>9. The otherness of gracious love is pivotal to our initial and continuing development as persons.</p>
<p>10. Otherness ultimately becomes the spice of our relationships; loving similarities solely is akin to loving a mirror image of ourselves, which is just another kind of selfishness.</p>
<p>These, I believe, are some of the lessons of Marion. I hope they bless your lives as they have mine.</p>

<p>11. Rene Descartes, <i>A Discourse on Method </i>(1637), part IV.</p>
<p>12. With Descartes, love is reduced to a representation of an object for which one feels passion (see Marion, <i>Cartesian Questions</i>, 13132).</p>
<p>13. The cognitive ego makes an alter ego impossible (see Marion, <i>Cartesian Questions,</i> 13132).</p>
<p>14. The ego for Descartes loves only the self. Even charity is interpreted as self-affection (see Marion, <i>Cartesian Questions,</i> 112).</p>

<p>17. "The Cartesian <i>intuitus</i> . . . controls its objects and imposes an order on them" (Christina M. Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion: Exceeding Metaphysics</i> [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007], 227). In Marions view, by contrast, "I am not in control" (Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 221).</p>
<p>18. By "experience" here I do not mean my own "consciousness," because this is still what I am calling here a representation and thus a reduction to an "object," which for Marion eliminates any possibility of love. "Love as a figure of consciousness always ends up in self-idolatry" (Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 231). By experience of a truly other (Karen), I mean that I must allow her own intentionality, her own agency, and her own "counter-current of consciousness" (Marion, <i>Prolegomena to Charity,</i> 82).</p>
<p>19. Marions <i>Prolegomena to Charity </i>(specifically chapter 4) was written in homage to Emmanuel Levinas (see also Levinas, <i>Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority,</i> trans. Alphonso Lingis [Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969]).</p>
<p>20. "I discover myself lovable through the others grace" (Marion, <i>Phenomenon,</i> 213).</p>
<p>21. "The instability of [loving] phenomena thus never comes from a poverty of intuition, but instead from the opposite: from my incapacity to assign to it a precise signification that is individualized and stable" (Marion, <i>Phenomenon,</i> 96). "The beloved therefore emerges not as [a Cartesian] object, but as a . . . saturated phenomenon" (Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 234).</p>
<p>22. "Love lacks neither reason nor logic; quite simply, it does not admit reason or logic other than its own" (Marion, <i>Phenomenon,</i> 217).</p>
<p>23. See Kyle Hubbard, "The Unity of Eros and Agape: On Jean-Luc Marions <i>Erotic Phenomenon,</i>" <i>Essays in Philosophy </i>12, no. 1 (January 2011), 13046.</p>
<p>24. "All human love originates in this divine source" (Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion</i>, 241).</p>
<p>25. Marion argues, for example, that "charity discovers and introduces new phenomena into the world itself and the conceptual universe, which are saturated with meaning and glory, which ordain and eventually save the world" ("Christian Philosophy," 261). Only in his more recent work on the erotic phenomenon (see <i>Phenomenon</i>) does he attempt to rid himself of theological contamination, which Gschwandtner ultimately disputes (see <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 233).</p>
<p>26. See Paul Woodruff, <i>Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue </i>(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001).</p>
<p>27. Miroslav Volf, <i>Flourishing: Why We Need Religion in a Globalized World</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2015), 204.</p>
<p>28. As Gschwandtner notes, "The Cartesian ego here loses control not just over other objects but even over itself" (<i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 237).</p>
<p>29. To become a self in this manner is to become a me that is "uncovered, stripped bare, decentered" (Marion, <i>Prolegomena,</i> 84).</p>
<p>30. For example, Genesis 2:24.</p>
<p>31. Marion, <i>Phenomenon,</i> 195.</p>
<p>32. Similar to Levinas (see <i>Totality and Infinity</i>), love goes beyond the universality and abstractness of deontological ethics, and it issues an ethical call for the particular other. Only love, in fact, can concretize and individualize the face of the other.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to begin my remarks today by paying tribute to my parents. It wasnt until I began serving my mission that I realized some parents dont value their children, dont do everything within their power to make their lives better, and dont help their children aspire to be the best they can be. I was one of the fortunate ones, along with my brother and sister, to be born into a family where I was loved, nurtured, and taught by loving parents. They had high expectations for me, but when I failed, they were still there to guide, encourage, and show me how to pick myself up and move forward.
My parents, to the best of my knowledge, had never been very active in the Church. They encouraged us children to attend, but their attendance was infrequent. Yet it was from them that I learned how to live a Christian life. My father, in particular, was the kind of person who could never pass by someone who needed help.
I recall a trip that we made from Salt Lake City to Bear Lake, where a weekend of clear blue water, swimming, water skiing, and fun awaited me. Our typical route was to go to Evanston, Wyoming, and then on to Bear Lake. About twenty miles to the southwest of Evanston, my father noticed a man was trying to flag down cars on the other side of the divided highway. My father could never pass by someone who needed help. He drove five miles up our side of the freeway until he found the first turnaround, drove back five miles, picked up the man who had run out of gas, went five miles in the wrong direction, turned around again, drove the twenty-five miles back to Evanston, helped the man get gas, and drove him back to his car.
 Being an impatient teenager, I was more than irritated at the long delay. After we finally got on our way, I asked my dad why would he go so far out of his way to help someone. Surely someone else would have stopped and given that man assistance.
My dad simply responded, "What goes around comes around." After seeing the confused look on my face, he further explained, "I believe that someday maybe you or I will be on the side of the road looking for help, and someone will return the favor."
Being ever the optimist, I replied, "I seriously doubt it."
So today I would like to title my talk "Living a Life of Service and Love: What Goes Around Comes Around."
Weve heard this saying before in many different forms. The Boy Scout slogan: Do a good turn daily. Pay it back. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, which is the golden rule. You reap what you sow.
These are all well and good, but my dad lived by the mantra "What goes around comes around." He would help anyone anytime and anywhere.
But on the other hand, how many times have we heard or said that no good deed goes unpunishe</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">How many of you recall seeing the great arch of the Milky Way span the sky over your head, along with millions of other stars that cover the dome of the heavens?
Because I live in a city, one of the things that I forget is the glory of that night sky stretching from one horizon to the other. Prior to the industrialization of society, a view of the night sky filled with stars would have been common. It is breathtaking to realize that the stars seen from Earth are only a few of the stars in our Milky Way Galaxy, which is estimated to contain on the order of 300 billion stars.
Sometime back our friends who have a cabin in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado invited us to a star party in which a group gathered with telescopes far from city lights to view interesting features such as planets in our own solar system and nebulae in our galaxy, as well as the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbor. The telescopes ranged in size from small refracting telescopes on tripods to large reflecting telescopes that required a ladder to get to the eyepiece. As powerful as these amateur telescopes were, astronomy research requires much more powerful instruments.
One of those powerful instruments is the Hubble Space Telescope, built in 1990. It orbits about 350 miles above the earth, far above the interference of the atmosphere. Hubbles mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter, and the entire telescope weighs more than ten tons. Since its launch it has made more than one million observations, resulting in more than 100 terabytes of data. Astronomers from all over the world use the Hubble in their research. Many of you have likely seen images from the Hubble.
Even amateur telescopes can capture a detailed view of Saturn, but the Hubble Telescope is able to catch colorful views of Saturn in wavelengths not visible to the human eye. Saturn is, in my view, the most beautiful planet in our solar system, and it lies only about 1.1 light-hours from Earth at its nearest approach.
Although viewing the planets of our own solar system has yielded spectacular results, the Hubble isnt limited to close-range objects.
Looking beyond our solar system, the Hubble Telescope has captured images of the Ring Nebula, located about 2,000 light-years from Earth, that shows the varying colors of each ring of debris from the supernova that created the nebula thousands of years ago. C. Robert ODell noted that
the nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, its like a jelly doughnut, because its filled with material in the middle. . . . With Hubbles detail, we see a completely different shape than whats been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">After receiving the call from President Worthen asking me to speak at devotional today, I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about what I might say.
One evening my daughter Andrea, who is a recent graduate of BYU, said, "Dad, dont worry. I always went to devotional to feel the Spirit and to have a rest from the stress of a week of school. As long as you bring the Spirit, it will be okay."
My prayer since then has been for the Spirit to attend us here today and to teach us all something new.
I would like to start with a favorite scripture. In 1 Nephi the young Nephi desired to see the same things that his father, Lehi, saw in a vision. An angel came and showed him what Lehi saw - and even more - and asked him, "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" (1 Nephi 11:16).
Nephi replied, "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17).
I remember reading the Book of Mormon as a boy and coming to these verses and thinking, "I dont even know what that word - condescension - means! But wow, I love Nephis answer! He knew that his Heavenly Father loved him, and that was what mattered most to him."
I have spent years pondering this declaration of Nephis. It tells me who I am: I am a child of a loving Father in Heaven. Many in the world today deny the divinity of man. They claim that we are merely the victors in a biological race for superiority of the species on this planet. But I testify that, through holy prophets, God has revealed that as we are His children, there is a purpose to our lives. We should all rejoice in this knowledge that we have. But we should realize that not all people have it.
After arriving in the mission field many years ago, one of the first things I learned was that most of the people in Taiwan with whom I came into contact had no concept of God as their Father in Heaven. I realized that I, however, had always just taken that knowledge for granted. Back then the discussions were memorized and were designated by letters of the alphabet. My favorite discussion quickly became the D discussion, the plan of salvation. I loved it mainly because it allowed us to teach this most fundamental truth - that of our relationship to a loving Heavenly Father. I saw this truth change the lives of the Taiwan Saints. Once they learned it, they were changed people; they radiated a love for their Heavenly Father.
In contrast, a few years ago we had a graduate student in our department who exhibited the opposite. Having been raised in a communist and atheistic country, he had no knowledge of what we are talking about here today. At one point in his studies he had a series of setbacks. From these he concluded that "fate" had turned against him. He felt powerless and not in control of his own destiny. He concluded he was not meant to complete his degree and decided to leave our graduate progra</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">This is one of the highest honors Ive ever received. When I looked to see who some other forum speakers have been, I quickly felt out of place. In fact, I felt like the speaker I heard a few years ago at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC.
Some 4,000 guests attend this breakfast each February, including the president, the vice president, members of the cabinet, House and Senate members, visiting heads of state, and world leaders. Past speakers include Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Tony Blair.
Well, like me, this particular speaker was not especially well known and felt a bit intimidated by his task. He told of sending an email to his pastor the night before, seeking some moral and spiritual support. His pastor wrote back, "Just remember, if youre representing the Lord, you have nothing to worry about - its the Lord who should be worried!"
Well, Im not worried this morning, but I am aware that Im not smart enough to be addressing a prominent university audience. Being in an academic setting reminds me of a story I heard about a class that had been studying birds for much of the semester.
They had studied everything you could possibly study about birds - their feathers, their eyes, their color, and their mating and migration habits. Well, the day for the final test arrived. The teacher distributed a single sheet of paper with 10 pictures showing just the feet of 10 birds and a blank line under each one. He gave the instructions: "Identify each bird by its feet, and youre free to go."
Just then a guy at the back of the room pounded his fist on his desk and shouted, "This is the stupidest thing Ive ever seen!" He wadded his paper into a ball, threw it toward the trash can, and headed for the door.
Just as he reached the door, the teacher yelled, "Young man, whats your name?"
The student ripped off his shoes and socks, pulled up his pant legs, and said, "Here, Teacher! If youre so smart, why dont you tell me?"
Ive always wanted to visit Brigham Young University. Most of you were still in high school when Jerry Falwell went to heaven five years ago. Jerry founded Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, 40 years ago, and in 1980 I went to Liberty, where I played football for four years as a placekicker.
Since the earliest days of Liberty University, Jerry famously and repeatedly declared, "I want Liberty University to be for the evangelical young person what Notre Dame is for the Catholic and Brigham Young is for the Mormon - a world-class university." Well, God gave him enough years to see that dream largely realized.
Today Liberty has 78,000 students, including 13,000 on campus, making it the seventh-largest school of any kind in the country. As an alumnus and a trustee of Liberty, Ive looked forward to the day I would see BYU for myself. So thank you for honoring me with th</span>
