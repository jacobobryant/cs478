  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Im tempted to tell you a story. My wife would say that I shouldnt, but oftentimes introductions include statements that are inaccurate. A speaker at a Rotary Club was introduced as a man from Oklahoma who had just made $10,000 on a cattle deal. When he responded to the introduction, he said there were some inaccuracies: "It wasnt Oklahoma, it was Texas. It wasnt cattle, it was oil. It wasnt $10,000, it was $40,000. It wasnt me, it was my brother, and he didnt win it, he lost it!"

Im honored to be here this night and to look out at this vast audience. My wife, Ruby, and I enjoyed the few months we spent at BYU and, of course, in this beautiful valley. As we were driving down this evening there was a haze hovering just below the peak of Timpanogos. I dont recall that we had ever seen it quite as beautiful as it appeared this evening. We could see the traditional image of the Indian maiden more clearly than ever before. We commented as we were driving along, "What a beautiful valley, what a great people, what a haven in which to live."

I stand at this pulpit, my dear friends, in deep humility. As the eventide settles over this peaceful valley, I reflect on my responsibilities and my desire to communicate to you some encouragement in your own personal lives. And I bring to you not an argument or a doubt, but a heavensent conviction I have that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these latter days, that God lives, that hes real, that he has flesh and bones just as you have and as I have. Jesus &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;the Christ, the Son of the living God. The story told by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he came out of that little grove of trees we affectionately refer to as the "Sacred Grove" is true; he did see God the Father, and the Son, as he reported, and the Church is led by a prophet of God today.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Great Moments of Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Some events happen in our lives that are so overwhelming, yet are linked so clearly to divine power and influence, that however we feel at the time they happen in our lives - and they do or will happen to you, as they have happened to me - we feel so inadequate and unprepared. We see the hand of the Lord in so many ways in this Church, not the least being the calling and spiritual development of ordinary people like you and me. Someone has likened each of our lives to a mighty river as it flows into the sea. It is the product of many streams - some large, some small - and even brooks, created by the melting snow high in the mountains. I thank God for the streams, clear and pure, that have influenced my life: for the goodly parents who taught me the goodness of life - honor and virtue - and who taught me to love the Lord; for the small towns where we made our own fun and adventure; for my widowed mother, who always taught correct principles; for the priesthood and the scouting program; for the chance to go away to college and for the blessing of finding a girl I knew should be my companion. I saw her first at a dance at the Old Mill in a canyon east of Salt Lake. I remember the dress she was wearing. I remember how much fun she was having with her date. I was sitting there with someone else. As I watched this girl dancing by, I asked my date, "Do you know her?"

She said, "Yes."

I recall saying, "Why dont you introduce me to her?" Now that isnt the way you win friends and influence people!

I remember how hard I worked to get a date with her. I would phone her. She would have a date, and I would say, "What time is he coming?"

"Eight oclock."

"How about seeing me at six?" I was determined, because I had a deep impression that this was the girl I should marry. I wanted to marry the right person in the right place. I remind all of you who are here that the most important decision you will make in your life is who you marry and where you marry that person. Never forget it. Never deemphasize it.

I have moved my wife and our family all over America. She still is beautiful and understanding - sustaining me, provoking me when needed, but always by my side. We are blessed with a lovely daughter and two fine sons, choice and wonderful daughters-in-law and a son-in-law, and with eighteen grandchildren. Theyre all perfect, we think.

When I was younger than most of you, growing up in a little town in Idaho, I thought the great moment of my life would be that I would be a successful baseball player for the New York Yankees. We would be in the World Series; the games would be three and three. Now, the seventh game - the deciding game - the ninth inning, score tied. And guess who would get up to bat? The pitcher would put the ball in just where I would like it, and I would knock it out of Yankee Stadium. The ball would become lost in the parking lot. I would be the hero of the World Series. I thought that would be the great moment of my life. But I want you to know that that isnt so. Not that the World Series happened; however, I found the moment.

A few years ago I sat in a little white room in the Los Angeles Temple - a little, plain, simple room with no fancy adornments on the wall. My wife was there by my side. One son and his wife were there along with our daughter and her new husband. Our other son was kneeling at the altar holding the hand of the young lady he was about to marry. As I looked around the room, I thought, "David, you had your priorities out of order. Some athletic event or being the hero of some worldly event isnt the great moment of your life." I knew the great moment of my life was there, then, because all I had that was really important - remember, really important - was in that room. Some bishops and stake presidents somewhere had found all of my family worthy to be in that room. It is not the number of cars you own, or the number of white-faced cattle you might have in the hills, or the size of your bank account, but the eternal values that count. You remember the Lord said something about moth and rust getting through to our worldly possessions (see Matthew 6:20). I knew that the greatest moment in my life was having all of our family in that room in the Los Angeles Temple. Moments, reflection, blessings - these are the great moments of our lives.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Witness of the Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A few days ago I had the opportunity of being in a radio broadcasting studio in Melbourne, Australia. We were there with President Kimball, as you know, holding area conferences. I was to be interviewed for thirty minutes. As it turned out, Mr. Norman Banks, the radio personality, kept me for an hour. As we conversed and answered phone calls on the air about the Church, I felt again the great blessings and truths of this gospel. I would say to you, "Never doubt that this is the Lords work. There are times or situations you are in when you know that the Lord blesses you." I didnt know we were going to have a "live" broadcast. I thought I would be interviewed "on tape" and have an opportunity to make corrections if necessary. Then I was informed we were going on the air live, that it was a talk show.

I know that, if we desire, the Lord will magnify us and bless us. I was impressed as this radio program got underway with the clarity of my mind and the calmness that came over me. We all felt the hand of the Lord. I had an opportunity to reply to questions that came in over the telephone: "What is a prophet?" "How is he appointed?" "Are you really an apostle?" "How were you selected?" "What special training or schooling have you had to be called a prophet?" "Why are all of you in Australia?" "Are you concerned what ministers say about your doctrine? You must know that they use some very strong language about you." "Are you carrying on a dialogue with any other church, hoping to merge with them?" "What do you hope to accomplish in Australia?"

The lights kept flashing on the switchboard as the calls came in. Ninety percent of them were the most positive, wonderful expressions you could imagine. "Ive just been baptized. My whole life has changed. Thank you, thank you for bringing the Church to Australia," a voice said. Another voice: "Were now holding family home evening. Our family is now back together. Thank you for the Church and the prophet coming to Australia." The radio commentator caught the enthusiasm and the spirit of most of these callers, and when a caller wanted to take issue with me, the commentator said, "Youve made your point, and you need to develop some love in your heart!" He was on my side! As these episodes were unfolding, I would wonder at times, "Am I saying, am I doing, what I should be? Im now a special witness of the Lord."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Call to Serve&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I want you to know that I have grown up in the Church just as you have. Ive gone through the steps and the challenges that you have and that you are going through. I understand your concerns, but I also have a concept of your opportunities.

Fifty-nine days ago today President Kimball phoned me at my office and requested me to meet him in the Salt Lake Temple. It was about two oclock. I walked to the Temple wondering what I had done wrong. Did he plan to change my assignments or my responsibilities? Perhaps I wasnt measuring up to my calling. As we met on the fourth floor in the Temple, he had his usual warm greeting, which was reassuring to me. President Tanner and President Romney and the eleven were meeting in another room. President Kimball invited me into an empty room there on the fourth floor where we were alone - alone in this beautiful room in the House of the Lord with the Lords prophet. After some inquiry about my life President Kimball took me by both of my hands and, looking deeply but kindly into my eyes (and, it seemed, right into my soul), he said he was calling me to fill the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve. I was overcome. I could hardly say a word. Words are inadequate to describe my feelings even as I stand here with you. There comes a swelling within that is indescribable. You think, "Me? Why is he calling me? How can I? There are so many that are more worthy. Such great men have been so honored."

With the two of us all alone, communicating with our hearts and our souls, the Lords prophet calling me, I knew I was in the presence of the Lords anointed. Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote that there are times "too full for sound and foam" ("Crossing the Bar," 1889). I understand what he was writing about. The prophet invited me to meet the other Brethren. As we walked across the hall and into the room where they were waiting, they were all so warm and friendly. It helped my feet get back on the floor. President Kimball said, "Do you want to call Ruby?" As I stood there in sort of a daze looking at the telephone, President Kimball jokingly said, "Do you remember your phone number?" I was having such a difficult time dialing, Elder Boyd Packer inquired, "Do you remember Rubys name?" And then my Brethren, with their great warmth and understanding, assured me that they had all had the same experience. As Ruby answered the phone, she detected some strangeness in my voice. Im sure it was a little unsteady, weak, and shaky. She said, "Where are you?"

I said, "Im in the Temple."

She said, "What are you doing in the Temple?" Then I told her what had happened, and she began to cry.

All of you young men, and the rest of you, what would we do without loving, understanding companions? Be grateful for the Lords plan. We understand that Mother Eve is a joint heir with Father Adam to the blessings of exaltation. That blessing is for all of you who are so married in the House of the Lord and are valiant to the end.

President Kimball, joined by all the Brethren of the First Presidency and the Quorum, placed his hands on my head. He ordained me to this calling with words I will always remember: "an apostle is entitled to the revelations of the Lord in very deed"; "we promise our lives, all of our efforts, our thoughts"; "keys, powers of the apostleship." I was reminded, "You are the eighty-second so chosen in this dispensation." I have been called to join the finest group of men on earth. There is no group of men like them anywhere.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lords Prophet, President Kimball&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I had a feeling, as I wondered what to say to you here this night, that you might appreciate this personal treasure of mine. I thought I would share it with you as I testify of my knowledge that &lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/spencer-w-kimball/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;President Kimball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our prophet, is the mouthpiece of God on earth. The Lord says that he is to be like unto Moses - a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the Church (see D&amp;amp;C 107:9192).

Your hearts would have been caused to burn as did ours as we watched him preside over nine separate area conferences during the last few days, each with three general sessions and separate priesthood and mothers-and-daughters meetings. I feel blessed to have seen and felt the love the Saints have for him and his love for the people all over the world - in Samoa, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, and Tahiti; in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The Saints expressed their love in their welcome for him, and then again throughout the meetings in their songs and testimonies. They had spent weeks and weeks in preparation. Streets, fences, and buildings were decorated with ferns, orchids, hibiscus, and coconut fronds. They had fasted and prayed that the rains would cease. The rain fell before and during the meeting. One day the rain fell exactly at ten oclock. We were all inside and the meeting had started. We dont think a drop ever fell on the prophet. They had fasted and prayed.

Several hundred students lined the road to our school in Tonga, standing at attention, immaculately uniformed. Boy scouts formed honor guards; several hundred of our teenagers hired buses to take them to the Melbourne airport to greet the prophet. They had paid a dollar each. The plane was going to be twenty minutes late, and they were fearful that the bus couldnt wait and they would have to go back to the city. But the plane arrived in a few moments, and tears flowed as they had a chance to see him and to touch his hand. One of our group saw an excited five-year-old boy and asked, "Did you shake his hand?"

This little boy said, "No, but I saw him. Boy, did I see him!" The little boy handed this member of our party a little envelope and said, "Will you give this to the prophet?" When it was opened, here was a little hand drawn picture of President Kimball. Scrawled at the bottom was "Love, from Luke."

Heads of state, government leaders, and government ministers were all gracious in receiving the prophet and his party. Im sure that missionary activity as well as Church participation will surely increase sharply after this visit by the prophet. You could feel the spiritual impact of his being there and the reaction in the cities, the people, the press, and those who visited or interviewed him.

Probably the highlight of the entire trip was the conference session Sunday morning televised to all of Australia from the beautiful Sydney Opera House. The three Sydney stakes prepared the choir, and their own local speakers were just superb. We were so proud of what they did. You would have thought the Tabernacle Choir was there, they did such a marvelous work. Then, even though the President was tired, he was abundantly blessed as he spoke to this nationwide audience, explaining and testifying of the truthfulness of the gospel. The prophet was testifying and explaining that to be a prophet of the Lord one does not need to be everything to all men. He does not need to be youthful and athletic, an industrialist, a financier, nor an agriculturist. He does not need to be a musician, a poet, an entertainer, nor a banker, a physician, nor a college president, a military general, nor a scientist. He does not need to be a linguist, to speak French, Japanese, German, and Spanish. But he must understand the divine language and be able to receive messages from heaven. He need not be an orator, for God can make his own. The Lord can present his divine message through weak men made strong. What the world needs is a prophet-leader who gives example, clean, full of faith, godlike in his attitude, with an untarnished name - a beloved husband, a true father.

We were so thrilled as he explained this to people who would say, "What is a prophet? Why do you have one? We dont have them, so why do you have them?" He told them that a prophet needs to be more than a priest or a minister or an elder. His voice becomes the voice of God to reveal new programs, new truths, new solutions. He made no claim of infallibility. He must be bold enough to speak truth, even against popular clamor for lessening restrictions. He must be certain of his divine appointment, of his celestial ordination, and of his authority to call to service, to ordain, to pass keys which fit eternal locks.

My dear friends, have no fear of Spencer W. Kimball not being in tune to receive Gods instructions. The witness is mine that he is one of Gods great prophets. I know not what may lie ahead, but of one thing I am certain: I am committed in every way to serve the Master, to testify of him, and to follow the direction of President Kimball as his spokesman.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obedience to Revelation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Lord wants and needs all of you to be strong, to be believers, to be an example of goodness to all the world. Mediocrity and weaklings come cheap. The world is full of them. As you plan your future and as you have doubts about big decisions, read what the prophet says. We sing a song, but I dont think we sing it often enough - "Come, listen to a prophets voice, and hear the word of God." Listen to what the prophet says. Read what he says. Read everything you can get your hands on that he says. He will never lead you astray, and you wont go astray if you follow that direction. Live so you can ask for the revelation that you are entitled to personally.

I was at a stake conference a few weeks ago in Augusta, Maine. I heard from a sixteen-year-old girl who had been called to be a class leader - sixteen years old. She said she made a list of seventeen names for counselors. She prayed for help. The next day she crossed off three of them. After praying and asking the Lord for more help, two days later she said there were only two names left on the list. This young lady had had her own experience and testimony of personal revelation that you are entitled to.

Listen to those who have gone down the road ahead of you. Dont be classed with those of whom we say, "In one ear and out the other." Dont do that. Listen to those that have had some experience and have been down that road. Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote, "Is it possible to transmit the experience of those who have suffered to those who have yet to suffer?" (&lt;i&gt;Readers Digest, &lt;/i&gt;December 1975, p. 69). Is it possible? Can one part of humanity learn from the bitter experience of another?

I leave my blessings with you, praying humbly for you to live the standards of the Church. I know you hear it often, but how are you doing with it? The scholarly Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "Souls are not saved in bundles. The Spirit sayeth to the man, How is it with thee? thee personally?" ("Conduct of life: Worship"). How &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;things with you personally, you - human, child of God, an important person, a member of the Church, family, children, future, vision of eternity? How are you doing? Come, listen to a prophets voice, and hear the words of God.

Sister Haight and I were going through London a few weeks ago. From one of the London papers I cut out a little story in which the headmaster of one of the renowned prep schools in England (where Winston Churchill had gone to school as a boy) was telling a story about Churchill. Before he died they invited him, then in his old age but an experienced, great man with all of the background that he had had, to stand before the student body of this prep school. This was all that he had to say: "Never forsake the things that you know to be true. Never, never, never, never." May that blessing be yours. The gospel is true. This is the hope of the world. This gospel is the salvation of the human race, I testify to you in all humility, thanking you for this opportunity, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Im tempted to tell you a story. My wife would say that I shouldnt, but oftentimes introductions include statements that are inaccurate. A speaker at a Rotary Club was introduced as a man from Oklahoma who had just made $10,000 on a cattle deal. When he responded to the introduction, he said there were some inaccuracies: "It wasnt Oklahoma, it was Texas. It wasnt cattle, it was oil. It wasnt $10,000, it was $40,000. It wasnt me, it was my brother, and he didnt win it, he lost it!"</p>
<p>Im honored to be here this night and to look out at this vast audience. My wife, Ruby, and I enjoyed the few months we spent at BYU and, of course, in this beautiful valley. As we were driving down this evening there was a haze hovering just below the peak of Timpanogos. I dont recall that we had ever seen it quite as beautiful as it appeared this evening. We could see the traditional image of the Indian maiden more clearly than ever before. We commented as we were driving along, "What a beautiful valley, what a great people, what a haven in which to live."</p>
<p>I stand at this pulpit, my dear friends, in deep humility. As the eventide settles over this peaceful valley, I reflect on my responsibilities and my desire to communicate to you some encouragement in your own personal lives. And I bring to you not an argument or a doubt, but a heavensent conviction I have that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these latter days, that God lives, that hes real, that he has flesh and bones just as you have and as I have. Jesus <i>is </i>the Christ, the Son of the living God. The story told by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he came out of that little grove of trees we affectionately refer to as the "Sacred Grove" is true; he did see God the Father, and the Son, as he reported, and the Church is led by a prophet of God today.</p>
<h2><b>Great Moments of Life</b></h2>
<p>Some events happen in our lives that are so overwhelming, yet are linked so clearly to divine power and influence, that however we feel at the time they happen in our lives - and they do or will happen to you, as they have happened to me - we feel so inadequate and unprepared. We see the hand of the Lord in so many ways in this Church, not the least being the calling and spiritual development of ordinary people like you and me. Someone has likened each of our lives to a mighty river as it flows into the sea. It is the product of many streams - some large, some small - and even brooks, created by the melting snow high in the mountains. I thank God for the streams, clear and pure, that have influenced my life: for the goodly parents who taught me the goodness of life - honor and virtue - and who taught me to love the Lord; for the small towns where we made our own fun and adventure; for my widowed mother, who always taught correct principles; for the priesthood and the scouting program; for the chance to go away to college and for the blessing of finding a girl I knew should be my companion. I saw her first at a dance at the Old Mill in a canyon east of Salt Lake. I remember the dress she was wearing. I remember how much fun she was having with her date. I was sitting there with someone else. As I watched this girl dancing by, I asked my date, "Do you know her?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes."</p>
<p>I recall saying, "Why dont you introduce me to her?" Now that isnt the way you win friends and influence people!</p>
<p>I remember how hard I worked to get a date with her. I would phone her. She would have a date, and I would say, "What time is he coming?"</p>
<p>"Eight oclock."</p>
<p>"How about seeing me at six?" I was determined, because I had a deep impression that this was the girl I should marry. I wanted to marry the right person in the right place. I remind all of you who are here that the most important decision you will make in your life is who you marry and where you marry that person. Never forget it. Never deemphasize it.</p>
<p>I have moved my wife and our family all over America. She still is beautiful and understanding - sustaining me, provoking me when needed, but always by my side. We are blessed with a lovely daughter and two fine sons, choice and wonderful daughters-in-law and a son-in-law, and with eighteen grandchildren. Theyre all perfect, we think.</p>
<p>When I was younger than most of you, growing up in a little town in Idaho, I thought the great moment of my life would be that I would be a successful baseball player for the New York Yankees. We would be in the World Series; the games would be three and three. Now, the seventh game - the deciding game - the ninth inning, score tied. And guess who would get up to bat? The pitcher would put the ball in just where I would like it, and I would knock it out of Yankee Stadium. The ball would become lost in the parking lot. I would be the hero of the World Series. I thought that would be the great moment of my life. But I want you to know that that isnt so. Not that the World Series happened; however, I found the moment.</p>
<p>A few years ago I sat in a little white room in the Los Angeles Temple - a little, plain, simple room with no fancy adornments on the wall. My wife was there by my side. One son and his wife were there along with our daughter and her new husband. Our other son was kneeling at the altar holding the hand of the young lady he was about to marry. As I looked around the room, I thought, "David, you had your priorities out of order. Some athletic event or being the hero of some worldly event isnt the great moment of your life." I knew the great moment of my life was there, then, because all I had that was really important - remember, really important - was in that room. Some bishops and stake presidents somewhere had found all of my family worthy to be in that room. It is not the number of cars you own, or the number of white-faced cattle you might have in the hills, or the size of your bank account, but the eternal values that count. You remember the Lord said something about moth and rust getting through to our worldly possessions (see Matthew 6:20). I knew that the greatest moment in my life was having all of our family in that room in the Los Angeles Temple. Moments, reflection, blessings - these are the great moments of our lives.</p>
<h2><b>A Witness of the Truth</b></h2>
<p>A few days ago I had the opportunity of being in a radio broadcasting studio in Melbourne, Australia. We were there with President Kimball, as you know, holding area conferences. I was to be interviewed for thirty minutes. As it turned out, Mr. Norman Banks, the radio personality, kept me for an hour. As we conversed and answered phone calls on the air about the Church, I felt again the great blessings and truths of this gospel. I would say to you, "Never doubt that this is the Lords work. There are times or situations you are in when you know that the Lord blesses you." I didnt know we were going to have a "live" broadcast. I thought I would be interviewed "on tape" and have an opportunity to make corrections if necessary. Then I was informed we were going on the air live, that it was a talk show.</p>
<p>I know that, if we desire, the Lord will magnify us and bless us. I was impressed as this radio program got underway with the clarity of my mind and the calmness that came over me. We all felt the hand of the Lord. I had an opportunity to reply to questions that came in over the telephone: "What is a prophet?" "How is he appointed?" "Are you really an apostle?" "How were you selected?" "What special training or schooling have you had to be called a prophet?" "Why are all of you in Australia?" "Are you concerned what ministers say about your doctrine? You must know that they use some very strong language about you." "Are you carrying on a dialogue with any other church, hoping to merge with them?" "What do you hope to accomplish in Australia?"</p>
<p>The lights kept flashing on the switchboard as the calls came in. Ninety percent of them were the most positive, wonderful expressions you could imagine. "Ive just been baptized. My whole life has changed. Thank you, thank you for bringing the Church to Australia," a voice said. Another voice: "Were now holding family home evening. Our family is now back together. Thank you for the Church and the prophet coming to Australia." The radio commentator caught the enthusiasm and the spirit of most of these callers, and when a caller wanted to take issue with me, the commentator said, "Youve made your point, and you need to develop some love in your heart!" He was on my side! As these episodes were unfolding, I would wonder at times, "Am I saying, am I doing, what I should be? Im now a special witness of the Lord."</p>
<h2><b>A Call to Serve</b></h2>
<p>I want you to know that I have grown up in the Church just as you have. Ive gone through the steps and the challenges that you have and that you are going through. I understand your concerns, but I also have a concept of your opportunities.</p>
<p>Fifty-nine days ago today President Kimball phoned me at my office and requested me to meet him in the Salt Lake Temple. It was about two oclock. I walked to the Temple wondering what I had done wrong. Did he plan to change my assignments or my responsibilities? Perhaps I wasnt measuring up to my calling. As we met on the fourth floor in the Temple, he had his usual warm greeting, which was reassuring to me. President Tanner and President Romney and the eleven were meeting in another room. President Kimball invited me into an empty room there on the fourth floor where we were alone - alone in this beautiful room in the House of the Lord with the Lords prophet. After some inquiry about my life President Kimball took me by both of my hands and, looking deeply but kindly into my eyes (and, it seemed, right into my soul), he said he was calling me to fill the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve. I was overcome. I could hardly say a word. Words are inadequate to describe my feelings even as I stand here with you. There comes a swelling within that is indescribable. You think, "Me? Why is he calling me? How can I? There are so many that are more worthy. Such great men have been so honored."</p>
<p>With the two of us all alone, communicating with our hearts and our souls, the Lords prophet calling me, I knew I was in the presence of the Lords anointed. Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote that there are times "too full for sound and foam" ("Crossing the Bar," 1889). I understand what he was writing about. The prophet invited me to meet the other Brethren. As we walked across the hall and into the room where they were waiting, they were all so warm and friendly. It helped my feet get back on the floor. President Kimball said, "Do you want to call Ruby?" As I stood there in sort of a daze looking at the telephone, President Kimball jokingly said, "Do you remember your phone number?" I was having such a difficult time dialing, Elder Boyd Packer inquired, "Do you remember Rubys name?" And then my Brethren, with their great warmth and understanding, assured me that they had all had the same experience. As Ruby answered the phone, she detected some strangeness in my voice. Im sure it was a little unsteady, weak, and shaky. She said, "Where are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Im in the Temple."</p>
<p>She said, "What are you doing in the Temple?" Then I told her what had happened, and she began to cry.</p>
<p>All of you young men, and the rest of you, what would we do without loving, understanding companions? Be grateful for the Lords plan. We understand that Mother Eve is a joint heir with Father Adam to the blessings of exaltation. That blessing is for all of you who are so married in the House of the Lord and are valiant to the end.</p>
<p>President Kimball, joined by all the Brethren of the First Presidency and the Quorum, placed his hands on my head. He ordained me to this calling with words I will always remember: "an apostle is entitled to the revelations of the Lord in very deed"; "we promise our lives, all of our efforts, our thoughts"; "keys, powers of the apostleship." I was reminded, "You are the eighty-second so chosen in this dispensation." I have been called to join the finest group of men on earth. There is no group of men like them anywhere.</p>
<h2><b>The Lords Prophet, President Kimball</b></h2>
<p>I had a feeling, as I wondered what to say to you here this night, that you might appreciate this personal treasure of mine. I thought I would share it with you as I testify of my knowledge that <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/spencer-w-kimball/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">President Kimball</span></a>, our prophet, is the mouthpiece of God on earth. The Lord says that he is to be like unto Moses - a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the Church (see D&amp;C 107:9192).</p>
<p>Your hearts would have been caused to burn as did ours as we watched him preside over nine separate area conferences during the last few days, each with three general sessions and separate priesthood and mothers-and-daughters meetings. I feel blessed to have seen and felt the love the Saints have for him and his love for the people all over the world - in Samoa, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, and Tahiti; in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The Saints expressed their love in their welcome for him, and then again throughout the meetings in their songs and testimonies. They had spent weeks and weeks in preparation. Streets, fences, and buildings were decorated with ferns, orchids, hibiscus, and coconut fronds. They had fasted and prayed that the rains would cease. The rain fell before and during the meeting. One day the rain fell exactly at ten oclock. We were all inside and the meeting had started. We dont think a drop ever fell on the prophet. They had fasted and prayed.</p>
<p>Several hundred students lined the road to our school in Tonga, standing at attention, immaculately uniformed. Boy scouts formed honor guards; several hundred of our teenagers hired buses to take them to the Melbourne airport to greet the prophet. They had paid a dollar each. The plane was going to be twenty minutes late, and they were fearful that the bus couldnt wait and they would have to go back to the city. But the plane arrived in a few moments, and tears flowed as they had a chance to see him and to touch his hand. One of our group saw an excited five-year-old boy and asked, "Did you shake his hand?"</p>
<p>This little boy said, "No, but I saw him. Boy, did I see him!" The little boy handed this member of our party a little envelope and said, "Will you give this to the prophet?" When it was opened, here was a little hand drawn picture of President Kimball. Scrawled at the bottom was "Love, from Luke."</p>
<p>Heads of state, government leaders, and government ministers were all gracious in receiving the prophet and his party. Im sure that missionary activity as well as Church participation will surely increase sharply after this visit by the prophet. You could feel the spiritual impact of his being there and the reaction in the cities, the people, the press, and those who visited or interviewed him.</p>
<p>Probably the highlight of the entire trip was the conference session Sunday morning televised to all of Australia from the beautiful Sydney Opera House. The three Sydney stakes prepared the choir, and their own local speakers were just superb. We were so proud of what they did. You would have thought the Tabernacle Choir was there, they did such a marvelous work. Then, even though the President was tired, he was abundantly blessed as he spoke to this nationwide audience, explaining and testifying of the truthfulness of the gospel. The prophet was testifying and explaining that to be a prophet of the Lord one does not need to be everything to all men. He does not need to be youthful and athletic, an industrialist, a financier, nor an agriculturist. He does not need to be a musician, a poet, an entertainer, nor a banker, a physician, nor a college president, a military general, nor a scientist. He does not need to be a linguist, to speak French, Japanese, German, and Spanish. But he must understand the divine language and be able to receive messages from heaven. He need not be an orator, for God can make his own. The Lord can present his divine message through weak men made strong. What the world needs is a prophet-leader who gives example, clean, full of faith, godlike in his attitude, with an untarnished name - a beloved husband, a true father.</p>
<p>We were so thrilled as he explained this to people who would say, "What is a prophet? Why do you have one? We dont have them, so why do you have them?" He told them that a prophet needs to be more than a priest or a minister or an elder. His voice becomes the voice of God to reveal new programs, new truths, new solutions. He made no claim of infallibility. He must be bold enough to speak truth, even against popular clamor for lessening restrictions. He must be certain of his divine appointment, of his celestial ordination, and of his authority to call to service, to ordain, to pass keys which fit eternal locks.</p>
<p>My dear friends, have no fear of Spencer W. Kimball not being in tune to receive Gods instructions. The witness is mine that he is one of Gods great prophets. I know not what may lie ahead, but of one thing I am certain: I am committed in every way to serve the Master, to testify of him, and to follow the direction of President Kimball as his spokesman.</p>
<h2><b>Obedience to Revelation</b></h2>
<p>The Lord wants and needs all of you to be strong, to be believers, to be an example of goodness to all the world. Mediocrity and weaklings come cheap. The world is full of them. As you plan your future and as you have doubts about big decisions, read what the prophet says. We sing a song, but I dont think we sing it often enough - "Come, listen to a prophets voice, and hear the word of God." Listen to what the prophet says. Read what he says. Read everything you can get your hands on that he says. He will never lead you astray, and you wont go astray if you follow that direction. Live so you can ask for the revelation that you are entitled to personally.</p>
<p>I was at a stake conference a few weeks ago in Augusta, Maine. I heard from a sixteen-year-old girl who had been called to be a class leader - sixteen years old. She said she made a list of seventeen names for counselors. She prayed for help. The next day she crossed off three of them. After praying and asking the Lord for more help, two days later she said there were only two names left on the list. This young lady had had her own experience and testimony of personal revelation that you are entitled to.</p>
<p>Listen to those who have gone down the road ahead of you. Dont be classed with those of whom we say, "In one ear and out the other." Dont do that. Listen to those that have had some experience and have been down that road. Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote, "Is it possible to transmit the experience of those who have suffered to those who have yet to suffer?" (<i>Readers Digest, </i>December 1975, p. 69). Is it possible? Can one part of humanity learn from the bitter experience of another?</p>
<p>I leave my blessings with you, praying humbly for you to live the standards of the Church. I know you hear it often, but how are you doing with it? The scholarly Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "Souls are not saved in bundles. The Spirit sayeth to the man, How is it with thee? thee personally?" ("Conduct of life: Worship"). How <i>are </i>things with you personally, you - human, child of God, an important person, a member of the Church, family, children, future, vision of eternity? How are you doing? Come, listen to a prophets voice, and hear the words of God.</p>
<p>Sister Haight and I were going through London a few weeks ago. From one of the London papers I cut out a little story in which the headmaster of one of the renowned prep schools in England (where Winston Churchill had gone to school as a boy) was telling a story about Churchill. Before he died they invited him, then in his old age but an experienced, great man with all of the background that he had had, to stand before the student body of this prep school. This was all that he had to say: "Never forsake the things that you know to be true. Never, never, never, never." May that blessing be yours. The gospel is true. This is the hope of the world. This gospel is the salvation of the human race, I testify to you in all humility, thanking you for this opportunity, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">His reputation for concern for the one - particularly the widow or the wounded, the poor or the persecuted - is widely known. Perhaps you would also like to know, if you dont already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monsons close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because Im sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, Id like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didnt know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have looked forward to the opportunity of accepting the assignment and the invitation to be with you today, for I realize you are the heart and soul of many of the parents of this Church, all over the world. What a glorious sight you are! I am also pleased to recognize the officers and faculty members of this fine institution.
My dear young brothers and sisters, you are in the prime of your lives. You are on the cutting edge of progress. You live in a time of extreme difficulties but also a time of exceptional opportunities. I think the nation and the world have never been beset with a greater variety of challenges to meet and problems to solve, and you and those similar to you are destined to meet those challenges and to solve those problems. I know you can, because the Lord will provide the help you need.
I love the passage from the book of Acts in the New Testament where we read of the confrontation between a man from Ethiopia, who was reading from scripture, and Philip of old. Philip asked the man if he understood the words he was reading. The man replied to Philip, "How can I, except some man should guide me?"1 Of course Philip sat with him and guided him in his understanding.
Just last Thursday I was sitting in the room in the Salt Lake Temple where the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve meet once each week. I gazed up at the wall which faces the First Presidency, and there I observed a portrait of each President of the Church. As my gaze moved from the Prophet Joseph right down through President Hinckley, I thought, "We have had great Presidents of this Church. Each one has guided us; his writings have stimulated us; his messages have inspired us. To show us the way, we have those whom the Lord has provided."
Some years ago I spoke here of the Presidents of the Church I have known, giving brief personal glimpses. Today I would like to mention each one in greater depth.
The man who was President of the Church when I was born and who was president until I was nearly eighteen years old was the seventh President of the Church, Heber J. Grant. He was ordained and set apart as President on November 23, 1918, at the age of 62.
The Church was a little different when President Grant was President. His personal office was what we refer to now as the First Presidency Boardroom. He sat at a large, rather imposing desk in the enormous room, and just about anyone could drop in to see him. The Church was relatively small at the time. A friend of mine told me that he and another young man had been asked to visit President Grant to see if he would come to their ward and speak at the commemoration of the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood they were planning. He said they walked through the front door of the Church Administration Building, walked to the back of the building where President Grants secretary sat, and said, "Is the President in?"
She replied, "Yes, wou</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thirty-three years ago, while a student at Brigham Young University, I had a small role in an evening fireside like the one we are holding tonight. The speaker was President Spencer W. Kimball, and I found myself walking next to him as he moved toward the entry coming into the Marriott Center. I asked him if he ever became nervous standing before such a large assembly. With a smile, he responded: "Brother Andersen, you know that the scriptures say, If ye are prepared ye shall not fear (D&amp;C 38:30). I am trembling from my head to my toes." Tonight I know how he felt.
I express my love and respect for each of you seated here and for you who are gathered across the world. I know of your goodness and devotion to the gospel, your faith and hope for the future, and your desire to please your Heavenly Father. I pray that the Lords Spirit will bless my words and your understanding.
Hold Fast to the Iron Rod
I want to tell you of the Lords guiding hand in our meeting tonight. During the early days of January I worked to organize and outline what I would present to you. Knowing that Elder David A. Bednar was scheduled to speak to you in February, I asked him if he had finalized the subject he would address.
I was taken aback when he responded that his talk was about holding fast to the iron rod. It was the exact title I had chosen for my talk. The choir was already practicing this beautiful number that they have just shared with us.
As Elder Bednar and I discussed the messages we had prepared, it was evident that we had approached the subject differently. Elder Bednar thought for a moment and said: "The Lord loves the young adults of the Church. There is purpose in this. This is a message the Lord wants delivered." I determined to proceed.
Then, just a week later and before Elder Bednars talk, President Boyd K. Packer, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a BYU devotional address he entitled "Lehis Dream and You."1 He too included in his talk what it means to hold fast to the iron rod.
My brothers and sisters, this is a subject the Lord wants you to think about.
You will remember from the talks of President Packer and Elder Bednar, and from your own study of the Book of Mormon, the key elements of Lehis dream of the tree of life. Elder Bednar taught us that the tree of life, identified as the love of God, is a representation of Jesus Christ and that the joy and happiness received by partaking of the fruit of the tree symbolizes the blessings of the Saviors Atonement (see 1 Nephi 8:10; 11:89, 2124).2

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great honor for me to welcome you to a new semester at Brigham Young University. My husband and I want you to know that we love and admire you. Your success and growth spiritually, academically, intellectually, and socially are of great importance to us as well as to others associated with the university. In every area of interest to you we encourage you to strive for integrity and excellence. The experiences and knowledge gained during your time here will influence the rest of your lives.
A few years ago my husband and I were enjoying visiting Australia. It was promising to be another beautiful spring day in the outskirts of Sydney. We were to be involved in a mission presidents seminar for presidents and their wives in that area of the world. However, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, the telephone rang and woke us from our sleep. My experience with middle-of-the-night telephone calls has been that they usually portend bad news. Thus, as my husband got out of bed to answer the phone, I was quite nervous and concerned. As he answered the phone, I heard him say, "Hello, Emma."
I relaxed somewhat, knowing that Emma was his secretary in the Office of the Seventy. I knew that we were 16 hours ahead of Salt Lake City time and it was Tuesday during working hours there. My thought was that she just wanted to talk to him before he became involved in the meetings of the day. However, his response to whatever she was saying to him was a very shocked "Oh, no!"
Again I became very concerned and surmised that it was not good news but involved something or someone from the Church family and not our own immediate one. I recall that he hung up the telephone and came and said to me that Emma had just reported to him that two planes had hit the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. We were instructed to remain in Australia until further notice.
We, of course, got up and turned on the television and were filled with shock, horror, and great sadness as we saw and heard of the devastating attacks in our homeland. The seminar began that day, but, as you can imagine, it wasnt quite business as usual. A great somberness filled all our hearts. I felt such a heaviness of spirit.
The day proceeded with an abbreviated schedule as well as phone calls by the participants in the seminar to their homes and families. We were also informed that we would be able to receive the audio portion of a program to be held that evening originating from the Tabernacle on Temple Square.
The time came to hear the broadcast from Salt Lake City. I cannot recall exactly what was said or sung that night; however, I can vividly recall how I was affected when I heard the voice of our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, as he spoke from thousands of miles away. Just to hear his voice seemed to lift much of the sadness and gloom I was feeling. I will always remember and treasur</span>
