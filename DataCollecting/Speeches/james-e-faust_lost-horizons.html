  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="President Oaks, members of the faculty, my beloved and choice young friends: I am grateful for the presence of the most important person in my life. I know that it’s not appropriate to brag about your relatives, but I’m not related to her; I’m just married to her.

I have a desire this morning to be objective in what I say to you, and I think, in my desire to be objective, I also have a concern that I might not be invited back again to speak to you. I have not been privileged to attend this great institution, which memorializes the name of Brigham Young, but my interest in and concern for this university and its students are very great; and if BYU is going to be worthy of its name, it has the responsibility to expand the horizons of all who attend this institution, for Brigham Young himself was a man of endless vision. There is currently a rerun of the movie called &lt;i&gt;Lost Horizon. &lt;/i&gt;If I can, I should like to challenge those who attend this institution to broaden their vision, rather than to limit it, so that there might be no lost horizons for any of the graduates of this great university.

Every time I go into the President’s room at the Hotel Utah, which, as you know, contains the pictures of all of the presidents of the Church, there is a remarkable likeness of Brigham Young looking down from the wall. He always seems to be saying to me, “What are you doing here?”—a question which might appropriately be asked of those of you who are attending BYU. What are you doing here? This great school and its unique faculty are not really on trial, for they have stood the tests of time and excellence; but the students who attend here will be evaluated more and longer than any students who attend any other institution in this state or any other state. This is so because the Spirit of the Lord is here, and therefore it should reflect in the quality of the lives of those who attend here.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two Divergent Reactions to BYU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I have wondered if the great honor of graduating from this institution, named after the great visionary colonizer, has had too much of a tendency to limit the horizons of a small number of those who attend, simply because they have felt that graduation was the crowning achievement of their lives. I’m sure that it is unfairly categorized, and I certainly do not wish to do so, but there are at least two divergent reactions which seem to obtain in some who attend this university. The first reaction can be seen in those few who, after graduation or leaving this institution, seem to feel that they cannot or do not wish to perpetuate in their lives the high ideals and standards of this university and of the Church which supports it. There are some of those in the law school which I attended, who have turned out to be good lawyers and otherwise good men but are spiritually inactive and have therefore limited their horizons.

The next category consists of those few at the opposite end of the spectrum who project the feeling, either consciously or unconsciously, that, simply because they have attended this university, somehow they have achieved, have arrived, and are fully satisfied with their achievements, as well as being a little self-righteous therefore, and whose vision has been limited and many horizons unseen. There must never be a lack of inner vision in the students or an inadequate challenge by the faculty at this university. Elder Hugh B. Brown reminds us, “If you have a desire to be mediocre, you will probably find that you have already achieved your ambition.” Everyone would probably agree that most of the students at Brigham Young University are on the right track, but Arthur Godfrey has said, “Even if you’re on the right track, you will get run over if you just stand there.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Understanding Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Having recently come into the body of your leaders, I have a persuasion that the Brethren have been called, not because of their great intellects, although many have such, or their vast experience, although most have such, or their great learning, and all are learned according to the standards of the world. Based on their treatment of me, I am persuaded that in a large measure they have been called because of the understanding of their hearts. In this area they are not wanting. The Lord has made it clear that he requires an understanding heart and a willing mind. It is to be hoped that at this great University, while cultural and intellectual pursuits take their proper place, the feelings of the heart will be included in the curriculum and therefore not become one of the lost horizons.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overcome Adversity with Work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Rossiter Raymond has said that “a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight,” and unfortunately the first range of hills which encircle the scanty vale is the horizon for the majority of its inhabitants. Heslop wisely counseled, “Don’t always look at the objects which are near and never on the horizon.” A thoughtful woman, Phoebe Cary, reminds us, “An inner vision, quick to find the beauties hidden from common sight,” ought also to be part of the bill of fare of this university.

One of my friends, whom you would know if I should name him, recently had a son graduate from Harvard University. His other son has an advanced degree from Stanford. My friend began his illustrious career as a paperboy of one of the great newspapers, of which he is now the president, and subsequent to his having been a paperboy he worked for one of the big railroads. He has had all of the advantage of knowing the blessings of adversity. I queried him with a sincere pondering: “I wonder if your sons are as well educated as you were at their age?” I myself am very grateful to a father who did not overindulge his sons except with love and moral support. I think I have a special appreciation for many things, because of having worked at a canning factory in Murray and having caught hot cans as they came from the capper—for the munificent sum of twenty-five cents per hour. One of the fringe benefits of that job was to have the flesh of the hands peel off because of the wet and the heat of the cans. It also involved a ten-mile bike ride every day to get to and from work.

There is in the Church today a truly remarkable family. They are the children of Patriarch and Sister Alexander R. Curtis, who used to run a coal yard in Sugarhouse. To my knowledge, no family in the Church has produced so many bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and regional representatives of the Twelve. There are presently three sons serving as regional representatives of the Twelve. One of them, President A. Ray Curtis, when asked to what he attributed his success, answered that it was the coal shovel his father put in his hands when he was a boy.

There are some advantages if you have to work and struggle and deny yourselves here at Brigham Young University. It may very well be that the most beneficial part of your college education is to learn to work. You will find that in time you will outstrip those other students who will arrive on this campus next week or next month driving a Thunderbird their parents have bought for them. We are indebted to Henry Ward Beecher for the marvelous thought that “affliction comes to us all, not to make us sad, but sober; not to make us sorry, but wise. It is trial that proves one thing weak and another strong. A cobweb is as good as the mightiest cable when there is no strain upon it.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excellence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the marvels of the surpassing craftsmanship so evident in so many places in the Salt Lake Temple makes one wonder if one of the lost horizons in your day is not a loss of excellence in personal performance. Paul counseled the Philippians well: “Approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ” (Philippians 1:10). The challenge to follow a more excellent way appears in two more significant scriptures. In Paul’s writings to the Corinthians he says, “Covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way” (1 Corinthians 12:31). In Ether, the challenge is more spiritual: “In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way” (Ether 12:11). One takes no offense in the pride of Michelangelo, who carved across the bodice of the &lt;i&gt;Pietà &lt;/i&gt;this reminder to all who gaze upon this exquisite and sublime work of art: “Michelangelo Buonarroti of Florence made this.”

Stradivarius too had a working knowledge of excellence. One of the horizons which profitably can be expanded in all of us is spiritual excellence. I would surmise that all who attend this great institution have a desire to see the face of the Savior. This is an available blessing, for he has said, “It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am” (D&amp;amp;C 93:1).

Another lost horizon of spiritual excellence is that of a want of personal integrity, or just plain honesty in one’s dealings. A knowledge and practice of first-rate honesty is far more important than a knowledge of logarithms or the periodic tables of the elements of the earth. It would be hoped that first-rate honesty would be one of the principles taught constantly at this institution of higher learning. The element of honesty in fine test is that of being true to one’s own being. Shakespeare, speaking through Polonius, said:

&lt;i&gt;This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.&lt;/i&gt; [Hamlet, I.iii].
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confidence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
May I mention briefly three other horizons, which hopefully are never lost in the individual students at Brigham Young University. First is confidence in yourselves. Recently one of the Twelve with some others sat in a group of former recipients of a special scholarship of the universities of this state. Each recounted what the scholarship had meant in his or her life. Invariably appreciation was expressed for the money itself, because, I’m sure, of the great need. But quite often appreciation was also expressed for the self-confidence it gave to the recipient. Excellence comes into being, riding on the confidence one has in oneself.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical Soundness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Another lost horizon may be in physical soundness. More than a strengthening of muscles, there comes a strengthening of resolve, self-discipline, and carriage in participating in athletic endeavors. My brother Gus and I occasionally had to walk five miles from Granite High School to Cottonwood where we lived, after having participated in a scrimmage or training for a track meet. To many, including my own children, this seems not only foolish but downright stupid, and as I look back on it I have some misgivings myself. But there was a certain satisfaction in having persevered in an overwhelming physical challenge.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The last horizon, which hopefully is never lost in our lives, is that of service. I speak of service to your family and to others, service to your calling, service to your profession, service to your community and your country. Most of the expanding horizons of all of us involve service and dedication. I humbly challenge all to remember that mere attendance at Brigham Young University, or for that matter Harvard University or the University of Utah, is not a substitute for excellence or endeavor. There is an unquestioned mark of distinction in being part of the student body of this great institution, but equating mere admission at Brigham Young University with achievement is an improper equation.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Journey, Not a Destination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of my beloved uncles went on a mission in 1912–14 to an enlightened nation in Europe. He found great satisfaction and fulfillment in being part of the great missionary activity and in his involvement with the Saints. After his mission he remained very loyal to the Church but became somewhat inactive because he had a Word of Wisdom problem. My brothers and I used to thrill in hearing him tell about his mission. He would tell us by the hour about his mission president, his companions, the Saints, the country, and its culture. His mission was, in many ways, the highwater mark of his life. He was thrilled when we went on our missions. He treasured missionary experience; it became the destination of his life rather than a journey.

An appropriate question to ask youth is whether your attendance at Brigham Young University is your destination or whether it is part of your eternal journey. In World War II we flew over the oases of the great Sahara Desert. Often we were low enough to the sand to see the drovers guiding their lumbering camels to and from these sanctuaries from thirst. In a measure, this great university and its environment is an oasis in the real world. As at an oasis in the desert, there should be those pilgrims who are coming from the real world to this campus and leaving this campus again to go back into the real world, even to distant lands. Members of this Church should be the leaven of the world, and if we are therefore not out in the world how can we provide the yeast? I am told that a few recruiters may be boycotting Brigham Young University because its graduates and/or their wives do not want to leave the oasis, or, having left it, always want to return. One of the mottoes of this university is “The world is our campus.” If the world is our campus, then should not the world also be our area of influence? Alma reminds us that “the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, . . . all that he seeth fit that they should have” (Alma 29:8). This must be constantly kept in mind by the students and the graduates of this university.

We are not saved by the role we play in life or by the geographic area where we live. The word of the Lord came unto Jonah saying, “Arise, go to Nineveh” (Jonah 1:2). There will be many of you who should go to Nineveh. You will recall that Jonah recoiled from that idea and went to Joppa, to go on to Tarshish, to get away from the presence of the Lord. And wherever your Nineveh may be, you will find that the presence of the Lord will be there. Jonah found that the Lord had other ideas for him, and three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish which swallowed him changed his mind about a number of things.

I bear my testimony to the divinity of the work which caused this great institution to be founded and to flourish, and to the reality of Jesus of Nazareth, our divine Redeemer, who should be our constant companion in the classrooms and assemblies, and even when we walk on the paths of Brigham Young University. And because of his influence on this campus, I pray that all who pause at this great oasis may have truly expanded horizons in their lives, and that he whose life we seek to emulate will be our continuing model. I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>President Oaks, members of the faculty, my beloved and choice young friends: I am grateful for the presence of the most important person in my life. I know that it’s not appropriate to brag about your relatives, but I’m not related to her; I’m just married to her.</p>
<p>I have a desire this morning to be objective in what I say to you, and I think, in my desire to be objective, I also have a concern that I might not be invited back again to speak to you. I have not been privileged to attend this great institution, which memorializes the name of Brigham Young, but my interest in and concern for this university and its students are very great; and if BYU is going to be worthy of its name, it has the responsibility to expand the horizons of all who attend this institution, for Brigham Young himself was a man of endless vision. There is currently a rerun of the movie called <i>Lost Horizon. </i>If I can, I should like to challenge those who attend this institution to broaden their vision, rather than to limit it, so that there might be no lost horizons for any of the graduates of this great university.</p>
<p>Every time I go into the President’s room at the Hotel Utah, which, as you know, contains the pictures of all of the presidents of the Church, there is a remarkable likeness of Brigham Young looking down from the wall. He always seems to be saying to me, “What are you doing here?”—a question which might appropriately be asked of those of you who are attending BYU. What are you doing here? This great school and its unique faculty are not really on trial, for they have stood the tests of time and excellence; but the students who attend here will be evaluated more and longer than any students who attend any other institution in this state or any other state. This is so because the Spirit of the Lord is here, and therefore it should reflect in the quality of the lives of those who attend here.</p>
<h2><b>Two Divergent Reactions to BYU</b></h2>
<p>I have wondered if the great honor of graduating from this institution, named after the great visionary colonizer, has had too much of a tendency to limit the horizons of a small number of those who attend, simply because they have felt that graduation was the crowning achievement of their lives. I’m sure that it is unfairly categorized, and I certainly do not wish to do so, but there are at least two divergent reactions which seem to obtain in some who attend this university. The first reaction can be seen in those few who, after graduation or leaving this institution, seem to feel that they cannot or do not wish to perpetuate in their lives the high ideals and standards of this university and of the Church which supports it. There are some of those in the law school which I attended, who have turned out to be good lawyers and otherwise good men but are spiritually inactive and have therefore limited their horizons.</p>
<p>The next category consists of those few at the opposite end of the spectrum who project the feeling, either consciously or unconsciously, that, simply because they have attended this university, somehow they have achieved, have arrived, and are fully satisfied with their achievements, as well as being a little self-righteous therefore, and whose vision has been limited and many horizons unseen. There must never be a lack of inner vision in the students or an inadequate challenge by the faculty at this university. Elder Hugh B. Brown reminds us, “If you have a desire to be mediocre, you will probably find that you have already achieved your ambition.” Everyone would probably agree that most of the students at Brigham Young University are on the right track, but Arthur Godfrey has said, “Even if you’re on the right track, you will get run over if you just stand there.”</p>
<h2><b>An Understanding Heart</b></h2>
<p>Having recently come into the body of your leaders, I have a persuasion that the Brethren have been called, not because of their great intellects, although many have such, or their vast experience, although most have such, or their great learning, and all are learned according to the standards of the world. Based on their treatment of me, I am persuaded that in a large measure they have been called because of the understanding of their hearts. In this area they are not wanting. The Lord has made it clear that he requires an understanding heart and a willing mind. It is to be hoped that at this great University, while cultural and intellectual pursuits take their proper place, the feelings of the heart will be included in the curriculum and therefore not become one of the lost horizons.</p>
<h2><b>Overcome Adversity with Work</b></h2>
<p>Rossiter Raymond has said that “a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight,” and unfortunately the first range of hills which encircle the scanty vale is the horizon for the majority of its inhabitants. Heslop wisely counseled, “Don’t always look at the objects which are near and never on the horizon.” A thoughtful woman, Phoebe Cary, reminds us, “An inner vision, quick to find the beauties hidden from common sight,” ought also to be part of the bill of fare of this university.</p>
<p>One of my friends, whom you would know if I should name him, recently had a son graduate from Harvard University. His other son has an advanced degree from Stanford. My friend began his illustrious career as a paperboy of one of the great newspapers, of which he is now the president, and subsequent to his having been a paperboy he worked for one of the big railroads. He has had all of the advantage of knowing the blessings of adversity. I queried him with a sincere pondering: “I wonder if your sons are as well educated as you were at their age?” I myself am very grateful to a father who did not overindulge his sons except with love and moral support. I think I have a special appreciation for many things, because of having worked at a canning factory in Murray and having caught hot cans as they came from the capper—for the munificent sum of twenty-five cents per hour. One of the fringe benefits of that job was to have the flesh of the hands peel off because of the wet and the heat of the cans. It also involved a ten-mile bike ride every day to get to and from work.</p>
<p>There is in the Church today a truly remarkable family. They are the children of Patriarch and Sister Alexander R. Curtis, who used to run a coal yard in Sugarhouse. To my knowledge, no family in the Church has produced so many bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and regional representatives of the Twelve. There are presently three sons serving as regional representatives of the Twelve. One of them, President A. Ray Curtis, when asked to what he attributed his success, answered that it was the coal shovel his father put in his hands when he was a boy.</p>
<p>There are some advantages if you have to work and struggle and deny yourselves here at Brigham Young University. It may very well be that the most beneficial part of your college education is to learn to work. You will find that in time you will outstrip those other students who will arrive on this campus next week or next month driving a Thunderbird their parents have bought for them. We are indebted to Henry Ward Beecher for the marvelous thought that “affliction comes to us all, not to make us sad, but sober; not to make us sorry, but wise. It is trial that proves one thing weak and another strong. A cobweb is as good as the mightiest cable when there is no strain upon it.”</p>
<h2><b>Excellence</b></h2>
<p>One of the marvels of the surpassing craftsmanship so evident in so many places in the Salt Lake Temple makes one wonder if one of the lost horizons in your day is not a loss of excellence in personal performance. Paul counseled the Philippians well: “Approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ” (Philippians 1:10). The challenge to follow a more excellent way appears in two more significant scriptures. In Paul’s writings to the Corinthians he says, “Covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way” (1 Corinthians 12:31). In Ether, the challenge is more spiritual: “In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way” (Ether 12:11). One takes no offense in the pride of Michelangelo, who carved across the bodice of the <i>Pietà </i>this reminder to all who gaze upon this exquisite and sublime work of art: “Michelangelo Buonarroti of Florence made this.”</p>
<p>Stradivarius too had a working knowledge of excellence. One of the horizons which profitably can be expanded in all of us is spiritual excellence. I would surmise that all who attend this great institution have a desire to see the face of the Savior. This is an available blessing, for he has said, “It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am” (D&amp;C 93:1).</p>
<p>Another lost horizon of spiritual excellence is that of a want of personal integrity, or just plain honesty in one’s dealings. A knowledge and practice of first-rate honesty is far more important than a knowledge of logarithms or the periodic tables of the elements of the earth. It would be hoped that first-rate honesty would be one of the principles taught constantly at this institution of higher learning. The element of honesty in fine test is that of being true to one’s own being. Shakespeare, speaking through Polonius, said:</p>
<p><i>This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.</i> [Hamlet, I.iii].</p>
<h2><b>Confidence</b></h2>
<p>May I mention briefly three other horizons, which hopefully are never lost in the individual students at Brigham Young University. First is confidence in yourselves. Recently one of the Twelve with some others sat in a group of former recipients of a special scholarship of the universities of this state. Each recounted what the scholarship had meant in his or her life. Invariably appreciation was expressed for the money itself, because, I’m sure, of the great need. But quite often appreciation was also expressed for the self-confidence it gave to the recipient. Excellence comes into being, riding on the confidence one has in oneself.</p>
<h2><b>Physical Soundness</b></h2>
<p>Another lost horizon may be in physical soundness. More than a strengthening of muscles, there comes a strengthening of resolve, self-discipline, and carriage in participating in athletic endeavors. My brother Gus and I occasionally had to walk five miles from Granite High School to Cottonwood where we lived, after having participated in a scrimmage or training for a track meet. To many, including my own children, this seems not only foolish but downright stupid, and as I look back on it I have some misgivings myself. But there was a certain satisfaction in having persevered in an overwhelming physical challenge.</p>
<h2><b>Service</b></h2>
<p>The last horizon, which hopefully is never lost in our lives, is that of service. I speak of service to your family and to others, service to your calling, service to your profession, service to your community and your country. Most of the expanding horizons of all of us involve service and dedication. I humbly challenge all to remember that mere attendance at Brigham Young University, or for that matter Harvard University or the University of Utah, is not a substitute for excellence or endeavor. There is an unquestioned mark of distinction in being part of the student body of this great institution, but equating mere admission at Brigham Young University with achievement is an improper equation.</p>
<h2><b>A Journey, Not a Destination</b></h2>
<p>One of my beloved uncles went on a mission in 1912–14 to an enlightened nation in Europe. He found great satisfaction and fulfillment in being part of the great missionary activity and in his involvement with the Saints. After his mission he remained very loyal to the Church but became somewhat inactive because he had a Word of Wisdom problem. My brothers and I used to thrill in hearing him tell about his mission. He would tell us by the hour about his mission president, his companions, the Saints, the country, and its culture. His mission was, in many ways, the highwater mark of his life. He was thrilled when we went on our missions. He treasured missionary experience; it became the destination of his life rather than a journey.</p>
<p>An appropriate question to ask youth is whether your attendance at Brigham Young University is your destination or whether it is part of your eternal journey. In World War II we flew over the oases of the great Sahara Desert. Often we were low enough to the sand to see the drovers guiding their lumbering camels to and from these sanctuaries from thirst. In a measure, this great university and its environment is an oasis in the real world. As at an oasis in the desert, there should be those pilgrims who are coming from the real world to this campus and leaving this campus again to go back into the real world, even to distant lands. Members of this Church should be the leaven of the world, and if we are therefore not out in the world how can we provide the yeast? I am told that a few recruiters may be boycotting Brigham Young University because its graduates and/or their wives do not want to leave the oasis, or, having left it, always want to return. One of the mottoes of this university is “The world is our campus.” If the world is our campus, then should not the world also be our area of influence? Alma reminds us that “the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, . . . all that he seeth fit that they should have” (Alma 29:8). This must be constantly kept in mind by the students and the graduates of this university.</p>
<p>We are not saved by the role we play in life or by the geographic area where we live. The word of the Lord came unto Jonah saying, “Arise, go to Nineveh” (Jonah 1:2). There will be many of you who should go to Nineveh. You will recall that Jonah recoiled from that idea and went to Joppa, to go on to Tarshish, to get away from the presence of the Lord. And wherever your Nineveh may be, you will find that the presence of the Lord will be there. Jonah found that the Lord had other ideas for him, and three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish which swallowed him changed his mind about a number of things.</p>
<p>I bear my testimony to the divinity of the work which caused this great institution to be founded and to flourish, and to the reality of Jesus of Nazareth, our divine Redeemer, who should be our constant companion in the classrooms and assemblies, and even when we walk on the paths of Brigham Young University. And because of his influence on this campus, I pray that all who pause at this great oasis may have truly expanded horizons in their lives, and that he whose life we seek to emulate will be our continuing model. I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Welcome to fall semester 2017. I hope you have a wonderful experience this year at BYU. I remember my first semester here as a student. I was thrilled at the thought that I was finally going to further my education, but, at the same time, I have to admit I was somewhat anxious. The prospect of being a student at BYU was daunting. I was a nontraditional student returning to school when our youngest child was in kindergarten. I remember looking at the syllabus of each class and wondering if I could do everything that was required.
I had chosen English as a major and was looking forward to attending all of the classes. I hoped I could keep up. I say I was looking forward to attending all of the classes, and that is mostly true, but there was one exception: intermediate algebra.
Algebra and I have a dubious history. Algebra was a required course in junior high and in high school, and I learned quickly that algebra was not one of my strong points. I did manage, however, to pass those precollege algebra classes—mainly by doing extra-credit assignments given to me by sympathetic algebra teachers. So, knowing what I knew about my history with algebra and knowing that I would have to take the intermediate algebra class in order to graduate from BYU, I did the only thing I could think of: I procrastinated.
The problem with procrastination is that whatever you choose to procrastinate never seems to go away. Instead it looms large. The time finally came when I could procrastinate no longer. It was the last semester of my senior year—the proverbial eleventh hour. I finally registered for the algebra class, attended the first day of class, and immediately knew I was in over my head.
My friend Mary, who is a mathematical whiz, could sense my panic. She suggested that I drop the class and register for the independent study algebra course. She said she would tutor me. I was so grateful to her.
That was the beginning of what my family calls “the year that Mom took algebra.” It consumed a lot of my time. Passing my algebra class became a family project. Not only did I have the help of my friend Mary, who tutored me, but I also had Kevin’s help and the help of my two sons. They spent hours helping me with my homework. They truly endured this experience with me.
When I wasn’t working on my homework, it seemed like I was expressing my discontent to anyone who would listen. In other words, I complained a lot. I remember complaining to my mother about the fact that I was an English major and that I didn’t understand why I even had to take algebra.
In a very reassuring, motherly way, she said, “Peggy, you never know when you are going to need algebra.”
I am sure she thought it was good counsel, but I was forty-three years old and had somehow managed to get by without algebra up to that point in my</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">March 20 of this year was a beautiful day. It was warm and the sun was shining. Some of the trees had started to bud, and early blooms were visible. I had been anticipating this day with great excitement and a good deal of apprehension from the time I received a phone call three months earlier asking if I would play the organ at one of the Provo City Center Temple dedication sessions. I had never dreamed I would have a chance to serve in this capacity, for I knew there were scores of talented and accomplished organists in our temple district, and I was also keenly aware of my own inadequacies.
Surprise and shock were some of the feelings I had when I got the call, but in the few seconds it took me to stammer out an acceptance of this assignment, I felt my Heavenly Father’s love. And even though I was very nervous, I sensed that this was one of His tender mercies.
I was to have an experience similar to one that my beautiful paternal grandmother, Ethel Taylor Robinson, had had, and this created a sense of connection to her that I had not felt before. I never met her, as she died in her early thirties, but I knew of her and of her many talents. My home teacher made sure of that. He repeatedly told me what a wonderful musician she was and how much she was loved and missed by our community.
In October 1927 my grandmother directed a stake choir that sang at the dedication of the Mesa Arizona Temple. Although four of the songs she performed with her choir in that dedication were different from the ones I played at the Provo City Center Temple dedication, we both performed the “Hosanna Anthem.” Realizing that we would both perform the same song in a temple of the Lord almost ninety years apart was a very sweet experience.
I had other sweet experiences while our choir prepared and rehearsed. Choir members shared their testimonies and tender feelings about the temple, the gospel, and our Savior both in words and song. Everyone was focused on offering his or her very best to the Lord.
In my personal practices I often felt inadequate and worried when I thought about performing in the celestial room, only a few feet away from the Lord’s apostles and in front of millions of viewers. I tried to calm myself with the feeling that if I put the time into my practice, the Lord would help me. I therefore practiced every day. The footwork with the organ pedals was my biggest challenge. I drilled the arpeggios and foot crossings over and over and over and over—slowly at first, and then I would attempt to speed them up to the performance tempo. Some repetitions went well, and I thought, “I can do this!” But on the very next repetition I would land on a note just adjacent to the one I was aiming for. So I would try again.
One day as I was going through this process, I remembered something I had learned in an acoustics class many years ago when I thought I wanted to be a music teacher. The thought that came i</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As is always the case at the beginning of a new year, I greet you with great pleasure, optimism, and gratitude for our current circumstances and what lies ahead in this winter semester and beyond. Thanks for being with us and for contributing to all that makes Brigham Young University the special and remarkable institution it is. I hope and expect you share my gratitude for these opportunities and also my positive feelings about what we may learn and experience in these first months of 2011.
Last October, during our annual Parents Weekend here on campus, I had the uplifting experience of meeting many parents and also students with whom I was not previously acquainted. I am always encouraged by the inspirational and touching accounts of what brings people to BYU and how they have been blessed and by our shared enthusiasm for this positively unique place.
One mother expressed gratitude that her student could be here while admitting that the adjustment for her daughter had been more difficult than she had anticipated. This thoughtful mother then asked me how our students might increase their chances and opportunities for satisfaction and success at BYU. She was not critical but was anxious to be as helpful as a mother could be in supporting her student in all of the adjustments required by coming to BYU.
The poet Henry David Thoreau once said with respect to achieving satisfaction and success, “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours” (Walden [1854], 18, Conclusion). I believe this to be true—especially at BYU.
This morning I thought I might reflect on observations, personal experiences, and productive approaches we have observed in others that could be responsive to these questions and hopes concerning ways to find happy achievement while here. I have decided to focus on the BYU experience with the realization that most of the seven suggestions I advance also apply to life in general. At the outset, I confess no particular magic in the choice of the number seven, as there are many more topics that might be included if we were to stay here together all day. Likewise, my use of alliteration in naming these notions might be helpful in remembering them, but other phrases could be easily substituted.
Here are the seven I have chosen for today:
Self-Awareness
Self-Control
Service
Spirituality
Scriptures
Scholarship
Standards
None should be surprising and all might be self-evident. More can be said than I can express in our minutes together, but perhaps you will fill in the blanks where they are most needed for you. The order today is not important, but the propositions advanced are. All are significant and deserve our attention. While for purposes of this presentation I will discuss the seven suggestions separately, you will qu</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, I am honored and humbled to stand before you this day. I appreciate the privilege of speaking to you about the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives. We are blessed to be here at Brigham Young University. It is the Lord’s university, and at this season we are very fortunate to be a part of this campus life.
I am a beneficiary of the BYU experience. When I arrived on campus many years ago, I did not realize how my time here would influence my future. After my mission my spiritual foundation was firm. Brigham Young University continued to build upon that foundation. It added the walls and the roof, which in turn created a gospel home for my family and me. I will always be thankful for my experience here.
Well, it is the first week of summer term. In fact, it is only the second day of classes. The good news is that you can’t be more than two days behind in any of your assignments. As you can tell from my biography, I have always been involved in athletics in one aspect or another: I have participated as an athlete, I have coached, and I am currently serving in athletics administration. Athletics have been a major part of my life. I guess one of the main reasons I take pleasure in athletics is that they closely parallel the game of life. The lessons I have learned through my involvement in athletics have guided me through life’s challenges and successes. Allow me to use some comparisons to illustrate my point.
In athletics one competes against an opponent. The challenger may be the opposing team, yourself, or the clock. In life we have the adversary as our opponent. He creates temptations and discourages us when we are trying our best.
In athletics one has a head coach, assistant coaches, trainers, strength coaches, and academic advisors. In life we have parents, teachers, counselors, Church leaders, and the Head Coach—the Lord Jesus Christ.
In athletics one competes to be challenged or to win an award, trophy, ring, or ribbon. In life we compete for educational pursuits, employment, and worldly possessions. We are also striving to live the commandments for our celestial reward.
In athletics during a competition there are momentum changes. One moment you are up by 12, then minutes later you could be down by two. In life we have peaks and valleys. We experience trials, heartaches, and sadness. We also experience success, peace, happiness, and joy.
In athletics there is pressure to perform in front of a stadium full of fans or spectators. In life we feel pressure to act in front of friends, family, and associates.
In athletics the game may dictate the proper way to manage the clock. In life we are often faced with the pressures of managing our time wisely and prioritizing the tasks at hand.
In athletics one develops physical endurance through conditioning and practice, and one must deal with injuries. In life we learn to have perseverance, patience, a</span>
