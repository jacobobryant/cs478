  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is my privilege to be able to say a few words to you. I would like to begin by offering my personal congratulations to the graduates and to the families and friends here today. It is a day of joy and a day when we praise the Lord for the many mercies He has given us.

My husband, John, just had a birthday. As we gathered to give him our gifts, our celebration looked a little different from that of most families. There was very little wrapping paper and ribbon and hardly any tangible evidence of gifts. Instead we presented him with memorizations as our gifts. For as long as I can remember John has discouraged using store-bought presents to celebrate his holidays. Instead he has asked that we memorize a poem, song, or scriptural passage to recite for him. This way our offerings could be described the same as William Shakespeare described mercy: “It is twice blessed; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes” (&lt;i&gt;The Merchant of Venice,&lt;/i&gt; act 4, scene 1, lines 186–87). I know this passage because I once memorized it for John. He has always felt that memorization gives our children and me a chance to give him something that we can also keep for ourselves. It is a gift from the heart.

I have learned that there are many benefits to memorizing. For me, personally, it deepens my understanding of the passage and fixes it in my heart. As you go over and over a passage in your mind, you think about it again and again. The richness of the words, the way they are put together, the possible symbolisms, the clever use of literary devices, and new meanings that you may never have noticed or understood before—all become apparent in the process of memorizing. Memorizing can put words in our hearts as well as in our minds. Learning by heart—which may be somewhat of a dying tradition—means to learn something so deeply that it becomes part of our core: it fills us; it changes us. Often my heart has been filled during early morning runs as I have gone over in my mind the words from “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” (&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1995, 102), “The Living Christ” (&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; April 2000, 2–3), or some scripture or poem I was memorizing.

I had read the family proclamation many times and felt love and appreciation for it. But as I memorized each word and sentence, I began to see how it spoke in detail to each of the cultural ills that plague our society. I felt hope that the eternal truths taught in the proclamation could arm me as I faced current and difficult moral issues. I began to feel greater personal affirmation from apostles and prophets and from the Lord for the family choices I had made over a lifetime. I felt strongly the knowledge that we have a Father in Heaven who has an unfailing plan for us. I felt His matchless love and goodness. I felt, as it explains in Proverbs, that “the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding” and “wisdom entereth into thine heart” (Proverbs 2:6,10). My heart was filled with knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and love. This knowledge encouraged gratitude, personal improvement, and the desire to strengthen others.

This tradition of memorizing and reciting has allowed us as parents additional glimpses into the hearts of our children. As they choose their own passages, we often discover what challenges or joys they are experiencing. We also learn of their wisdom and sometimes of their sense of humor. I remember on John’s 40th birthday when our then 15-year-old daughter presented a poem by Lewis Carroll:

&lt;i&gt;“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“And your hair has become very white;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And yet you incessantly stand on your head—&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Do you think, at your age, it is right?”&lt;/i&gt;

[“You Are Old, Father William,” stanza 1]

Although somewhat dismayed that year at feeling kind of old, my husband was even more delighted at our daughter’s sense of humor. Another time a daughter chose to recite Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 29”: “When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes / I all alone beweep my outcast state” (lines 1–2). This came at a time when she was feeling inadequate and friendless. One child chose a love poem when he was feeling heady and in love. Another memorized section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants and announced to us that she had decided to serve a mission. What our children learn by heart and share with their father becomes an expression of their own heartfelt emotions.

Learning by heart is a rich phrase. Think about the word &lt;i&gt;heart.&lt;/i&gt; We all know that our hearts are central to life. Physically the heart is the life-sustaining organ of our bodies. Likewise, &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt; is used to describe the essential, most vital part of our spiritual being—one’s innermost character, feelings, or inclinations. In a gospel sense the heart is our spiritual core. Hence the scriptures teach that “as [a man] thinketh in his &lt;i&gt;heart,&lt;/i&gt; so is he” (Proverbs 23:7; emphasis added) and that “where your treasure is, there will your &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt; be also” (Matthew 6:21; emphasis added). The gospel must be “written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the &lt;i&gt;heart”&lt;/i&gt; (2 Corinthians 3:3; emphasis added). Over and over in the scriptures prophets remind us, as Alma told his son, to “let the affections of thy &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt; be placed upon the Lord forever” (Alma 37:36; emphasis added). Learning by heart in its richest sense is a gospel duty. It is a twin commandment to remembering. We are to learn spiritual truth by heart and then retain in remembrance what we have placed deep in our hearts.

Many of you here today have spent the last four years (or maybe more) at this wonderful university to become educated. What have you learned by heart? Some of it is factual or informational. Such learning is useful. It helps us solve daily problems and meet immediate needs. Dr. Todd Britsch, former academic vice president of BYU, said:

&lt;i&gt;We remember some data that helps us solve a problem, we direct someone to a particular location, we discuss a painting without a copy of it in front of us, we order a part for a computer without a catalog at hand. In each case we have memorized something that helps us shorten the process of dealing with daily experience. Without this storehouse of facts and data, we would be helpless.&lt;/i&gt;

Other things we learn by heart serve even more profound ends, as Dr. Britsch goes on to describe:

&lt;i&gt;A scripture that aids in counseling a sorrowing friend; a hymn whose words and music express our most profound religious feelings when we are struggling with a matter of faith; . . . a technical point that helps us defend a position that is important for us, our family, or our community.&lt;/i&gt; [Todd A. Britsch, “Memorization: ‘Regurgitation’ or ‘Learning by Heart’?” &lt;i&gt;Focus on Faculty&lt;/i&gt; 5, no. 3 (summer 1997): 2]

Have you deposited rich and worthwhile learning into your memory bank so that when you need to make a withdrawal there will be abundant treasures of knowledge and wisdom available to you? Have you acquired both the skill and the love of learning so that you can continue throughout your life to fill your bank and thus be more serviceable to others?

Learning by heart enables us to pursue lifelong learning and service more fully—which should be an ongoing outcome of a BYU education. &lt;i&gt;The Aims of a BYU Education&lt;/i&gt; states:

&lt;i&gt;BYU should inspire students to keep alive their curiosity and prepare them to continue learning throughout their lives. . . . A BYU degree should educate students in how to learn, teach them that there is much still to learn, and implant in them a love of learning “by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).&lt;/i&gt; [In &lt;i&gt;The Mission of Brigham Young University&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Aims of a BYU Education&lt;/i&gt; (Provo: BYU, 1996), 12]

Brigham Young stated: “We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it; never, never” (&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 3:203). He also taught: “Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family” (&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 14:83).

I am grateful for powerful examples in my life of people who are continually learning and serving—thus making the world a better place by using their vibrant minds and hearts.

John’s 84-year-old mother is one such example. She is currently serving a temple mission—her sixth mission. It is always fun to talk to her because there is such excitement in her voice about each new discovery—be it about our church or a country’s history or the local culture. She has taught herself to speak several languages to be more useful in her temple service. Over the years she has been a great source of suggested reading ideas for my book group because she is continually learning from interesting books. She is the mother of 13 children who follow her example in hungering for knowledge. She is someone who has taken learning to heart.

I likewise saw a pattern of learning by heart in my family that began with my grandpa. It then extended to my dad and now to my generation. My grandfather and father had a love for geography, history, and cultures. They traveled as much as they could and can still recount in great and correct detail names of villages, mountains, rivers, and lakes they have visited. In my home as we grew up we had contests to memorize the county seats of all the counties in the state, then the capitals of all the states in the United States, then the capitals of the countries on each continent. Of course in the process we studied maps, learned about languages and cultures, and visited lots of beautiful places of interest. My grandpa took us on trips and thus began the tradition of filling our hearts with knowledge and memories. He believed in giving his posterity experiences rather than things. My father has continued this.

One of the experiences my dad gave me that has filled my memory bank is climbing mountains together. It was hard work, but he taught me that the spectacular view from the top was more magnificent because I had earned it. He taught me to photograph exquisite scenes in my memory so that I could recall them anytime I needed the serenity of soul they could bring to me. I gained the knowledge that Heavenly Father loved me enough to create this world “to please the eye and to gladden the heart; . . . and to enliven the soul” (D&amp;amp;C 59:18–19).

My dad just returned from Nauvoo, where he served as temple president. He is almost 80 now and sadly admits that he probably won’t stand on top of any of his favorite mountain peaks again. But he has those vistas that he loves so much stored in his memory bank, reminiscent of William Wordsworth’s poem about seeing a host of golden daffodils that Dad so often quoted to me:

&lt;i&gt;I gazed—and gazed—but little thought&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What wealth the show to me had brought:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For oft, when on my couch I lie&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In vacant or in pensive mood,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;They flash upon that inward eye&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Which is the bliss of solitude;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then my&lt;/i&gt; heart &lt;i&gt;with pleasure fills,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And dances with the daffodils.&lt;/i&gt;

[“I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” (1807), stanzas 3–4; emphasis added]

Because my dad memorized those mountain scenes, he can return to them when in “vacant or in pensive mood” and again fill his heart with pleasure.

One of the many things I love about our dear President Hinckley is his bright mind and his love for learning. At the dedication of the remodeled library on this campus, there was much talk about the vast technology we had acquired that would help people distant from the campus access information from our great collection of books. President Hinckley was grateful for that, but then he tenderly held a beautiful book in his hands. He talked of his great love for the heft and feel of a book, about how nothing surpassed the pleasure of holding it and reading from its pages. He inherited a vast library of books from his father, and he knew its contents. Books have become part of him. His daughter Virginia Pearce said of him, “He frequently quotes Shakespeare. He quotes Kipling. Passages of great literature are just floating around in his head” (quoted in Jake Parkinson, “U. Endowment Expands,” &lt;i&gt;Deseret News,&lt;/i&gt; 6 April 2003, A7). This is because he memorized them in his youth and sometimes recited them to his parents—as our children have done for us.

My husband and I have heard lots of other relevant information “pop out” as we had the opportunity to take two ambassadors to visit him—one from the Czech Republic and one from China. In each case we were astounded at the depth of his knowledge of the historical and political events of those lands. He is well read. He is a good thinker. He has a good memory and is wise in his ability to assimilate and utilize his knowledge. This lifelong learning has allowed him to be much more serviceable in the kingdom. He is able to draw treasures of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart well stocked with knowledge.

The BYU &lt;i&gt;Aims&lt;/i&gt; document explains that greater knowledge gives us the ability to be more serviceable:

&lt;i&gt;Well-developed faith, intellect, and character prepare students for a lifetime of . . . service. . . . BYU students strengthen not only themselves—they “also bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind” (Mission Statement).&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Aims,&lt;/i&gt; 12]

I memorized a poem by George Eliot that speaks eloquently about developing ourselves so that we may become one of the “choir invisible” whose lives “bring strength to others”:

&lt;i&gt;O may I join the choir invisible&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of those immortal dead who live again&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In minds made better by their presence: . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . May I . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . be to other souls&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The cup of strength in some great agony,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Beget the smiles that have no cruelty—&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Be the sweet presence of a good diffused,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And in diffusion ever more intense.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;So shall I join the choir invisible&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Whose music is the gladness of the world.&lt;/i&gt;

[“O May I Join the Choir Invisible,” 1867]

Through lifelong learning and service we may “join the choir invisible Whose music is the gladness of the world.” As graduates of BYU we have a special duty so to live. As President Kimball said at the dedication of the Carillon Tower, may “the morality of the graduates of this University provide the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet” (Spencer W. Kimball, “Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells,” Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, 12).

For our lives to become the music of hope for the world, our learning must be heart deep; it must reach our very core. We must be able not only to access information but to understand; we must acquire not only knowledge but wisdom. In this day and age we can look up anything, but it can only change us if we know it in our hearts. T. S. Eliot said, “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? / Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?” (&lt;i&gt;The Rock&lt;/i&gt; [1934], I).

“O remember, remember,” Alma said to each of his sons (Helaman 5:9). Let us “treasure up wisdom” in our hearts (D&amp;amp;C 38:30) by dwelling in our hearts on blessings of protection, comfort, and peace; by pondering in our hearts moments of inspiration and revelation; and, above all, by remembering that we are covenant children of Heavenly Father. We must engrave our covenants in the fleshy tables of our hearts.

It is my hope and my prayer that, as Jeremiah said, God “will put [His] law in [our] inward parts, and write it in [our] hearts” (Jeremiah 31:33). May we learn by heart those things that will continually fill our memory banks with wisdom and then use that wisdom in His service is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>It is my privilege to be able to say a few words to you. I would like to begin by offering my personal congratulations to the graduates and to the families and friends here today. It is a day of joy and a day when we praise the Lord for the many mercies He has given us.</p>
<p>My husband, John, just had a birthday. As we gathered to give him our gifts, our celebration looked a little different from that of most families. There was very little wrapping paper and ribbon and hardly any tangible evidence of gifts. Instead we presented him with memorizations as our gifts. For as long as I can remember John has discouraged using store-bought presents to celebrate his holidays. Instead he has asked that we memorize a poem, song, or scriptural passage to recite for him. This way our offerings could be described the same as William Shakespeare described mercy: “It is twice blessed; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes” (<i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> act 4, scene 1, lines 186–87). I know this passage because I once memorized it for John. He has always felt that memorization gives our children and me a chance to give him something that we can also keep for ourselves. It is a gift from the heart.</p>
<p>I have learned that there are many benefits to memorizing. For me, personally, it deepens my understanding of the passage and fixes it in my heart. As you go over and over a passage in your mind, you think about it again and again. The richness of the words, the way they are put together, the possible symbolisms, the clever use of literary devices, and new meanings that you may never have noticed or understood before—all become apparent in the process of memorizing. Memorizing can put words in our hearts as well as in our minds. Learning by heart—which may be somewhat of a dying tradition—means to learn something so deeply that it becomes part of our core: it fills us; it changes us. Often my heart has been filled during early morning runs as I have gone over in my mind the words from “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” (<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102), “The Living Christ” (<i>Ensign,</i> April 2000, 2–3), or some scripture or poem I was memorizing.</p>
<p>I had read the family proclamation many times and felt love and appreciation for it. But as I memorized each word and sentence, I began to see how it spoke in detail to each of the cultural ills that plague our society. I felt hope that the eternal truths taught in the proclamation could arm me as I faced current and difficult moral issues. I began to feel greater personal affirmation from apostles and prophets and from the Lord for the family choices I had made over a lifetime. I felt strongly the knowledge that we have a Father in Heaven who has an unfailing plan for us. I felt His matchless love and goodness. I felt, as it explains in Proverbs, that “the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding” and “wisdom entereth into thine heart” (Proverbs 2:6,10). My heart was filled with knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and love. This knowledge encouraged gratitude, personal improvement, and the desire to strengthen others.</p>
<p>This tradition of memorizing and reciting has allowed us as parents additional glimpses into the hearts of our children. As they choose their own passages, we often discover what challenges or joys they are experiencing. We also learn of their wisdom and sometimes of their sense of humor. I remember on John’s 40th birthday when our then 15-year-old daughter presented a poem by Lewis Carroll:</p>
<p><i>“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,</i></p>
<p><i>“And your hair has become very white;</i></p>
<p><i>And yet you incessantly stand on your head—</i></p>
<p><i>Do you think, at your age, it is right?”</i></p>
<p>[“You Are Old, Father William,” stanza 1]</p>
<p>Although somewhat dismayed that year at feeling kind of old, my husband was even more delighted at our daughter’s sense of humor. Another time a daughter chose to recite Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 29”: “When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes / I all alone beweep my outcast state” (lines 1–2). This came at a time when she was feeling inadequate and friendless. One child chose a love poem when he was feeling heady and in love. Another memorized section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants and announced to us that she had decided to serve a mission. What our children learn by heart and share with their father becomes an expression of their own heartfelt emotions.</p>
<p>Learning by heart is a rich phrase. Think about the word <i>heart.</i> We all know that our hearts are central to life. Physically the heart is the life-sustaining organ of our bodies. Likewise, <i>heart</i> is used to describe the essential, most vital part of our spiritual being—one’s innermost character, feelings, or inclinations. In a gospel sense the heart is our spiritual core. Hence the scriptures teach that “as [a man] thinketh in his <i>heart,</i> so is he” (Proverbs 23:7; emphasis added) and that “where your treasure is, there will your <i>heart</i> be also” (Matthew 6:21; emphasis added). The gospel must be “written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the <i>heart”</i> (2 Corinthians 3:3; emphasis added). Over and over in the scriptures prophets remind us, as Alma told his son, to “let the affections of thy <i>heart</i> be placed upon the Lord forever” (Alma 37:36; emphasis added). Learning by heart in its richest sense is a gospel duty. It is a twin commandment to remembering. We are to learn spiritual truth by heart and then retain in remembrance what we have placed deep in our hearts.</p>
<p>Many of you here today have spent the last four years (or maybe more) at this wonderful university to become educated. What have you learned by heart? Some of it is factual or informational. Such learning is useful. It helps us solve daily problems and meet immediate needs. Dr. Todd Britsch, former academic vice president of BYU, said:</p>
<p><i>We remember some data that helps us solve a problem, we direct someone to a particular location, we discuss a painting without a copy of it in front of us, we order a part for a computer without a catalog at hand. In each case we have memorized something that helps us shorten the process of dealing with daily experience. Without this storehouse of facts and data, we would be helpless.</i></p>
<p>Other things we learn by heart serve even more profound ends, as Dr. Britsch goes on to describe:</p>
<p><i>A scripture that aids in counseling a sorrowing friend; a hymn whose words and music express our most profound religious feelings when we are struggling with a matter of faith; . . . a technical point that helps us defend a position that is important for us, our family, or our community.</i> [Todd A. Britsch, “Memorization: ‘Regurgitation’ or ‘Learning by Heart’?” <i>Focus on Faculty</i> 5, no. 3 (summer 1997): 2]</p>
<p>Have you deposited rich and worthwhile learning into your memory bank so that when you need to make a withdrawal there will be abundant treasures of knowledge and wisdom available to you? Have you acquired both the skill and the love of learning so that you can continue throughout your life to fill your bank and thus be more serviceable to others?</p>
<p>Learning by heart enables us to pursue lifelong learning and service more fully—which should be an ongoing outcome of a BYU education. <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> states:</p>
<p><i>BYU should inspire students to keep alive their curiosity and prepare them to continue learning throughout their lives. . . . A BYU degree should educate students in how to learn, teach them that there is much still to learn, and implant in them a love of learning “by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 88:118).</i> [In <i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (Provo: BYU, 1996), 12]</p>
<p>Brigham Young stated: “We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it; never, never” (<i>JD</i> 3:203). He also taught: “Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family” (<i>JD</i> 14:83).</p>
<p>I am grateful for powerful examples in my life of people who are continually learning and serving—thus making the world a better place by using their vibrant minds and hearts.</p>
<p>John’s 84-year-old mother is one such example. She is currently serving a temple mission—her sixth mission. It is always fun to talk to her because there is such excitement in her voice about each new discovery—be it about our church or a country’s history or the local culture. She has taught herself to speak several languages to be more useful in her temple service. Over the years she has been a great source of suggested reading ideas for my book group because she is continually learning from interesting books. She is the mother of 13 children who follow her example in hungering for knowledge. She is someone who has taken learning to heart.</p>
<p>I likewise saw a pattern of learning by heart in my family that began with my grandpa. It then extended to my dad and now to my generation. My grandfather and father had a love for geography, history, and cultures. They traveled as much as they could and can still recount in great and correct detail names of villages, mountains, rivers, and lakes they have visited. In my home as we grew up we had contests to memorize the county seats of all the counties in the state, then the capitals of all the states in the United States, then the capitals of the countries on each continent. Of course in the process we studied maps, learned about languages and cultures, and visited lots of beautiful places of interest. My grandpa took us on trips and thus began the tradition of filling our hearts with knowledge and memories. He believed in giving his posterity experiences rather than things. My father has continued this.</p>
<p>One of the experiences my dad gave me that has filled my memory bank is climbing mountains together. It was hard work, but he taught me that the spectacular view from the top was more magnificent because I had earned it. He taught me to photograph exquisite scenes in my memory so that I could recall them anytime I needed the serenity of soul they could bring to me. I gained the knowledge that Heavenly Father loved me enough to create this world “to please the eye and to gladden the heart; . . . and to enliven the soul” (D&amp;C 59:18–19).</p>
<p>My dad just returned from Nauvoo, where he served as temple president. He is almost 80 now and sadly admits that he probably won’t stand on top of any of his favorite mountain peaks again. But he has those vistas that he loves so much stored in his memory bank, reminiscent of William Wordsworth’s poem about seeing a host of golden daffodils that Dad so often quoted to me:</p>
<p><i>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</i></p>
<p><i>What wealth the show to me had brought:</i></p>
<p><i>For oft, when on my couch I lie</i></p>
<p><i>In vacant or in pensive mood,</i></p>
<p><i>They flash upon that inward eye</i></p>
<p><i>Which is the bliss of solitude;</i></p>
<p><i>And then my</i> heart <i>with pleasure fills,</i></p>
<p><i>And dances with the daffodils.</i></p>
<p>[“I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” (1807), stanzas 3–4; emphasis added]</p>
<p>Because my dad memorized those mountain scenes, he can return to them when in “vacant or in pensive mood” and again fill his heart with pleasure.</p>
<p>One of the many things I love about our dear President Hinckley is his bright mind and his love for learning. At the dedication of the remodeled library on this campus, there was much talk about the vast technology we had acquired that would help people distant from the campus access information from our great collection of books. President Hinckley was grateful for that, but then he tenderly held a beautiful book in his hands. He talked of his great love for the heft and feel of a book, about how nothing surpassed the pleasure of holding it and reading from its pages. He inherited a vast library of books from his father, and he knew its contents. Books have become part of him. His daughter Virginia Pearce said of him, “He frequently quotes Shakespeare. He quotes Kipling. Passages of great literature are just floating around in his head” (quoted in Jake Parkinson, “U. Endowment Expands,” <i>Deseret News,</i> 6 April 2003, A7). This is because he memorized them in his youth and sometimes recited them to his parents—as our children have done for us.</p>
<p>My husband and I have heard lots of other relevant information “pop out” as we had the opportunity to take two ambassadors to visit him—one from the Czech Republic and one from China. In each case we were astounded at the depth of his knowledge of the historical and political events of those lands. He is well read. He is a good thinker. He has a good memory and is wise in his ability to assimilate and utilize his knowledge. This lifelong learning has allowed him to be much more serviceable in the kingdom. He is able to draw treasures of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart well stocked with knowledge.</p>
<p>The BYU <i>Aims</i> document explains that greater knowledge gives us the ability to be more serviceable:</p>
<p><i>Well-developed faith, intellect, and character prepare students for a lifetime of . . . service. . . . BYU students strengthen not only themselves—they “also bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind” (Mission Statement).</i> [<i>Aims,</i> 12]</p>
<p>I memorized a poem by George Eliot that speaks eloquently about developing ourselves so that we may become one of the “choir invisible” whose lives “bring strength to others”:</p>
<p><i>O may I join the choir invisible</i></p>
<p><i>Of those immortal dead who live again</i></p>
<p><i>In minds made better by their presence: . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . May I . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . be to other souls</i></p>
<p><i>The cup of strength in some great agony,</i></p>
<p><i>Enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love,</i></p>
<p><i>Beget the smiles that have no cruelty—</i></p>
<p><i>Be the sweet presence of a good diffused,</i></p>
<p><i>And in diffusion ever more intense.</i></p>
<p><i>So shall I join the choir invisible</i></p>
<p><i>Whose music is the gladness of the world.</i></p>
<p>[“O May I Join the Choir Invisible,” 1867]</p>
<p>Through lifelong learning and service we may “join the choir invisible Whose music is the gladness of the world.” As graduates of BYU we have a special duty so to live. As President Kimball said at the dedication of the Carillon Tower, may “the morality of the graduates of this University provide the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet” (Spencer W. Kimball, “Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells,” Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, 12).</p>
<p>For our lives to become the music of hope for the world, our learning must be heart deep; it must reach our very core. We must be able not only to access information but to understand; we must acquire not only knowledge but wisdom. In this day and age we can look up anything, but it can only change us if we know it in our hearts. T. S. Eliot said, “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? / Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?” (<i>The Rock</i> [1934], I).</p>
<p>“O remember, remember,” Alma said to each of his sons (Helaman 5:9). Let us “treasure up wisdom” in our hearts (D&amp;C 38:30) by dwelling in our hearts on blessings of protection, comfort, and peace; by pondering in our hearts moments of inspiration and revelation; and, above all, by remembering that we are covenant children of Heavenly Father. We must engrave our covenants in the fleshy tables of our hearts.</p>
<p>It is my hope and my prayer that, as Jeremiah said, God “will put [His] law in [our] inward parts, and write it in [our] hearts” (Jeremiah 31:33). May we learn by heart those things that will continually fill our memory banks with wisdom and then use that wisdom in His service is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Internationally, BYU is known as “the language university.” The 2017 edition of the pamphlet Y Facts reported that approximately 65 percent of BYU students speak more than one language.
Let me do a quick survey to see if those assembled here today are representative of BYU students in general. If you know more than one language, please raise your hand. [The majority of the audience raised their hand.]
I hope you realize how extraordinary it is that you have been given the gift of being able to communicate in more than one language. Think about it: language is the most complex of all human behaviors, and most of you can communicate in more than one language.
The Complexity of Language
Since we can all read English, I would like to demonstrate the complexity of language by giving you a simple English test. How would you read “St. Paul St.” aloud?
You probably said, “Saint Paul Street.” And your response to this simple task was likely not only correct but automatic. But can you explain to another person the rule for determining what the abbreviation “St.” stands for? Perhaps you would say that “St.” before a noun is an abbreviation for “saint,” and “St.” after a noun is an abbreviation for “street.”
Now test your rule on the following street sign, which I saw near Disneyland in California: “St. College St.”
Oops, there is no saint named College! However, there is a state college, so we will have to refine our rule for pronouncing the abbreviation “St.”
Yes, even simple language is complex. Language is so complex that we are often hard pressed to explain how it operates. Yet we are generally unaware of how complex language is. In some ways language is like the air we breathe: we don’t pay attention to it—unless there is something wrong with it.
Because people don’t pay attention to language unless there is something wrong with it, you should not take compliments about your language skills too seriously. The fact that someone complimented you on your language is an indication that they noticed it—and that happens when there is something wrong with it.
Early in my mission in Austria, I was quite confident of my German language ability. In fact, several members had told me how well I spoke German. Then one Sunday after I said a prayer in sacrament meeting, I overheard some members commenting on my language skills.
One sister offered the critique, “War das nicht lieb? Genau wie ein kleines Kind!” Which means, “Wasn’t that sweet? Just like a little child!”
The sister who made the comment was too kind to ever provide that honest feedback to me personally, so I was grateful that I had overheard the comment she had made to others. Her candid assessment let me know that I needed to improve my language skills.
Another mission experience taught me how complicated it is to translat</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You may wonder, as we gather to recognize and celebrate the end of your university career, why we hold a ceremony that we call a commencement. A commencement is, after all, a beginning, not an end. Some may conclude that this apparent misnomer occurs because university administrators, who organize and name such events, are often so confused that they are never sure whether they are coming or going or beginning or ending. That may be true. However, there are other explanations for this seeming contradiction.
We celebrate the final act of your university education with a commencement ceremony in part to impress upon you the need for perspective. Whether something is a beginning or an ending depends, in large measure, on the perspective from which things are viewed. A newly married couple—reflecting on the hectic events of the wedding day and all the details and planning that led up to it after a long engagement—was heard to say, “Now that we are married, we are finally at the end of all our troubles.”
A wiser, more experienced couple standing nearby responded, “That is true, but the question is, at which end?” Perspective does matter.
While you may have taken your final final exam, while you may never again pull an overnighter to complete a research paper, and while you may no longer need to worry about what grade you receive on an assignment, that does not mean that your education is complete. Calling this ceremony a commencement hopefully serves to remind you that while you are graduating from this university, you have not concluded the learning phase of your life; instead, you are at the other end of that ­process, the beginning—the commencement.
Brigham Young, the founder of this university, put it this way:
We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it: never, never.1
Thus one of the aims of a BYU education is to prepare our students for “lifelong ­learning.”2 And, in that regard, it is important to note that we believe in very long lives. As Brother Brigham explained:
We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information.3
I have met numerous lifelong learners in my life—people who, no matter how much they know or how far along they are in their careers or lives, seem compelled to learn more. One such was Domingo Catricura. Domingo was a student in an Indian law class I team taught at the University of Chile Law School more than twenty years ago. Domingo was in his fifties at the time and was one of about twenty-five non-law students who attended the class along with thirty law students. The non-law students were invited to attend the course because they were leaders in various Mapuche communities—the Mapuches being the largest indigenous group in Chile. They we</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I was born in Mountain View, California, the second of (eventually) eleven children. We settled in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the east side of San Jose, not far from the rolling foothills that are crowned by the imposing Mount Hamilton, home to the Lick Observatory, “the first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory in the world.”1 The weather was usually pleasant, even during the warm, sunny days of summer. As spring yielded to summer, the foothills would turn from a verdant green to a cozy, warm brown. But even on hot days, a cool breeze would flow off the bay every afternoon just as temperatures were peaking for the day.
Our subdivision consisted of a single principal street with four cul-de-sacs branching off toward the east. To the south was a walnut orchard that, in a child’s mind, seemed dark and foreboding—the stuff of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. To the east was a large strawberry field. One day Mom sent my older brother, Jim, and me out to pick strawberries. I remember doing a lot of picking and eating; I don’t remember bringing much home in the bowl she gave us.
Shortly thereafter, bulldozers and earthmovers took over as Interstate 680 came to our neighborhood. The walnut orchard also gave way to construction. “Silicon Valley” had to be built, and it seemed we were in the middle of it.
When I was fourteen years old, my father decided to purchase a microcomputer kit. This seemed like a sensible activity for a systems analyst in Silicon Valley. He chose the Heathkit H-89, and it was as amazing in 1979 as an iPad is today! I am sorry to get a little nerdy here, but I need to paint the picture properly. The H-89 was an all-in-one model with a keyboard and a twelve-inch display built right in. Its brain was an eight-bit Zilog brand Z80 CPU2 that ran at more than two megahertz (that is more than two million clock cycles per second). The kit came standard with 16K of RAM,3 but since Dad bought three expansion packs over time, we eventually had an entire 56K of RAM in which to lose ourselves. (In contrast, a typical smartphone today has billions of bytes of RAM and executes billions of clock cycles each second.)
Dad let us older boys help build the thing, but, as I recall, I was the most zealous deputy in the bunch. We had to bolt and solder all sorts of parts together, and soon enough there was this box—a true marvel of engineering and a testament to not only mankind’s creativity but also our ability to follow complex instructions and manipulate tiny parts. There it was, sitting on our kitchen table with its fan purring, enthusiastically waiting for that next instruction to come in from its mass storage device, a cassette tape recorder. (Yes, it took another upgrade before we could use modern, high-capacity floppy disk technology.4)
The computer was built, so what next? I had to learn how to program it. I knew how it was as</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you—graduates, parents, and other supporters—thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: “Wow! So how do those fit together?” In some ways they don’t. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests—like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>
