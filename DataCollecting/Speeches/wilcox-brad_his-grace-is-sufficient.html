  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am grateful to be here with my wife, Debi, and my two youngest children - who are currently attending BYU - and several other family members who have come to be with us.

It is an honor to be invited to speak to you today. Several years ago I received an invitation to speak at Womens Conference. When I told my wife, she asked, "What have they asked you to speak on?"

I was so excited that I got my words mixed up and said, "They want me to speak about changing strengths into weaknesses."

She thought for a minute and said, "Well, theyve got the right man for the job!"

Shes correct about that. I could give a whale of a talk on that subject, but I think today I had better go back to the original topic and speak about changing weaknesses into strengths and about how the grace of Jesus Christ is sufficient (see&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Ether 12:27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/17.8?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 17:8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2 Corinthians 12:9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) - sufficient to cover us, sufficient to transform us, and sufficient to help us as long as that transformation process takes.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christs Grace Is Sufficient to Cover Us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A BYU student once came to me and asked if we could talk. I said, "Of course. How can I help you?"

She said, "I just dont get grace."

I responded, "What is it that you dont understand?"

She said, "I know I need to do my best and then Jesus does the rest, but I cant even do my best."

She then went on to tell me all the things she &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be doing because shes a Mormon that she wasnt doing.

She continued, "I know that I have to do my part and then Jesus makes up the difference and fills the gap that stands between my part and perfection. But who fills the gap that stands between where I am now and my part?"

She then went on to tell me all the things that she &lt;i&gt;shouldnt&lt;/i&gt; be doing because shes a Mormon, but she was doing them anyway.

Finally I said, "Jesus doesnt make &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt; the difference. Jesus makes &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the difference. Grace is not about filling gaps. It is about filling us."

Seeing that she was still confused, I took a piece of paper and drew two dots - one at the top representing God and one at the bottom representing us. I then said, "Go ahead. Draw the line. How much is our part? How much is Christs part?"

She went right to the center of the page and began to draw a line. Then, considering what we had been speaking about, she went to the bottom of the page and drew a line just above the bottom dot.

I said, "Wrong."

She said, "I knew it was higher. I should have just drawn it, because I knew it."

I said, "No. The truth is, there is no line. Jesus filled the whole space. He paid our debt in full. He didnt pay it all except for a few coins. He paid it all. It is finished."

She said, "Right! Like I dont have to do anything?"

"Oh no," I said, "you have plenty to do, but it is not to fill that gap. We will all be resurrected. We will all go back to Gods presence. What is left to be determined by our obedience is what kind of body we plan on being resurrected with and how comfortable we plan to be in Gods presence and how long we plan to stay there."

Christ asks us to show faith in Him, repent, make and keep covenants, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. By complying, we are not paying the demands of justice - not even the smallest part. Instead, we are showing appreciation for what Jesus Christ did by using it to live a life like His. Justice requires immediate perfection or a punishment when we fall short. Because Jesus took that punishment, He can offer us the chance for ultimate perfection (see &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Matthew 5:48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;3 Nephi 12:48&lt;/a&gt;) and help us reach that goal. He can forgive what justice never could, and He can turn to us now with His own set of requirements (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.7?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 2:7&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;3 Nephi 9:20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

"So whats the difference?" the girl asked. "Whether our efforts are required by justice or by Jesus, they are still required."

"True," I said, "but they are required for a different purpose. Fulfilling Christs requirements is like paying a mortgage instead of rent or like making deposits in a savings account instead of paying off debt. You still have to hand it over every month, but it is for a totally different reason."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christs Grace Is Sufficient to Transform Us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Christs arrangement with us is similar to a mom providing music lessons for her child. Mom pays the piano teacher. How many know what I am talking about? Because Mom pays the debt in full, she can turn to her child and ask for something. What is it? Practice! Does the childs practice pay the piano teacher? No. Does the childs practice repay Mom for paying the piano teacher? No. Practicing is how the child shows appreciation for Moms incredible gift. It is how he takes advantage of the amazing opportunity Mom is giving him to live his life at a higher level. Moms joy is found not in getting repaid but in seeing her gift used - seeing her child improve. And so she continues to call for practice, practice, practice.

If the child sees Moms requirement of practice as being too overbearing ("Gosh, Mom, why do I need to practice? None of the other kids have to practice! Im just going to be a professional baseball player anyway!"), perhaps it is because he doesnt yet see with moms eyes. He doesnt see how much better his life could be if he would choose to live on a higher plane.

In the same way, because Jesus has paid justice, He can now turn to us and say, "Follow me" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Matthew 4:19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), "Keep my commandments" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John 14:15&lt;/a&gt;). If we see His requirements as being way too much to ask ("Gosh! None of the other Christians have to pay tithing! None of the other Christians have to go on missions, serve in callings, and do temple work!"), maybe it is because we do not yet see through Christs eyes. We have not yet comprehended what He is trying to make of us.

Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, "The great Mediator asks for our repentance &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; because we must repay him in exchange for his paying our debt to justice, but because repentance initiates a developmental process that, with the Saviors help, leads us along the path to a saintly character" (&lt;i&gt;The Broken Heart&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 149; emphasis in original).

Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said, referring to President Spencer W. Kimballs explanation, "The repenting sinner must suffer for his sins, but this suffering has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt;" (&lt;i&gt;The Lords Way&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1991], 223; emphasis in original). Lets put that in terms of our analogy: The child must practice the piano, but this practice has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is change.

I have born-again Christian friends who say to me, "You Mormons are trying to &lt;i&gt;earn &lt;/i&gt;your way to heaven."

I say, "No, we are not earning heaven. We are &lt;i&gt;learning&lt;/i&gt; heaven. We are preparing for it (see D&amp;amp;C 78:7). We are practicing for it."

They ask me, "Have you been saved by grace?"

I answer, "Yes. Absolutely, totally, completely, thankfully - yes!"

Then I ask them a question that perhaps they have not fully considered: "Have you been &lt;i&gt;changed&lt;/i&gt; by grace?" They are so excited about being saved that maybe they are not thinking enough about what comes next. They are so happy the debt is paid that they may not have considered why the debt existed in the first place. Latter-day Saints know not only what Jesus has saved us from but also what He has saved us for. As my friend Brett Sanders puts it, "A life impacted by grace eventually begins to look like Christs life." As my friend Omar Canals puts it, "While many Christians view Christs suffering as only a huge favor He did for us, Latter-day Saints also recognize it as a huge investment He made in us." As Moroni puts it, grace isnt just about being saved. It is also about becoming like the Savior (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Moroni 7:48&lt;/a&gt;).

The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can live after we die but that we can live more abundantly (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.10?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John 10:10&lt;/a&gt;). The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can be cleansed and consoled but that we can be transformed (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Romans 8&lt;/a&gt;). Scriptures make it clear that no unclean thing can dwell with God (see &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.26?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Alma 40:26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), but, brothers and sisters, no unchanged thing will even want to.

I know a young man who just got out of prison - again. Each time two roads diverge in a yellow wood, he takes the wrong one - every time. When he was a teenager dealing with every bad habit a teenage boy can have, I said to his father, "We need to get him to EFY." I have worked with that program since 1985. I know the good it can do.

His dad said, "I cant afford that."

I said, "I cant afford it either, but you put some in, and Ill put some in, and then well go to my mom, because she is a real softy."

We finally got the kid to EFY, but how long do you think he lasted? Not even a day. By the end of the first day he called his mother and said, "Get me out of here!" Heaven will not be heaven for those who have not chosen to be heavenly.

In the past I had a picture in my mind of what the final judgment would be like, and it went something like this: Jesus standing there with a clipboard and Brad standing on the other side of the room nervously looking at Jesus.

Jesus checks His clipboard and says, "Oh, shoot, Brad. You missed it by two points."

Brad begs Jesus, "Please, check the essay question one more time! There have to be two points you can squeeze out of that essay." Thats how I always saw it.

But the older I get, and the more I understand this wonderful &lt;i&gt;plan of redemption,&lt;/i&gt; the more I realize that in the final judgment it will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be the unrepentant sinner begging Jesus, "Let me stay." No, he will probably be saying, "Get me out of here!" Knowing Christs character, I believe that if anyone is going to be begging on that occasion, it would probably be Jesus begging the unrepentant sinner, "Please, choose to stay. Please, use my Atonement - not just to be cleansed but to be changed so that you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to stay."

The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can go home but that - miraculously - we can feel at home there. If Christ did not require faith and repentance, then there would be no desire to change. Think of your friends and family members who have chosen to live without faith and without repentance. They dont want to change. They are not trying to abandon sin and become comfortable with God. Rather, they are trying to abandon God and become comfortable with sin. If Jesus did not require covenants and bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, then there would be no way to change. We would be left forever with only willpower, with no access to His power. If Jesus did not require endurance to the end, then there would be no internalization of those changes over time. They would forever be surface and cosmetic rather than sinking inside us and becoming part of us - part of who we are. Put simply, if Jesus didnt require practice, then we would never become pianists.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christs Grace Is Sufficient to Help Us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
"But Brother Wilcox, dont you realize how hard it is to practice? Im just not very good at the piano. I hit a lot of wrong notes. It takes me forever to get it right." Now wait. Isnt that all part of the learning process? When a young pianist hits a wrong note, we dont say he is not worthy to keep practicing. We dont expect him to be flawless. We just expect him to keep trying. Perfection may be his ultimate goal, but for now we can be content with progress in the right direction. Why is this perspective so easy to see in the context of learning piano but so hard to see in the context of learning heaven?

Too many are giving up on the Church because they are tired of constantly feeling like they are falling short. They have tried in the past, but they always feel like they are just not good enough. They dont understand grace.

There are young women who know they are daughters of a Heavenly Father who loves them, and they love Him. Then they graduate from high school, and the values they memorized are put to the test. They slip up. They let things go too far, and suddenly they think it is all over. These young women dont understand grace.

There are young men who grow up their whole lives singing, "I hope they call me on a mission," and then they do actually grow a foot or two and flake out completely. They get their Eagles, graduate from high school, and go away to college. Then suddenly these young men find out how easy it is to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, or reverent. They mess up. They say, "Ill never do it again," and then they do it. They say, "Ill never do it again," and then they do it. They say, "This is stupid. I will never do it again." And then they do it. The guilt is almost unbearable. They dont dare talk to a bishop. Instead, they hide. They say, "I cant do this Mormon thing. Ive tried, and the expectations are just way too high." So they quit. These young men dont understand grace.

I know returned missionaries who come home and slip back into bad habits they thought were over. They break promises made before God, angels, and witnesses, and they are convinced there is no hope for them now. They say, "Well, Ive blown it. There is no use in even trying any more." Seriously? These young people have spent entire missions teaching people about Jesus Christ and His Atonement, and now they think there is no hope for them? These returned missionaries dont understand grace.

I know young married couples who find out after the sealing ceremony is over that marriage requires adjustments. The pressures of life mount, and stress starts taking its toll financially, spiritually, and even sexually. Mistakes are made. Walls go up. And pretty soon these husbands and wives are talking with divorce lawyers rather than talking with each other. These couples dont understand grace.

In all of these cases there should never be just two options: perfection or giving up. When learning the piano, are the only options performing at Carnegie Hall or quitting? No. Growth and development take time. Learning takes time. When we understand grace, we understand that God is long-suffering, that change is a process, and that repentance is a pattern in our lives. When we understand grace, we understand that the blessings of Christs Atonement are continuous and His strength is perfect in our weakness (see &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2 Corinthians 12:9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). When we understand grace, we can, as it says in the Doctrine and Covenants, "continue in patience until [we] are perfected" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67.13?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 67:13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

One young man wrote me the following e-mail: "I know God has all power, and I know He will help me if Im worthy, but Im just never worthy enough to ask for His help. I want Christs grace, but I always find myself stuck in the same self-defeating and impossible position: no work, no grace."

I wrote him back and testified with all my heart that Christ is not waiting at the finish line once we have done "all we can do" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 25:23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). He is with us every step of the way.

Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, "The Saviors gift of grace to us is not necessarily limited in time to after all we can do. We may receive his grace before, during and after the time when we expend our own efforts" (&lt;i&gt;The Broken Heart&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 155). So grace is not a booster engine that kicks in once our fuel supply is exhausted. Rather, it is our constant energy source. It is not the light at the end of the tunnel but the light that moves us through the tunnel. Grace is not achieved somewhere down the road. It is received right here and right now. It is not a finishing touch; it is the Finishers touch (see &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.2?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

In twelve days we celebrate Pioneer Day. The first company of Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Their journey was difficult and challenging; still, they sang:

&lt;i&gt;Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But with joy wend your way.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Though hard to you this journey may appear,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Grace shall be as your day.&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/come-come-ye-saints?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;"Come, Come, Ye Saints," &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 2002, no. 30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]

"Grace shall be as your day" - what an interesting phrase. We have all sung it hundreds of times, but have we stopped to consider what it means? "Grace shall be as your day": grace shall be like a day. As dark as night may become, we can always count on the sun coming up. As dark as our trials, sins, and mistakes may appear, we can always have confidence in the grace of Jesus Christ. Do we earn a sunrise? No. Do we have to be worthy of a chance to begin again? No. We just have to accept these blessings and take advantage of them. As sure as each brand-new day, grace - the enabling power of Jesus Christ - is constant. Faithful pioneers knew they were not alone. The task ahead of them was never as great as the power behind them.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The grace of Christ is sufficient - sufficient to cover our debt, sufficient to transform us, and sufficient to help us as long as that transformation process takes. The Book of Mormon teaches us to rely solely on "the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 2:8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). As we do, we do not discover - as some Christians believe - that Christ requires nothing of us. Rather, we discover the reason He requires so much and the strength to do all He asks (see &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philippians 4:13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Grace is not the absence of Gods high expectations. Grace is the presence of Gods power (see &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/1.37?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Luke 1:37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said the following:

&lt;i&gt;Now may I speak . . . to those buffeted by false insecurity, who, though laboring devotedly in the Kingdom, have recurring feelings of falling forever short. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . This feeling of inadequacy is . . . normal. There is no way the Church can honestly describe where we must yet go and what we must yet do without creating a sense of immense distance. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . This is a gospel of grand expectations, but Gods grace is sufficient for each of us.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CR&lt;/i&gt;, October 1976, 14, 16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;"Notwithstanding My Weakness," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1976, 12, 14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]

With Elder Maxwell, I testify that Gods grace is sufficient. Jesus grace is sufficient. It is enough. It is all we need. Oh, young people, dont quit. Keep trying. Dont look for escapes and excuses. Look for the Lord and His perfect strength. Dont search for someone to blame. Search for someone to help you. Seek Christ, and, as you do, I promise you will feel the enabling power we call His amazing grace. I leave this testimony and all of my love - for I do love you. As God is my witness, I love the youth of this church. I believe in you. Im pulling for you. And Im not the only one. Parents are pulling for you, leaders are pulling for you, and prophets are pulling for you. And Jesus is pulling &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; you. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I am grateful to be here with my wife, Debi, and my two youngest children - who are currently attending BYU - and several other family members who have come to be with us.</p>
<p>It is an honor to be invited to speak to you today. Several years ago I received an invitation to speak at Womens Conference. When I told my wife, she asked, "What have they asked you to speak on?"</p>
<p>I was so excited that I got my words mixed up and said, "They want me to speak about changing strengths into weaknesses."</p>
<p>She thought for a minute and said, "Well, theyve got the right man for the job!"</p>
<p>Shes correct about that. I could give a whale of a talk on that subject, but I think today I had better go back to the original topic and speak about changing weaknesses into strengths and about how the grace of Jesus Christ is sufficient (see<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ether 12:27</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/17.8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;C 17:8</a>, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 12:9</a></span>) - sufficient to cover us, sufficient to transform us, and sufficient to help us as long as that transformation process takes.</p>
<h2><b>Christs Grace Is Sufficient to Cover Us</b></h2>
<p>A BYU student once came to me and asked if we could talk. I said, "Of course. How can I help you?"</p>
<p>She said, "I just dont get grace."</p>
<p>I responded, "What is it that you dont understand?"</p>
<p>She said, "I know I need to do my best and then Jesus does the rest, but I cant even do my best."</p>
<p>She then went on to tell me all the things she <i>should</i> be doing because shes a Mormon that she wasnt doing.</p>
<p>She continued, "I know that I have to do my part and then Jesus makes up the difference and fills the gap that stands between my part and perfection. But who fills the gap that stands between where I am now and my part?"</p>
<p>She then went on to tell me all the things that she <i>shouldnt</i> be doing because shes a Mormon, but she was doing them anyway.</p>
<p>Finally I said, "Jesus doesnt make <i>up</i> the difference. Jesus makes <i>all</i> the difference. Grace is not about filling gaps. It is about filling us."</p>
<p>Seeing that she was still confused, I took a piece of paper and drew two dots - one at the top representing God and one at the bottom representing us. I then said, "Go ahead. Draw the line. How much is our part? How much is Christs part?"</p>
<p>She went right to the center of the page and began to draw a line. Then, considering what we had been speaking about, she went to the bottom of the page and drew a line just above the bottom dot.</p>
<p>I said, "Wrong."</p>
<p>She said, "I knew it was higher. I should have just drawn it, because I knew it."</p>
<p>I said, "No. The truth is, there is no line. Jesus filled the whole space. He paid our debt in full. He didnt pay it all except for a few coins. He paid it all. It is finished."</p>
<p>She said, "Right! Like I dont have to do anything?"</p>
<p>"Oh no," I said, "you have plenty to do, but it is not to fill that gap. We will all be resurrected. We will all go back to Gods presence. What is left to be determined by our obedience is what kind of body we plan on being resurrected with and how comfortable we plan to be in Gods presence and how long we plan to stay there."</p>
<p>Christ asks us to show faith in Him, repent, make and keep covenants, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. By complying, we are not paying the demands of justice - not even the smallest part. Instead, we are showing appreciation for what Jesus Christ did by using it to live a life like His. Justice requires immediate perfection or a punishment when we fall short. Because Jesus took that punishment, He can offer us the chance for ultimate perfection (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 5:48</a></span>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 Nephi 12:48</a>) and help us reach that goal. He can forgive what justice never could, and He can turn to us now with His own set of requirements (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 2:7</a>;<span style="color: #33cccc;"> <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 Nephi 9:20</a></span>).</p>
<p>"So whats the difference?" the girl asked. "Whether our efforts are required by justice or by Jesus, they are still required."</p>
<p>"True," I said, "but they are required for a different purpose. Fulfilling Christs requirements is like paying a mortgage instead of rent or like making deposits in a savings account instead of paying off debt. You still have to hand it over every month, but it is for a totally different reason."</p>
<h2><b>Christs Grace Is Sufficient to Transform Us</b></h2>
<p>Christs arrangement with us is similar to a mom providing music lessons for her child. Mom pays the piano teacher. How many know what I am talking about? Because Mom pays the debt in full, she can turn to her child and ask for something. What is it? Practice! Does the childs practice pay the piano teacher? No. Does the childs practice repay Mom for paying the piano teacher? No. Practicing is how the child shows appreciation for Moms incredible gift. It is how he takes advantage of the amazing opportunity Mom is giving him to live his life at a higher level. Moms joy is found not in getting repaid but in seeing her gift used - seeing her child improve. And so she continues to call for practice, practice, practice.</p>
<p>If the child sees Moms requirement of practice as being too overbearing ("Gosh, Mom, why do I need to practice? None of the other kids have to practice! Im just going to be a professional baseball player anyway!"), perhaps it is because he doesnt yet see with moms eyes. He doesnt see how much better his life could be if he would choose to live on a higher plane.</p>
<p>In the same way, because Jesus has paid justice, He can now turn to us and say, "Follow me" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 4:19</a></span>), "Keep my commandments" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 14:15</a>). If we see His requirements as being way too much to ask ("Gosh! None of the other Christians have to pay tithing! None of the other Christians have to go on missions, serve in callings, and do temple work!"), maybe it is because we do not yet see through Christs eyes. We have not yet comprehended what He is trying to make of us.</p>
<p>Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, "The great Mediator asks for our repentance <i>not</i> because we must repay him in exchange for his paying our debt to justice, but because repentance initiates a developmental process that, with the Saviors help, leads us along the path to a saintly character" (<i>The Broken Heart</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 149; emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said, referring to President Spencer W. Kimballs explanation, "The repenting sinner must suffer for his sins, but this suffering has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is <i>change</i>" (<i>The Lords Way</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1991], 223; emphasis in original). Lets put that in terms of our analogy: The child must practice the piano, but this practice has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is change.</p>
<p>I have born-again Christian friends who say to me, "You Mormons are trying to <i>earn </i>your way to heaven."</p>
<p>I say, "No, we are not earning heaven. We are <i>learning</i> heaven. We are preparing for it (see D&amp;C 78:7). We are practicing for it."</p>
<p>They ask me, "Have you been saved by grace?"</p>
<p>I answer, "Yes. Absolutely, totally, completely, thankfully - yes!"</p>
<p>Then I ask them a question that perhaps they have not fully considered: "Have you been <i>changed</i> by grace?" They are so excited about being saved that maybe they are not thinking enough about what comes next. They are so happy the debt is paid that they may not have considered why the debt existed in the first place. Latter-day Saints know not only what Jesus has saved us from but also what He has saved us for. As my friend Brett Sanders puts it, "A life impacted by grace eventually begins to look like Christs life." As my friend Omar Canals puts it, "While many Christians view Christs suffering as only a huge favor He did for us, Latter-day Saints also recognize it as a huge investment He made in us." As Moroni puts it, grace isnt just about being saved. It is also about becoming like the Savior (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moroni 7:48</a>).</p>
<p>The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can live after we die but that we can live more abundantly (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.10?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 10:10</a>). The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can be cleansed and consoled but that we can be transformed (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8</a>). Scriptures make it clear that no unclean thing can dwell with God (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.26?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma 40:26</a></span>), but, brothers and sisters, no unchanged thing will even want to.</p>
<p>I know a young man who just got out of prison - again. Each time two roads diverge in a yellow wood, he takes the wrong one - every time. When he was a teenager dealing with every bad habit a teenage boy can have, I said to his father, "We need to get him to EFY." I have worked with that program since 1985. I know the good it can do.</p>
<p>His dad said, "I cant afford that."</p>
<p>I said, "I cant afford it either, but you put some in, and Ill put some in, and then well go to my mom, because she is a real softy."</p>
<p>We finally got the kid to EFY, but how long do you think he lasted? Not even a day. By the end of the first day he called his mother and said, "Get me out of here!" Heaven will not be heaven for those who have not chosen to be heavenly.</p>
<p>In the past I had a picture in my mind of what the final judgment would be like, and it went something like this: Jesus standing there with a clipboard and Brad standing on the other side of the room nervously looking at Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus checks His clipboard and says, "Oh, shoot, Brad. You missed it by two points."</p>
<p>Brad begs Jesus, "Please, check the essay question one more time! There have to be two points you can squeeze out of that essay." Thats how I always saw it.</p>
<p>But the older I get, and the more I understand this wonderful <i>plan of redemption,</i> the more I realize that in the final judgment it will <i>not</i> be the unrepentant sinner begging Jesus, "Let me stay." No, he will probably be saying, "Get me out of here!" Knowing Christs character, I believe that if anyone is going to be begging on that occasion, it would probably be Jesus begging the unrepentant sinner, "Please, choose to stay. Please, use my Atonement - not just to be cleansed but to be changed so that you <i>want</i> to stay."</p>
<p>The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can go home but that - miraculously - we can feel at home there. If Christ did not require faith and repentance, then there would be no desire to change. Think of your friends and family members who have chosen to live without faith and without repentance. They dont want to change. They are not trying to abandon sin and become comfortable with God. Rather, they are trying to abandon God and become comfortable with sin. If Jesus did not require covenants and bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, then there would be no way to change. We would be left forever with only willpower, with no access to His power. If Jesus did not require endurance to the end, then there would be no internalization of those changes over time. They would forever be surface and cosmetic rather than sinking inside us and becoming part of us - part of who we are. Put simply, if Jesus didnt require practice, then we would never become pianists.</p>
<h2><b>Christs Grace Is Sufficient to Help Us</b></h2>
<p>"But Brother Wilcox, dont you realize how hard it is to practice? Im just not very good at the piano. I hit a lot of wrong notes. It takes me forever to get it right." Now wait. Isnt that all part of the learning process? When a young pianist hits a wrong note, we dont say he is not worthy to keep practicing. We dont expect him to be flawless. We just expect him to keep trying. Perfection may be his ultimate goal, but for now we can be content with progress in the right direction. Why is this perspective so easy to see in the context of learning piano but so hard to see in the context of learning heaven?</p>
<p>Too many are giving up on the Church because they are tired of constantly feeling like they are falling short. They have tried in the past, but they always feel like they are just not good enough. They dont understand grace.</p>
<p>There are young women who know they are daughters of a Heavenly Father who loves them, and they love Him. Then they graduate from high school, and the values they memorized are put to the test. They slip up. They let things go too far, and suddenly they think it is all over. These young women dont understand grace.</p>
<p>There are young men who grow up their whole lives singing, "I hope they call me on a mission," and then they do actually grow a foot or two and flake out completely. They get their Eagles, graduate from high school, and go away to college. Then suddenly these young men find out how easy it is to <i>not</i> be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, or reverent. They mess up. They say, "Ill never do it again," and then they do it. They say, "Ill never do it again," and then they do it. They say, "This is stupid. I will never do it again." And then they do it. The guilt is almost unbearable. They dont dare talk to a bishop. Instead, they hide. They say, "I cant do this Mormon thing. Ive tried, and the expectations are just way too high." So they quit. These young men dont understand grace.</p>
<p>I know returned missionaries who come home and slip back into bad habits they thought were over. They break promises made before God, angels, and witnesses, and they are convinced there is no hope for them now. They say, "Well, Ive blown it. There is no use in even trying any more." Seriously? These young people have spent entire missions teaching people about Jesus Christ and His Atonement, and now they think there is no hope for them? These returned missionaries dont understand grace.</p>
<p>I know young married couples who find out after the sealing ceremony is over that marriage requires adjustments. The pressures of life mount, and stress starts taking its toll financially, spiritually, and even sexually. Mistakes are made. Walls go up. And pretty soon these husbands and wives are talking with divorce lawyers rather than talking with each other. These couples dont understand grace.</p>
<p>In all of these cases there should never be just two options: perfection or giving up. When learning the piano, are the only options performing at Carnegie Hall or quitting? No. Growth and development take time. Learning takes time. When we understand grace, we understand that God is long-suffering, that change is a process, and that repentance is a pattern in our lives. When we understand grace, we understand that the blessings of Christs Atonement are continuous and His strength is perfect in our weakness (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 12:9</a></span>). When we understand grace, we can, as it says in the Doctrine and Covenants, "continue in patience until [we] are perfected" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;C 67:13</a></span>).</p>
<p>One young man wrote me the following e-mail: "I know God has all power, and I know He will help me if Im worthy, but Im just never worthy enough to ask for His help. I want Christs grace, but I always find myself stuck in the same self-defeating and impossible position: no work, no grace."</p>
<p>I wrote him back and testified with all my heart that Christ is not waiting at the finish line once we have done "all we can do" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 25:23</a></span>). He is with us every step of the way.</p>
<p>Elder Bruce C. Hafen has written, "The Saviors gift of grace to us is not necessarily limited in time to after all we can do. We may receive his grace before, during and after the time when we expend our own efforts" (<i>The Broken Heart</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989], 155). So grace is not a booster engine that kicks in once our fuel supply is exhausted. Rather, it is our constant energy source. It is not the light at the end of the tunnel but the light that moves us through the tunnel. Grace is not achieved somewhere down the road. It is received right here and right now. It is not a finishing touch; it is the Finishers touch (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 12:2</a></span>).</p>
<p>In twelve days we celebrate Pioneer Day. The first company of Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Their journey was difficult and challenging; still, they sang:</p>
<p><i>Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;</i><br />
<i>But with joy wend your way.</i><br />
<i>Though hard to you this journey may appear,</i><br />
<i>Grace shall be as your day.</i><br />
[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/come-come-ye-saints?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Come, Come, Ye Saints," <i>Hymns,</i> 2002, no. 30</a></span>]</p>
<p>"Grace shall be as your day" - what an interesting phrase. We have all sung it hundreds of times, but have we stopped to consider what it means? "Grace shall be as your day": grace shall be like a day. As dark as night may become, we can always count on the sun coming up. As dark as our trials, sins, and mistakes may appear, we can always have confidence in the grace of Jesus Christ. Do we earn a sunrise? No. Do we have to be worthy of a chance to begin again? No. We just have to accept these blessings and take advantage of them. As sure as each brand-new day, grace - the enabling power of Jesus Christ - is constant. Faithful pioneers knew they were not alone. The task ahead of them was never as great as the power behind them.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>The grace of Christ is sufficient - sufficient to cover our debt, sufficient to transform us, and sufficient to help us as long as that transformation process takes. The Book of Mormon teaches us to rely solely on "the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 2:8</a></span>). As we do, we do not discover - as some Christians believe - that Christ requires nothing of us. Rather, we discover the reason He requires so much and the strength to do all He asks (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippians 4:13</a></span>). Grace is not the absence of Gods high expectations. Grace is the presence of Gods power (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/1.37?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 1:37</a></span>).</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said the following:</p>
<p><i>Now may I speak . . . to those buffeted by false insecurity, who, though laboring devotedly in the Kingdom, have recurring feelings of falling forever short. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . This feeling of inadequacy is . . . normal. There is no way the Church can honestly describe where we must yet go and what we must yet do without creating a sense of immense distance. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . This is a gospel of grand expectations, but Gods grace is sufficient for each of us.</i> [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CR</i>, October 1976, 14, 16</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Notwithstanding My Weakness," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1976, 12, 14</a></span>]</p>
<p>With Elder Maxwell, I testify that Gods grace is sufficient. Jesus grace is sufficient. It is enough. It is all we need. Oh, young people, dont quit. Keep trying. Dont look for escapes and excuses. Look for the Lord and His perfect strength. Dont search for someone to blame. Search for someone to help you. Seek Christ, and, as you do, I promise you will feel the enabling power we call His amazing grace. I leave this testimony and all of my love - for I do love you. As God is my witness, I love the youth of this church. I believe in you. Im pulling for you. And Im not the only one. Parents are pulling for you, leaders are pulling for you, and prophets are pulling for you. And Jesus is pulling <i>with</i> you. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters. Thank you for participating in the devotional today. I know it is a busy time of year, with papers, projects, and finals pending. I promise to do my best to reward your time investment with something helpful to you now and throughout your life.
According to a very fun website1 that I found, it was thirty-six years, one month, and ten days ago that, as a freshman student at BYU, I sat where you are sitting today. I listened carefully as President Ezra Taft Benson, then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a talk titled "Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet."2 He shared how we could more faithfully follow the living prophets and better keep the commandments of God.
The Spirit was strong that day, and I was motivated by President Bensons remarks. I thought to myself, "I am going to follow his counsel to be a better follower of the prophets and to be more faithful in keeping the commandments of God. But I can do better than that. From this point on, Im not even going to make any mistakes!"
Now, I know all of you are a lot smarter than I was as a freshman. You can see the impossibility, and perhaps the silliness, of my well-intentioned commitment.
As I was exiting the devotional, I paused to use the restroom. I was concentrating so intently on my new commitment - to not make any mistakes - that I didnt notice the cute little stick figure wearing a triangular dress on the restroom door. It wasnt until I had turned the corner that I realized where I was. There, standing in front of a large mirror, was a young woman brushing her long, black hair. I hadnt even made it out of this very building before I had failed at my new commitment!
Now, as an aside, I am still grateful to this day to that young woman for not calling for security. Can you imagine the look on the security officers faces as I tried to explain that I was concentrating so hard on never making another mistake that had I made a mistake?
In my minds eye I can see and hear the security officers as they would have looked at each other and said, "Yeah, right! Book em, Danno!"
Today I come to you hopefully a little wiser to share some counsel on something I have worked on ever since that day.
The Starfish Story and Our Thoughts
We are told in Proverbs 23:7 that "as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Related to that is this old saying:
Sow a thought, and you reap an act;
Sow an act, and you reap a habit;
Sow a habit, and you reap a character;
Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.3
As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, our destiny is to live eternally with our Savior in the presence of our Heavenly </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I must say I never imagined myself at this podium. But I have imagined myself on this playing floor - and imagined is the right word. Ive wondered what it would have been like to be Danny Ainge, who, during my freshman year at BYU, went coast-to-coast in the closing seconds of a Sweet Sixteen game against Notre Dame and scored over Orlando Woolridge. Ive dreamed what it would be like to drain a three from just inside half-court, like Jimmer Fredette did against Utah. Unfortunately, my actual skill set wasnt a match for such imagined heroics. Im quite sure its not a match for this podium either. Still, I consider it a great honor to have this opportunity to speak to you this morning.
I love this university. I love the cool, crisp air of a late fall football game and the soft, golden light that falls on Y Mountain and Rock Canyon just before sunset. I even love wandering the stacks in the Harold B. Lee Library. BYU has had a great impact on my life.
My first experiences at BYU were in the late 1960s. Each summer my mother, my brother, and I came to BYU from our home in Pebble Beach, California, for spring or summer term so that my mom could work on completing her degree. We lived in Heritage Halls, or, to be more precise, we lived in what is now called "Classic Heritage" when it was almost new Heritage.
My mother ended up completing her English degree, and our home was forever enriched by what she learned at BYU. I mention my moms education at BYU partly because important parts of my thinking on todays topic are derived from her thinking and writing on this topic.1
The Doctrine of Forgiveness
The title of my remarks is "Faith to Forgive Grievous Harms: Accepting the Atonement as Restitution." Now, to some, any talk from a lawyer that focuses on forgiveness may seem odd. Dont lawyers depend upon a lack of forgiveness to function? In lawyerspeak, is a talk on the necessity of forgiveness an admission against interest?
I am convinced that practicing law with civility and integrity is a noble endeavor and fully compatible with a forgiving heart, and Ill have a bit more to say about this later. Indeed, before you become too critical of lawyers, listen to the words of my good friend Jim Gordon: "It is true that some lawyers are dishonest, arrogant, greedy, venal, amoral, ruthless buckets of toxic slime. On the other hand, it is unfair to judge the entire profession by a few hundred thousand bad apples."2 Such quips can be a bit tough for those of us who are attorneys, but how much worse can it get, given the number of us whose parents, when we decided to go to law school, made sure to scrape off their car the "Ask me about my children" bumper sticker?3
Turning to the concept of forgiveness, let me start with a familiar scripture. Matthew 18:2122 reads:

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The New Testament writer Luke described1 a fascinating scene from the Saviors life in which Jesus, sitting at meat in the house of Simon the Pharisee, was approached by a woman who was widely known to have been a sinner. Her behavior, as she approached the Savior, revealed that she must have had some previous interaction with Him of a very personal and life-changing nature, for she tearfully knelt and kissed his feet, literally bathing his feet with her humble tears before wiping them dry with her tresses and applying precious ointment "as a [servant] might do to his master."2
Simon, aware of the womans past indiscretions, inwardly reproved Jesus for allowing a sinner to approach Him in such a manner. Discerning this unrighteous judgment on the part of Simon, Christ artfully rebuked him, and then, speaking to the woman, He said something truly wondrous: "Thy sins are forgiven." Indeed, a miracle had occurred! A miracle more powerful and momentous than the changing of water into wine or the healing of a leper - a miracle tantamount to the raising of one from the grave, for verily a precious daughter of our Heavenly Father had, in very fact, been born again and saved from spiritual death.
On hearing this account, one cannot help but ask, as did the Book of Mormon writer Enos when he heard a similar declaration of forgiveness following a long and tearful night of anguished soul-searching and prayerful pleading: "How is it done?"3 Today I would like to speak to you of what Spencer W. Kimball called "the miracle of forgiveness."4
Two weeks ago I was released as bishop after six years of service, having also served as bishop previously in another ward and as a student branch president prior to that. One of the most marvelous things about serving as a bishop or branch president is sitting in private council with individual members of your congregation and discussing their concerns relating to their personal worthiness and their standing before God; for it is during these sacred times that a bishop receives a large measure of the inspiration and understanding that will come to him by virtue of his calling as a judge in Israel. And I can attest that at such times I have been given to understand more fully the role of the Savior and His Atonement in our Heavenly Fathers plan and the truly miraculous nature of forgiveness.
To fully understand this miracle, we must contemplate the grand and glorious plan of salvation authored by our Father in Heaven. Before we came to this earth we lived as spirits5 with our heavenly parents and siblings, including our Elder Brother Jesus Christ. In that premortal realm a grand council6 was called, and we were presented with our Heavenly Fathers plan, which allowed our further progression. We do not know all the details of that council, but from the scriptures and the writings of latter-day prophets</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, beloved students, faculty, friends, family, and my esteemed brother in the gospel for over 35 years, President Cecil O. Samuelson. I have always treasured our close and respectful relationship, and I say to you, President Samuelson, that Brigham Young could not have selected a better leader than you, who has reached great heights in medicine, in life, and, above all, in integrity. Thank you for such a generous introduction, and thank you to the beautiful choir from whom we have just heard. I am so privileged to be invited to this world-class university. My wife, Karen, and I thank you.
I am truly honored to be here today. May I begin with this simple sentence: God did not put us here to fail. I would say to you, have faith in yourself - believe in what you are doing, and, most important, be a person of integrity. It is totally up to you, and no one else, how your life evolves. Many would like to think that our parents, our professors, or even our bishops are responsible for our future. What we become, who we are, and the footprint we will leave in life is based entirely on our own determination, hard work, education, and sacrifice. Our Heavenly Father expects the best from each of us. We must believe in ourselves. Dont give in when the going gets rough. You are laying the foundation of a great work, and that great work is your life. Never cut corners, demean other people, or waste time "hanging out." Decide who you are and what your goals entail - then go for the roses. Life has little regard for those who waste time.
My father and grandfather were rural schoolteachers in southern Idaho and Utah, and it was my hope to someday follow their example. But I refused to forsake my dreams, and each day my mind was filled with new ideas and hopes and aspirations. I would never listen to anyone who spoke negatively nor acknowledge that there were shortcomings that could not be overcome. I always thought that the key to life is finding happiness in any given place or time while remembering the great scriptural axiom "Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).
People around us cheer when we are happy and positive. Self-pity is the most negative quality of the human spirit. Thus when one is happy and positive and truly believes in himself or herself, great achievements lie ahead.
Throughout my life, in my heart and soul, I wanted to explore the world - to reach into the unknown - to travel beyond my childhood boundaries. It is so important that we each live our own dream - not someone elses dream. If what you are doing in your life is not your own dream, then whose is it?
Perhaps I can best explain this through a personal experience.
When I was the age of many of you and was attending college at the very challenging Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, things werent going great, at least not academically. It was a struggle for me simply because I didnt apply m</span>
