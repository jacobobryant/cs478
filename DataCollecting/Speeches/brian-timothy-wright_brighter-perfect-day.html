  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Picture in your minds an image of the sun with its rays peeking over the mountains and the sky lit up like a fire. Few visions can surpass the beauty of this scene. In your mind’s eye, is this sun setting or rising?

Few moments in life are anticipated as much as graduation from college and the celebration of the hard work that was required. Few experiences can surpass the poignancy of this moment. Again, is your sun setting or rising? The difference between the two is important, since one gives way to darkness while the other leads to more light.

In the Doctrine and Covenants it is written:

&lt;i&gt;That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Truth is light. We need light in order to see, because it carries information from the world to our eyes.

If this time of commencement is to be the dawn of our future growth, we must seek out opportunities to expand our knowledge. As a famous phrase states, “Education is not so much the filling of a bucket as the lighting of a fire.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Fire, as a source of light, needs constant fueling to burn. From our education here we have learned that the real key to learning is the maintenance of this fire—the thirst for more light.

Just as the light of day requires a window to pass into our homes, the light of truth requires a conduit to pass into our souls. We have discovered here at Brigham Young University that the sciences, humanities, and arts are some of the many conduits that invite truth into our lives, because all things testify of Christ.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Light and knowledge may be acquired in two different ways. One way is to receive light by having others refer us to that knowledge; the second is to seek out conduits for this light on our own. Our education here at Brigham Young University has trained us to employ both of these methods.

While studying here, we have relied heavily on enlightened professors who have encouraged us—by shining example—to “seek . . . out of the best books words of wisdom.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; As I have read great recommended works, such as Gogol’s &lt;i&gt;Dead Souls&lt;/i&gt; or Dostoyevsky’s &lt;i&gt;Crime and Punishment,&lt;/i&gt; the light of truth has reflected into my heart and expanded my soul.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; My mind has been ignited to such a point that my wife and I have placed a quote from Erasmus on our bulletin board: “When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; This is also a feeling that most of us starving graduates have experienced at the beginning of each semester.

As we have pored over textbooks and other materials, our minds have been enlightened and our lives have grown brighter and brighter. This change was barely noticeable at the time, as we learned “line upon line, precept upon precept”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;—just as darkness steadily turns into day with the gradual rising of the sun. Looking back now, we can notice the change in light, but we have not yet grown unto “the perfect day.”

From here we will need to discover our own individual ways of obtaining light through the second method I mentioned: our own experiences. It is hoped that our experiences here have prepared us well for this. A few years ago I made a personal goal to learn how to play the violin. Initially it seemed that instead of light I had discovered the purest conduit of pain for my roommates and family as I practiced. However, eventually it was a very rewarding experience, not only because it helped me to discover more light and creativity but also because the pretty girl I asked to help me had to grab my hand to teach me the vibrato technique. I must have been a pretty good student, because later she became my wife. One just never knows what conduits are being opened when we try new things.

Sparked by curiosity, we discover new conduits for light as we invest time in learning new skills. Additionally, just as the beauty of the surrounding world is expressed through varying wavelengths of light, our lives are enriched when we seek out a balanced variety of knowledge.

Our use as instruments in the Lord’s hands depends on our ability to remain sharpened as we continually fill our lives with light, making this graduation the dawn of our future. The Lord has a work for us to do if we will extend our reach to it. Just as the sun’s light shoots across the vast distance of space and illuminates our planet, all truth shines forth from God, enlightening us as we seek for it. He has said:

&lt;i&gt;If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

He will help us in our quest for knowledge if we will—as we have done here at Brigham Young University—center our learning on Him.

While the sun may be setting on our time at BYU, it is only beginning to rise on our eternal development. This sunrise will ultimately give way to “the perfect day” if we continue to seek after light and truth.

Fellow graduates, congratulations—not only for what we are finishing but also for what we are all beginning.

			<p>Picture in your minds an image of the sun with its rays peeking over the mountains and the sky lit up like a fire. Few visions can surpass the beauty of this scene. In your mind’s eye, is this sun setting or rising?</p>
<p>Few moments in life are anticipated as much as graduation from college and the celebration of the hard work that was required. Few experiences can surpass the poignancy of this moment. Again, is your sun setting or rising? The difference between the two is important, since one gives way to darkness while the other leads to more light.</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants it is written:</p>
<p><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Truth is light. We need light in order to see, because it carries information from the world to our eyes.</p>
<p>If this time of commencement is to be the dawn of our future growth, we must seek out opportunities to expand our knowledge. As a famous phrase states, “Education is not so much the filling of a bucket as the lighting of a fire.”<sup>2</sup> Fire, as a source of light, needs constant fueling to burn. From our education here we have learned that the real key to learning is the maintenance of this fire—the thirst for more light.</p>
<p>Just as the light of day requires a window to pass into our homes, the light of truth requires a conduit to pass into our souls. We have discovered here at Brigham Young University that the sciences, humanities, and arts are some of the many conduits that invite truth into our lives, because all things testify of Christ.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Light and knowledge may be acquired in two different ways. One way is to receive light by having others refer us to that knowledge; the second is to seek out conduits for this light on our own. Our education here at Brigham Young University has trained us to employ both of these methods.</p>
<p>While studying here, we have relied heavily on enlightened professors who have encouraged us—by shining example—to “seek . . . out of the best books words of wisdom.”<sup>4</sup> As I have read great recommended works, such as Gogol’s <i>Dead Souls</i> or Dostoyevsky’s <i>Crime and Punishment,</i> the light of truth has reflected into my heart and expanded my soul.<sup>5</sup> My mind has been ignited to such a point that my wife and I have placed a quote from Erasmus on our bulletin board: “When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes.”<sup>6</sup> This is also a feeling that most of us starving graduates have experienced at the beginning of each semester.</p>
<p>As we have pored over textbooks and other materials, our minds have been enlightened and our lives have grown brighter and brighter. This change was barely noticeable at the time, as we learned “line upon line, precept upon precept”<sup>7</sup>—just as darkness steadily turns into day with the gradual rising of the sun. Looking back now, we can notice the change in light, but we have not yet grown unto “the perfect day.”</p>
<p>From here we will need to discover our own individual ways of obtaining light through the second method I mentioned: our own experiences. It is hoped that our experiences here have prepared us well for this. A few years ago I made a personal goal to learn how to play the violin. Initially it seemed that instead of light I had discovered the purest conduit of pain for my roommates and family as I practiced. However, eventually it was a very rewarding experience, not only because it helped me to discover more light and creativity but also because the pretty girl I asked to help me had to grab my hand to teach me the vibrato technique. I must have been a pretty good student, because later she became my wife. One just never knows what conduits are being opened when we try new things.</p>
<p>Sparked by curiosity, we discover new conduits for light as we invest time in learning new skills. Additionally, just as the beauty of the surrounding world is expressed through varying wavelengths of light, our lives are enriched when we seek out a balanced variety of knowledge.</p>
<p>Our use as instruments in the Lord’s hands depends on our ability to remain sharpened as we continually fill our lives with light, making this graduation the dawn of our future. The Lord has a work for us to do if we will extend our reach to it. Just as the sun’s light shoots across the vast distance of space and illuminates our planet, all truth shines forth from God, enlightening us as we seek for it. He has said:</p>
<p><i>If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>He will help us in our quest for knowledge if we will—as we have done here at Brigham Young University—center our learning on Him.</p>
<p>While the sun may be setting on our time at BYU, it is only beginning to rise on our eternal development. This sunrise will ultimately give way to “the perfect day” if we continue to seek after light and truth.</p>
<p>Fellow graduates, congratulations—not only for what we are finishing but also for what we are all beginning.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have long been fascinated by words and language. My children would call me a word nerd. I’m the kind of person who wonders why we drive on parkways and park on driveways. Think about it. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Similarly, have you ever wondered if a fly lost its wings, would we call it a walk? Again, you have to think about it—and now you know why my children groan a lot when I try to use my sense of humor.
My love of language is one reason why I enjoy graduation ceremonies so much. At graduation we hear words that we don’t ordinarily use in everyday life. We use terms like cum laude, with either summa or magna attached as modifiers; these are not terms typically bandied about during the family dinner hour.
Two of the terms we often hear at graduation are alma mater and alumni. In a few minutes Amy Fennegan will officially welcome you graduates as alumni of BYU, and upon graduation, BYU will become your alma mater. Again, these are not words that we use in many other settings.
Interestingly, at least to me, and instructively, neither of these terms originated in connection with graduation or even higher education. Alma mater is a two-word Latin term that literally translated means “bounteous [or] nourishing mother.”1 In its early form, “it was a title given by the Romans to several goddesses but in particular to Ceres and Cybele, both representing fostering mother figures.”2 The association with higher education came many centuries later when the University of Bologna—which many identify as the first university in the Western world—adopted as its motto Alma mater studiorum, meaning “nurturing mother of studies.”3 Since that time alma mater has been used in a variety of ways at universities. And the idea that universities play a special “nurturing” role in the development of their students—somewhat like though not identical to that of a parent—has taken hold in American society to the extent that the prevailing definition of alma mater now is the university or college from which one has graduated.4
The term alumni similarly developed outside of academia and likewise referred to a special, almost parent-like relationship. In Rome, alumni was first used as a term that generally referred to “children abandoned by their parents and brought up in the home of someone else”5—what we might now call foster children. Over time the term alumni came to also refer to students or pupils in an educational setting.
In this setting today it is worth noting that the two terms we hear often at graduation—alma mater and alumni—both originally referred to a special relationship, one very much like but also different from that between a parent and a child. M</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is wonderful to be here. This is not an opportunity I would have imagined for myself. It is truly a future only God could see for me. I am grateful for a Father in Heaven who knows me—who knows my potential and who wants me to become like Him. I can’t wait to someday see like He does—to know everything and to see the future and not just the past. But for now I will stand like a little girl on my Father’s feet, holding His hands and trusting Him as He guides me through the dance of this life. As His daughter, I hope someday to grow up to be just like Him. I am trying to become more like Him now by learning as much as I can and by working to refine the spiritual gifts He has given me.
Daughters of God
Revelation given in the book of Joel speaks of the role of women in the latter days when it says that, in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ,
I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, . . . 
 . . . and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. [Joel 2:28–29]
Your daughters shall prophesy! In these last days we are meant to seek and receive spiritual revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost. Like Rebekah, Hannah, Elisabeth, and Mary, women are meant to receive direct spiritual revelation through the gifts of the Spirit. Like Miriam (see Exodus 15:20), Deborah (see Judges 4:4), Huldah (see 2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22), and Anna (see Luke 2:36), we can develop the spiritual gift of prophecy and refine our ability to communicate with our Father in Heaven in ways that affect our own spiritual development and have a positive impact on the world around us.1
These spiritual gifts bring us closer to the image of God, in which we were created. Through her choice to partake of the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden, Mother Eve made it possible for each of us to exercise our agency in a world filled with choices, thereby providing a way for us to spiritually develop. I do not think it was an accident that by knowledge she opened a pathway that would allow us to become more like God. I believe this sets an eternal pattern. “The glory of God is intelligence” (D&amp;C 93:36), and we must likewise enhance our own inherent intelligence in order to become like Him and receive His ­spiritual gifts.
How do we reach this divine potential? How do we strength</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I count it a great blessing and a privilege to speak today at this university conference. I love to come to this campus.
Before I begin my formal remarks, I am going to tell you a little story about why I feel so strongly about this place. It is not only because as a student here for a year after my mission I found my professional calling to be a teacher and a scholar at the feet of truly, truly inspiring teachers like Larry T. Wimmer and others, but it is also because I met Sue here.
I want to tell you this little story about why I get a chill that just covers me when I walk on this campus. I had met Sue, and we were in the same family home evening group. We went for a walk one night, and I had the very distinct impression from the Spirit: “This is your ­eternal companion.” Fortunately, she had the same feeling.
Just a couple of days later I was walking along a diagonal sidewalk toward where in those days the sidewalks met in a big X, right about where the Harold B. Lee Library annex is now. I was walking along toward that X when the national anthem began playing, so I stopped. When it finished playing, I walked along the sidewalk and came to where the sidewalks crossed in an X. I ran into Sue right there in the middle of the X. It was on a Wednesday afternoon, and there were thousands of students in that area. And I ran into my eternal companion in the center of the X! I didn’t say this to the Lord, but I got it.
Just a few weeks ago we celebrated our forty-fifth anniversary. She is the love of my life. I came here to find her because she wasn’t in Boston. She was here. I am so grateful. And whenever I walk on this campus I feel the same way.
So I love to come here. And I love you. The Lord has blessed me with the gift of love for you. I believe He wants me in my responsibilities now to see you and love you the way He sees you and loves you.
I pray that you will feel that love today. I also pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us as we consider together the implications of a very simple message. This message has come to me personally, but I feel that I should share it with you.
The Need to Be Better
Here it is: Whatever level of spirituality we now enjoy in our lives; whatever degree of faith in Jesus Christ we now have; whatever strength of commitment and consecration; whatever degree of obedience, hope, or charity is ours; and whatever level of professional skill or ability we have obtained, it will not be sufficient for the work that lies ahead.
I believe this message fits into a beautiful pattern the Lord has established in the Restoration, beginning with His appearance with His Father to Joseph Smith in 1820. Line upon line, precept upon precept, and step by step, Jesus Christ has built up His Church and His people. He has said:
For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness.1
