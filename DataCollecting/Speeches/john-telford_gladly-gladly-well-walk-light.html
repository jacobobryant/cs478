  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is an honor to represent my colleagues in the Department of Visual Arts and to be invited to share a few thoughts about my discipline of photography with you today. During the first decade following the organization of the restored Church, the evolutionary steps leading to the invention of photography were taking place. To non-photographers it is probably just an interesting coincidence. But, as a photographer, I find it significant that photography, which literally means “drawing with light,” was invented about the same time as the light of the gospel was restored to the earth.

A photograph is created as light passes through a lens and forms an image on a substrate that is sensitized to light. The material records only the light, not the darkness. So-called photogenic drawings were miraculous to the various inventors in the first third of the nineteenth century. And they continue to mystify practitioners today.

The word &lt;i&gt;light&lt;/i&gt; is frequently used in conjunction with the gospel of Jesus Christ. We use the word in two principle ways: the light that illuminates and the light that enlightens and gives understanding. As one who teaches the art of drawing with light, I have frequently incorporated the scriptural aspects of light in my classes. I admonish my students to go to the Topical Guide and examine the scriptures that refer to light and then apply those scriptures to their lives and to their photography.

For example, the first few verses of Genesis record that God created light and divided it from darkness. While light was created on the first day, according to Genesis, it was not until the fourth day that God created the sun, moon, and stars (see Genesis 1:3–5, 16–19). It would leave one to wonder whether the light created on the first day was light that illuminates or light that enlightens.

Ecclesiastes 11:7 says, “Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.” As a photographer, I seek the sweet light—light that bathes my photographs with a warm glow and unusual brilliance.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus identified His disciples as “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14) and counseled them to “let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). My goal as a photographer has been to follow that counsel. Having produced hundreds of photographs that have been seen around the world in books, magazines, exhibitions, and on the Internet, I frequently ask myself: “Are my photographs a reflection of my testimony and are they being used to promote the values that I believe in? Am I using my talent as suggested in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants: ‘for the benefit of those who love [the Lord] and him that seeketh so to do’ (D&amp;amp;C 46:9)?”

I love the familiar lyrics of Clara W. McMaster’s “Teach Me to Walk in the Light”:

&lt;i&gt;Teach me to walk in the light of his love;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Teach me to pray to my Father above;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Teach me to know of the things that are right;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;Songbook,&lt;/i&gt; 177; also &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 304]

Each of the three verses ends with an admonition that seems to grow stronger in resolve and commitment. “Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.” And then, “Always, always to walk in the light.” And, finally, “Gladly, gladly we’ll walk in the light.”

Photography, like other contemporary media, has been used for both good and evil. Sadly, the evils of pornography that are frequently preached about by our Church leaders have their most common roots through the lens of a camera. The seductive influence of advertising that lures us toward evil habits frequently comes through the camera’s lens. Practices that we are counseled to avoid are often glorified by a camera. The evils of our day are portrayed as being good, exciting, and sought-after through the lens of a camera. Think about the number of times that sin is packaged or framed in beautiful and enticing photographic images.

And yet the scriptures focus on the correct picture. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon include these words of Isaiah: “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” (Isaiah 5:20, 2 Nephi 15:20). Isaiah’s words are easily understood in this scripture. Unfortunately, photography has frequently been used more like an eclipse than as a medium to exhibit the light.

Again I ask myself, “How do I know if I am being more like an eclipse or more like the light that glorifies?”

The Doctrine and Covenants teaches:

&lt;i&gt;That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]

It is an interesting question to ask about anything we do: “Does my work edify, and does it celebrate light, or does it promote and endorse darkness and evil?”

I like the counsel that Paul gave the Thessalonian Saints: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:5). As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the children of light! We have the light of Christ! Always, always, we’ll walk in the light.

A few years ago I had the assignment of supervising several students who were completing internships in New York City. Included among the interns were photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, and studio artists. They were working with some very prestigious individuals in their respective fields—individuals of considerable influence and notoriety. Part of my responsibility was to follow up with each of the internship providers and see how our BYU interns were performing. It is sometimes tempting for the interns to try to fit in and do the kind of work that is frequently seen in the world, and they are counseled to be true to their culture and upbringing and to “be just who you are and you’ll stand out and be noticed.”

As I contacted the various mentors, I received almost the same response: “They are so refreshing. They are so culturally solid. We love having these BYU interns. Send us more.” I recall one very important and highly respected photographer—one who we felt had given us a gift by accepting a BYU intern—thanking me for sending the intern and saying, “He is so non–New York. He is so refreshing. He has changed us.” He said it three times: “He has changed us.” He then added, “And we think we’ve changed him a little as well.”

National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones described the difference between being the best &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the world and being the best &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; the world. To be the best &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the world, all of the attention is focused on the individual. To be the best &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; the world, the attention is focused on others. (See &lt;i&gt;Celebrate What’s Right with the World,&lt;/i&gt; VHS and DVD [Saint Paul, Minnesota: Star Thrower Distribution, 2001].) These interns—and, hopefully, all of us—are preparing to be the best &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; the world. Always, always we’ll walk in the light.

I love to read the account of Moroni’s visit to the Prophet Joseph Smith on the night of September 21, 1823. In detail Joseph described the light that filled his room and surrounded the heavenly being. He described three visitations consuming the entire night. When each ended, the Prophet observed:

&lt;i&gt;The light in the room&lt;/i&gt; [began] &lt;i&gt;to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared.&lt;/i&gt; [JS—H 1:43]

The light that both illuminated and enlightened the young prophet is also the light that the angel ascended upon. It appears to me that in the presence of the angel Moroni—a resurrected being full of light—Joseph’s capacity for understanding and recall was greatly enhanced. He knew when the messenger was quoting scripture and when Moroni’s words varied a little from the way it reads in the Bible. It would seem to imply that Joseph knew word for word what had been told to him after hearing it three times that night and once again the next day. It would indicate, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, that “if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things” (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.

May I share with you some examples of the light that has illuminated some of my photographs?

While en route to an appointment with a very important photographer, I passed a stand of trees with morning light streaming through the fog and the trees. With a dutiful commitment to being on time for my appointment, I drove past the scene. The image of the trees and the light etched deeply in my mind as I drove until it hurt more to go past the trees than it did to think that I might be late for my appointment. “Go toward the light,” I heard myself saying. I turned the car around and went back, hoping that it had not changed and also hoping that the photographer with whom I had an appointment would understand the priority of the photograph.

Gratefully, I found the light unchanged and I made the photograph. Later, when I drove by the trees after my appointment, the fog was gone and the light had changed and the magic had disappeared. The beauty had been in the light.

A few hundred yards from Ansel Adams’ home in Yosemite Valley is a grouping of five trees. I took a workshop with Mr. Adams in 1974 and would get up each morning to go out and make photographs. Coming upon these trees in the pre-sunrise glow that illuminated them, I began to set up the large-format camera as quickly as I could. It is a cumbersome process that after years of experience I have been able to reduce to approximately five minutes. At that time, however, it took me from 10 to 20 minutes to set up and to make the tedious adjustments to the camera.

During the setup time, the sun came up. The trees were the same, but the light was different. The light had changed from soft brilliance to harsh contrast. The ethereal morning light had quickly changed, and I missed my opportunity. Without making an exposure I put everything away. The next morning I returned to the same spot 30 minutes earlier and again set up the camera. By the time light readings were taken and the exposure calculated, the sun had fully risen and I missed the shot again. The third morning I came even earlier. Again I set up the camera and calculated the exposure. This time I was able to make the photograph. It is a photograph that is still very important to me, one to which in hindsight I can apply President James E. Faust’s counsel: “If you can’t be on time, then be early.”

I have to admit that the style of my photographs is not readily accepted in contemporary art circles. The mainstream art community summarily rejects photographs that celebrate the beauty of the land as being overly romantic and derivative. In a recent exhibition of my landscape photographs I wrote the following artist statement:

&lt;i&gt;I recall a discussion in a seminar class during my graduate studies. In it the instructor quoted from an article that went something like this: “When everyone was ‘hot,’ I was ‘cool.’ When everyone was ‘cool,’ I was ‘hot.’” I feel my work—my career—is summed up in that quote. I have been doing “cool” color photographs for twenty years while black and white has been “hot.” I have been “out” doing pristine photographs of the landscape while contemporary photographs of dirt and grit and decay have been “in.” I have never been part of the current trend in photography, but I continue to produce the work that I am passionate about. My photographs are about beauty and the ephemeral things of the world. While I photograph the landscape that seems eternal and unchanging, I am more interested in the light and weather that is constantly changing and fleeting. I am interested in things that humans did not create and have no control over—things that humans stand in awe of in spite of the fact that they have been seen hundreds of times: the colors of autumn, the glow of the land under the ethereal light of sunrise, an emotion-filled sky before and after a storm.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In a world where we are preoccupied with challenging the intellect, I choose to nurture the soul. I choose to celebrate the positive things of our world.&lt;/i&gt;

Again, quoting from National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones: “Instead of complaining about what’s wrong with the situation, as we often do, ask what’s right with it. By celebrating what’s right, we find the energy to fix what’s wrong” (see &lt;i&gt;Celebrate What’s Right&lt;/i&gt;).

“I saw an angel in the stone,” said Michelangelo, “and carved to set it free” (see &lt;i&gt;Celebrate What’s Right&lt;/i&gt;).

Early in my tenure as a faculty member at BYU, I began photographing the historic buildings of the Church. These included the old tabernacles and meetinghouses found mostly in Utah and Idaho. When I am standing within the walls of these sanctuaries, I feel their pioneer builders’ spirit of testimony and commitment. Working almost exclusively with the native materials that were found near their homes, they transformed inhospitable environments into places of worship where the Light of Christ could be felt. Their devotion to their religion and to their God is seen in the craftsmanship exhibited in every detail of these buildings. The stained glass, the intricately carved woodwork, and the hand-painted pews, doors, columns, and railings all invite the Spirit.

One such example is seen in the Provo Tabernacle. On the rostrum, located behind the pulpit, is a detailed carving created by Thomas M. Allman that extends the entire width of the stand. In the center is a beautifully carved rendering of a sego lily. During the first winter following the arrival of the Mormon pioneers to these valleys, sego lilies growing wild on the hillsides of the Wasatch Mountains gave needed relief to the destitute and starving Saints. Like manna in the desert, sego lilies fed the children of God. Seen in the Provo Tabernacle behind the pulpit, behind the speaker, it is a reminder that a loving Father in Heaven feeds us both physically and spiritually.

In addition to the tabernacles and meetinghouses, I also began photographing our beautiful temples. Everything we do in the Church today eventually directs us toward the temple. Nothing we build—save possibly the family—is more important than our temples.

I have had the privilege of doing several books with my friend and colleague Dr. Susan Easton Black, noted professor of Church history and doctrine. In making the photographs for these books, I have been blessed with the opportunity of traveling to significant Church history sites like the following and seeing them in the most incredible light and ethereal conditions imaginable:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Smith family log home where Joseph was living at the time of the First Vision and also where the visitation of the angel Moroni occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Sacred Grove. (I have photographed trees all over the world, but none are more important to me than these trees.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The log home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., where the restored Church was organized on April 6, 1830.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The beautiful and significant valley of Adamondi-Ahman in Missouri.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Seventies Hall in Nauvoo, which was the original Missionary Training Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Joseph Smith’s Red Brick Store, where the Relief Society was organized in March 1842 and where the first presentation of the endowment in this dispensation was given in May of that same year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The newly rebuilt Nauvoo Temple seen from Parley Street—the view that Wilford Woodruff had when he wrote:&lt;i&gt;I was in Nauvoo on the 26th of May, 1846, for the last time, and left the city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewell of Nauvoo for this life. I looked back upon the Temple and City as they receded from view and asked the Lord to remember the sacrifices of His Saints.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Wilford Woodruff,&lt;/i&gt; ed. Matthias F. Cowley (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964), 248]

Also done with Susan Easton Black was a book on the Holy Land that included these photographs captioned with the scriptures:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shepherd’s Hill in Bethlehem: “For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Mount of Beatitudes: “And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: And he opened his mouth, and taught them” (Matthew 5:1–2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sunset on the Sea of Galilee: “When they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship” (John 6:19).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jerusalem, the Holy City: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, . . . how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood [but] ye would not!” (Luke 13:34).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thorn bush at sunrise: “And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head” (John 19:2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And, finally, the Garden Tomb: “Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him” (Mark 16:6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One of my journal entries from the Holy Land reads as follows:

&lt;i&gt;I find myself wondering, “Did I walk today where Jesus walked?” My intellect tells me no. But my heart and soul wants to believe that I did, and so wills it to my mind.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We came to Jerusalem, to Israel, hoping to draw closer to Jesus, wanting to walk the paths where Jesus had walked. Many times during our stay we lamented that we were not feeling of His presence. The schedule was too hectic or the noise or other distractions got in the way. While there were many times when we were touched emotionally and even spiritually, even to the point of tears, yet there was something more we wanted—something unfulfilled.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;While sitting on the Mount of Olives, and again while looking into the tomb in the peaceful garden, an answer came to me, similar to the one given to Mary when she came looking for Him: “He is not here,&lt;/i&gt; [He] &lt;i&gt;is risen” (Luke 24:6).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Simple, yet so profound. We find Him today where He promised we would. We find Him when we partake of the sacrament. We find Him when we are gathered together in His name. We find Him in His holy house. We find Him in keeping His commandments. I came to realize that the important question is not “Did I walk today where Jesus walked?” but rather “Am I walking today where Jesus would have me walk?”&lt;/i&gt;

I invite each of you to join with me in the resolve that “Gladly, gladly we’ll walk in the light.” In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

During the first decade following the organization of the restored Church, the evolutionary steps leading to the invention of photography were taking place. To non-photographers it is probably just an interesting coincidence. But, as a photographer, I find it significant that photography, which literally means “drawing with light,” was invented about the same time as the light of the gospel was restored to the earth.</p>
<p>A photograph is created as light passes through a lens and forms an image on a substrate that is sensitized to light. The material records only the light, not the darkness. So-called photogenic drawings were miraculous to the various inventors in the first third of the nineteenth century. And they continue to mystify practitioners today.</p>
<p>The word <i>light</i> is frequently used in conjunction with the gospel of Jesus Christ. We use the word in two principle ways: the light that illuminates and the light that enlightens and gives understanding. As one who teaches the art of drawing with light, I have frequently incorporated the scriptural aspects of light in my classes. I admonish my students to go to the Topical Guide and examine the scriptures that refer to light and then apply those scriptures to their lives and to their photography.</p>
<p>For example, the first few verses of Genesis record that God created light and divided it from darkness. While light was created on the first day, according to Genesis, it was not until the fourth day that God created the sun, moon, and stars (see Genesis 1:3–5, 16–19). It would leave one to wonder whether the light created on the first day was light that illuminates or light that enlightens.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes 11:7 says, “Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.” As a photographer, I seek the sweet light—light that bathes my photographs with a warm glow and unusual brilliance.</p>
<p>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus identified His disciples as “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14) and counseled them to “let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). My goal as a photographer has been to follow that counsel. Having produced hundreds of photographs that have been seen around the world in books, magazines, exhibitions, and on the Internet, I frequently ask myself: “Are my photographs a reflection of my testimony and are they being used to promote the values that I believe in? Am I using my talent as suggested in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants: ‘for the benefit of those who love [the Lord] and him that seeketh so to do’ (D&amp;C 46:9)?”</p>
<p>I love the familiar lyrics of Clara W. McMaster’s “Teach Me to Walk in the Light”:</p>
<p><i>Teach me to walk in the light of his love;</i></p>
<p><i>Teach me to pray to my Father above;</i></p>
<p><i>Teach me to know of the things that are right;</i></p>
<p><i>Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.</i></p>
<p>[<i>Songbook,</i> 177; also <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 304]</p>
<p>Each of the three verses ends with an admonition that seems to grow stronger in resolve and commitment. “Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.” And then, “Always, always to walk in the light.” And, finally, “Gladly, gladly we’ll walk in the light.”</p>
<p>Photography, like other contemporary media, has been used for both good and evil. Sadly, the evils of pornography that are frequently preached about by our Church leaders have their most common roots through the lens of a camera. The seductive influence of advertising that lures us toward evil habits frequently comes through the camera’s lens. Practices that we are counseled to avoid are often glorified by a camera. The evils of our day are portrayed as being good, exciting, and sought-after through the lens of a camera. Think about the number of times that sin is packaged or framed in beautiful and enticing photographic images.</p>
<p>And yet the scriptures focus on the correct picture. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon include these words of Isaiah: “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” (Isaiah 5:20, 2 Nephi 15:20). Isaiah’s words are easily understood in this scripture. Unfortunately, photography has frequently been used more like an eclipse than as a medium to exhibit the light.</p>
<p>Again I ask myself, “How do I know if I am being more like an eclipse or more like the light that glorifies?”</p>
<p>The Doctrine and Covenants teaches:</p>
<p><i>That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i></p>
<p><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i> [D&amp;C 50:23–24]</p>
<p>It is an interesting question to ask about anything we do: “Does my work edify, and does it celebrate light, or does it promote and endorse darkness and evil?”</p>
<p>I like the counsel that Paul gave the Thessalonian Saints: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:5). As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we <i>are</i> the children of light! We have the light of Christ! Always, always, we’ll walk in the light.</p>
<p>A few years ago I had the assignment of supervising several students who were completing internships in New York City. Included among the interns were photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, and studio artists. They were working with some very prestigious individuals in their respective fields—individuals of considerable influence and notoriety. Part of my responsibility was to follow up with each of the internship providers and see how our BYU interns were performing. It is sometimes tempting for the interns to try to fit in and do the kind of work that is frequently seen in the world, and they are counseled to be true to their culture and upbringing and to “be just who you are and you’ll stand out and be noticed.”</p>
<p>As I contacted the various mentors, I received almost the same response: “They are so refreshing. They are so culturally solid. We love having these BYU interns. Send us more.” I recall one very important and highly respected photographer—one who we felt had given us a gift by accepting a BYU intern—thanking me for sending the intern and saying, “He is so non–New York. He is so refreshing. He has changed us.” He said it three times: “He has changed us.” He then added, “And we think we’ve changed him a little as well.”</p>
<p>National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones described the difference between being the best <i>in</i> the world and being the best <i>for</i> the world. To be the best <i>in</i> the world, all of the attention is focused on the individual. To be the best <i>for</i> the world, the attention is focused on others. (See <i>Celebrate What’s Right with the World,</i> VHS and DVD [Saint Paul, Minnesota: Star Thrower Distribution, 2001].) These interns—and, hopefully, all of us—are preparing to be the best <i>for</i> the world. Always, always we’ll walk in the light.</p>
<p>I love to read the account of Moroni’s visit to the Prophet Joseph Smith on the night of September 21, 1823. In detail Joseph described the light that filled his room and surrounded the heavenly being. He described three visitations consuming the entire night. When each ended, the Prophet observed:</p>
<p><i>The light in the room</i> [began] <i>to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared.</i> [JS—H 1:43]</p>
<p>The light that both illuminated and enlightened the young prophet is also the light that the angel ascended upon. It appears to me that in the presence of the angel Moroni—a resurrected being full of light—Joseph’s capacity for understanding and recall was greatly enhanced. He knew when the messenger was quoting scripture and when Moroni’s words varied a little from the way it reads in the Bible. It would seem to imply that Joseph knew word for word what had been told to him after hearing it three times that night and once again the next day. It would indicate, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, that “if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things” (D&amp;C 88:67). Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.</p>
<p>May I share with you some examples of the light that has illuminated some of my photographs?</p>
<p>While en route to an appointment with a very important photographer, I passed a stand of trees with morning light streaming through the fog and the trees. With a dutiful commitment to being on time for my appointment, I drove past the scene. The image of the trees and the light etched deeply in my mind as I drove until it hurt more to go past the trees than it did to think that I might be late for my appointment. “Go toward the light,” I heard myself saying. I turned the car around and went back, hoping that it had not changed and also hoping that the photographer with whom I had an appointment would understand the priority of the photograph.</p>
<p>Gratefully, I found the light unchanged and I made the photograph. Later, when I drove by the trees after my appointment, the fog was gone and the light had changed and the magic had disappeared. The beauty had been in the light.</p>
<p>A few hundred yards from Ansel Adams’ home in Yosemite Valley is a grouping of five trees. I took a workshop with Mr. Adams in 1974 and would get up each morning to go out and make photographs. Coming upon these trees in the pre-sunrise glow that illuminated them, I began to set up the large-format camera as quickly as I could. It is a cumbersome process that after years of experience I have been able to reduce to approximately five minutes. At that time, however, it took me from 10 to 20 minutes to set up and to make the tedious adjustments to the camera.</p>
<p>During the setup time, the sun came up. The trees were the same, but the light was different. The light had changed from soft brilliance to harsh contrast. The ethereal morning light had quickly changed, and I missed my opportunity. Without making an exposure I put everything away. The next morning I returned to the same spot 30 minutes earlier and again set up the camera. By the time light readings were taken and the exposure calculated, the sun had fully risen and I missed the shot again. The third morning I came even earlier. Again I set up the camera and calculated the exposure. This time I was able to make the photograph. It is a photograph that is still very important to me, one to which in hindsight I can apply President James E. Faust’s counsel: “If you can’t be on time, then be early.”</p>
<p>I have to admit that the style of my photographs is not readily accepted in contemporary art circles. The mainstream art community summarily rejects photographs that celebrate the beauty of the land as being overly romantic and derivative. In a recent exhibition of my landscape photographs I wrote the following artist statement:</p>
<p><i>I recall a discussion in a seminar class during my graduate studies. In it the instructor quoted from an article that went something like this: “When everyone was ‘hot,’ I was ‘cool.’ When everyone was ‘cool,’ I was ‘hot.’” I feel my work—my career—is summed up in that quote. I have been doing “cool” color photographs for twenty years while black and white has been “hot.” I have been “out” doing pristine photographs of the landscape while contemporary photographs of dirt and grit and decay have been “in.” I have never been part of the current trend in photography, but I continue to produce the work that I am passionate about. My photographs are about beauty and the ephemeral things of the world. While I photograph the landscape that seems eternal and unchanging, I am more interested in the light and weather that is constantly changing and fleeting. I am interested in things that humans did not create and have no control over—things that humans stand in awe of in spite of the fact that they have been seen hundreds of times: the colors of autumn, the glow of the land under the ethereal light of sunrise, an emotion-filled sky before and after a storm.</i></p>
<p><i>In a world where we are preoccupied with challenging the intellect, I choose to nurture the soul. I choose to celebrate the positive things of our world.</i></p>
<p>Again, quoting from National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones: “Instead of complaining about what’s wrong with the situation, as we often do, ask what’s right with it. By celebrating what’s right, we find the energy to fix what’s wrong” (see <i>Celebrate What’s Right</i>).</p>
<p>“I saw an angel in the stone,” said Michelangelo, “and carved to set it free” (see <i>Celebrate What’s Right</i>).</p>
<p>Early in my tenure as a faculty member at BYU, I began photographing the historic buildings of the Church. These included the old tabernacles and meetinghouses found mostly in Utah and Idaho. When I am standing within the walls of these sanctuaries, I feel their pioneer builders’ spirit of testimony and commitment. Working almost exclusively with the native materials that were found near their homes, they transformed inhospitable environments into places of worship where the Light of Christ could be felt. Their devotion to their religion and to their God is seen in the craftsmanship exhibited in every detail of these buildings. The stained glass, the intricately carved woodwork, and the hand-painted pews, doors, columns, and railings all invite the Spirit.</p>
<p>One such example is seen in the Provo Tabernacle. On the rostrum, located behind the pulpit, is a detailed carving created by Thomas M. Allman that extends the entire width of the stand. In the center is a beautifully carved rendering of a sego lily. During the first winter following the arrival of the Mormon pioneers to these valleys, sego lilies growing wild on the hillsides of the Wasatch Mountains gave needed relief to the destitute and starving Saints. Like manna in the desert, sego lilies fed the children of God. Seen in the Provo Tabernacle behind the pulpit, behind the speaker, it is a reminder that a loving Father in Heaven feeds us both physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>In addition to the tabernacles and meetinghouses, I also began photographing our beautiful temples. Everything we do in the Church today eventually directs us toward the temple. Nothing we build—save possibly the family—is more important than our temples.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege of doing several books with my friend and colleague Dr. Susan Easton Black, noted professor of Church history and doctrine. In making the photographs for these books, I have been blessed with the opportunity of traveling to significant Church history sites like the following and seeing them in the most incredible light and ethereal conditions imaginable:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Smith family log home where Joseph was living at the time of the First Vision and also where the visitation of the angel Moroni occurred.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Sacred Grove. (I have photographed trees all over the world, but none are more important to me than these trees.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The log home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., where the restored Church was organized on April 6, 1830.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The beautiful and significant valley of Adamondi-Ahman in Missouri.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Seventies Hall in Nauvoo, which was the original Missionary Training Center.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Smith’s Red Brick Store, where the Relief Society was organized in March 1842 and where the first presentation of the endowment in this dispensation was given in May of that same year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The newly rebuilt Nauvoo Temple seen from Parley Street—the view that Wilford Woodruff had when he wrote:<i>I was in Nauvoo on the 26th of May, 1846, for the last time, and left the city of the Saints feeling that most likely I was taking a final farewell of Nauvoo for this life. I looked back upon the Temple and City as they receded from view and asked the Lord to remember the sacrifices of His Saints.</i> [<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i> ed. Matthias F. Cowley (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964), 248]
<p>Also done with Susan Easton Black was a book on the Holy Land that included these photographs captioned with the scriptures:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shepherd’s Hill in Bethlehem: “For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Mount of Beatitudes: “And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: And he opened his mouth, and taught them” (Matthew 5:1–2).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sunset on the Sea of Galilee: “When they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship” (John 6:19).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jerusalem, the Holy City: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, . . . how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood [but] ye would not!” (Luke 13:34).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thorn bush at sunrise: “And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head” (John 19:2).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And, finally, the Garden Tomb: “Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him” (Mark 16:6).</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my journal entries from the Holy Land reads as follows:</p>
<p><i>I find myself wondering, “Did I walk today where Jesus walked?” My intellect tells me no. But my heart and soul wants to believe that I did, and so wills it to my mind.</i></p>
<p><i>We came to Jerusalem, to Israel, hoping to draw closer to Jesus, wanting to walk the paths where Jesus had walked. Many times during our stay we lamented that we were not feeling of His presence. The schedule was too hectic or the noise or other distractions got in the way. While there were many times when we were touched emotionally and even spiritually, even to the point of tears, yet there was something more we wanted—something unfulfilled.</i></p>
<p><i>While sitting on the Mount of Olives, and again while looking into the tomb in the peaceful garden, an answer came to me, similar to the one given to Mary when she came looking for Him: “He is not here,</i> [He] <i>is risen” (Luke 24:6).</i></p>
<p><i>Simple, yet so profound. We find Him today where He promised we would. We find Him when we partake of the sacrament. We find Him when we are gathered together in His name. We find Him in His holy house. We find Him in keeping His commandments. I came to realize that the important question is not “Did I walk today where Jesus walked?” but rather “Am I walking today where Jesus would have me walk?”</i></p>
<p>I invite each of you to join with me in the resolve that “Gladly, gladly we’ll walk in the light.” In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What an amazing opportunity it is to stand before you today. Never in a million years would I have ever thought that I would be right here, right now. I must admit that the first thing I thought when asked if I would be willing to speak was, “Really? Are you sure? I’m just a soccer coach!” And then I thought, “Oh, no—those new Marriott Center screens are way too big!”
It goes to show you that we never know what God has in store for us in the present or in the future. Life is a journey, and we must always embrace it—even when we are asked to do something that we thought was absolutely unimaginable. My journey truly has been different than what I would have ever foreseen when I once sat in your seat over thirty years ago. But what a blessed life and what a ride it has been.
I pray that I will be able to share a few thoughts and stories today that might inspire you to realize your significance and importance here on earth. I know that I will not necessarily tell you anything you haven’t heard before, but I hope that I might remind you of what you have always known and of what can so easily be forgotten in our demanding lives.
Follow the Light
Does your life seem too busy at times? I know mine does. We live in a world in which our lives are busier, noisier, and more stressful than ever—a time when nothing stops or even slows down. We have more responsibilities, more pressures, more expectations, and more places to be, and we spend far too much time on our smartphones. It just seems impossible sometimes to keep up with the pace.
In order to slow down the madness of life, I love to retreat into nature. We are so blessed to live at the base of majestic mountains. We can look to the west and appreciate the view of the lake, travel east and be enveloped in the canyons, or drive south and take in the magnificence and serenity of the red rock.
I am always drawn to the light in the beauty of God’s creations, in which I can find ­calmness, comfort, peace, and a deeper connection to my Heavenly Father and my Savior. Just as the sun, the moon, and the stars light the landscape of this beautiful world, the light from above provides us with direction and purpose. When I think about light and the many different meanings it has, I reflect on an experience I had last June.
For several years I have had the opportunity to participate in a team race that takes runners through some of the most beautiful scenery in the state. The event starts in Logan and winds through the Wasatch Back to finish in Park City. It is called the Ragnar Relay Series, and each team consists of two vans, with six people packed into each van. Each team spends more than thirty hours together with no sleep, not much food, and few rest spots. Each team member runs three different routes, and the whole team runs a total of more than 180 miles. What an adventure!
Last year I wasn’t quite as prepared as usual</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Shortly after accepting my job at BYU, I called Elder Jeffrey R. Holland’s office to ask if he would do the voice-over for an athletics commercial during the height of Jimmermania. Because of my football career I had gotten to know Elder Holland, and I thought he would be the perfect person, with his distinctive voice, for the job.
Then I had a meeting with Tom Holmoe, BYU’s athletic director, and I let him know how excited I was about the possibility of including Elder Holland in our project. I naïvely assumed that Tom would be thrilled about my phone call and invitation.
I was wrong. It was a major faux pas. He let me know that any invitation to one of the leaders of the Church needed to go through the president of the school. I quickly wrote an apology to President Samuelson, and this was his inspiring reply:
Chad,
No need to worry. We sometimes forget to inform those coming into BYU employment of the unique way things are done at BYU, particularly when it relates to contacts and requests of the senior Brethren. You are like those guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom because no one ever taught them the gospel. We probably should not take this one up the line, but feel free to raise any good ideas you have. Sorry we didn’t loop you in earlier. I know Elder Holland’s only concern would be disappointing you. Know that you are loved and appreciated. All the best.
Cec
I love that letter. It is a shining example of my topic today: “The World Needs to See and Feel Your Light.” What does President Samuelson’s letter, with his good-natured correction for me, have to do with this theme? Everything! How do you think it made me feel as a new BYU employee to receive that letter? It inspired me. He didn’t crush me with his authority; it was just the opposite. I could feel his light and the love he had for me.
As I share my thoughts with you today, I hope to better prepare you for tomorrow. Many of you will run your own companies. You may hold positions of leadership. You would be wise to follow President Samuelson’s great example of how to correct and inspire others.
President Samuelson has tried to respond to every email from every student. Think of the encouragement and faith that he has shared with you and other students over the last eleven years. He has certainly followed the counsel of the Savior to let his light shine. He and Sister Samuelson are awesome, and I will miss my association with them. President Kevin Worthen and his wife, Peggy, will likewise win your hearts and earn your respect as they serve you. I know President Worthen and have complete confidence in him.
Our Savior Jesus Christ said, “Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven” (3 Nephi 12:16). That is my favorite scripture. Let your light shine.
When President Thomas S.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">An important problem that arises in many settings is the Traveling Salesman Problem.
A traveler must visit many destinations to sell her goods or make her deliveries. Her problem is this: what route will be the fastest way to get to all the destinations? A poor choice could mean she travels many times farther than she would if she made a good choice.
Obviously this problem is important to companies like UPS, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart, and Amazon. For example, according to Wired magazine, UPS has roughly 55,000 delivery trucks running each day. If each driver could choose a route that shaves just one mile off the daily trip, that would save the company $30 million each year.1
And this problem is not only interesting to companies involved in delivery. The Traveling Salesman Problem also has applications in computer chip manufacturing, DNA sequencing, and many other areas.
Consider the situation for three destinations—call them A, B, and C. One of the possible routes our traveler could take to these three destinations would be to first go to city C, then to city B, then to city A, and then home again.
Altogether there are six possible routes in this situation, so to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem with three destinations, I need only compare the six routes and see which is shortest.
With four destinations I must check a bit more: twenty-four possible routes. I can do that. With five destinations we have 120 routes. I am too lazy to check all those, but it is not hard to write some computer code to do it for me. You may have noticed that the number of routes to check is growing rapidly. For ten destinations we have 3,628,800 possible routes to check—a lot, but not impossible.
For twenty destinations it grows to 2,432,902,008,176,640,000. This is a little too big for my laptop to check in any reasonable amount of time. In fact, if my computer could check a billion routes per second, it would still take seventy-seven years to check all the possible routes. At current energy prices, just the electricity for the computation would cost roughly $675,000.
Now let me reassure you. It may look like I am going all mathy on you, but don’t worry—I won’t make you compute anything, you don’t need to remember any of these numbers, and there won’t be a quiz at the end. So stay with me for just a bit longer.
The point is, even for just twenty destinations we have way too many possible routes to check in any reasonable amount of time. The bad news is that in many real-life situations we have a lot more destinations than just twenty—for example, a UPS driver makes an average of 120 deliveries each day.
For 120 deliveries there are so many possible routes we couldn’t store them all in the memory of any computer in existence, not even if our computer’s memory comprised all the atoms in the universe—or even all the atoms in a googol2 u</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a glorious sight you are! It’s an honor, my young friends, to be here with you. I feel the tremendous weight of the responsibility which is mine to provide you with a message which will hopefully be helpful to you not only for today but, indeed, throughout your lives.
As I gaze at this vast audience, I’m reminded that each of you is one of a kind. Each has had experiences unique to you and you alone. You have come to Brigham Young University from locations across the country and the world. You come from varied backgrounds. And yet there is much that we have in common one with another. We know where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we leave this life. We know that we are children of our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. We know we want to return to Him after we leave this earthly existence. We know that what we do—and don’t do—here in mortality is of utmost importance. We also know that, should we fall short, our Savior has provided us with the precious gift of the Atonement and that, if we change our lives and our hearts and take advantage of the power of the Atonement, our sins and shortcomings will be forgiven and forgotten.
We have in common the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we know it is our responsibility to share the truths of the gospel with others. One of the chief ways in which we can share the gospel is to be a righteous example, and it is about this that I wish to speak to you today. The Apostle Paul admonished, “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”1 He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be “as lights in the world.”2
This is what I would hope for each of us—that we might be a light to the world.
What is light? Webster’s dictionary lists no less than fifteen definitions for the noun light. I prefer the simple “something that illuminates.” Just as turning on a light switch in a dark room will bathe the room in light, so providing an example of righteousness—and therefore being a light—can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.
Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. Said President Harold B. Lee:
Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God—that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed. Moroni spoke of [that light,] that Spirit when he said:
“For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know</span>
