  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="What a delight to be here. I have a very fond place in my heart for this wonderful institution and for all of the great work that is accomplished here. Thank you for joining me this morning. I would like to recognize my wife, Jennifer, with me here on the stand. She is my angel. I am also delighted to have my parents and children here.

On February 17, 2002, nervous anticipation filled the Salt Lake Ice Center for Apolo Ono’s first Olympic short-track, speed-skating final, the 1,000 meters. Apolo was heralded as an Olympian who had a chance to win four gold medals. He typically waits until late in the race to make his move, and this race was no different. With two laps remaining, he finally moved to the front of the pack of five skaters. On the very last corner, Apolo and Li Jiajun from China bumped lightly, then Li bumped Ahn Hyun-soo from Korea, and in an instant they found themselves spilled across the ice, sliding into the padded walls. Only the Australian, Steven Bradbury, remained upright to cross the finish line, the first Australian ever to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics. As he would later say, his strategy worked perfectly—he hoped the others would crash.

As Steven was crossing the finish line, the crowd breathed a collective groan, their hopes of an American gold medal fallen with Apolo, who was also injured in the crash with a gash that would require six stitches. Largely unnoticed in the instantaneous aftermath of the fallen skaters, Apolo scrambled to get up and slide, skate first, across the finish line. He knew that winning the silver medal was still possible and that what would determine his order of finish would be when his skate crossed the line. He barely edged out the Canadian for the silver medal. During the medal ceremony Apolo exuded how thrilled he was. He didn’t lose the gold. He won the silver. When Apolo fell, he not only got up, he got up quickly.

I would like to touch on a few lessons for life that we can learn—each illuminated from events in the Olympics. One of life’s experiences is that we all get knocked down. As in Apolo’s case, we are never sure what is around the next corner. In our case, we may not get knocked down on ice, but we can experience reversals in health, finances, or with family, friends, or other areas. Our challenge is what happens next. We need to get up and get up quickly. In our theme song for the Games, “Light the Fire Within,” sung by LeAnn Rimes, we find the following:

&lt;i&gt;And if we fall,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We won’t stay down.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We will get back up&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And use the strength we’ve found—&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And we will rise&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Like champions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Every obstacle we’ll overcome.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Once in every lifetime&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There’s a chance to stand apart.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We can show the world&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Our very best,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Reveal what’s in our hearts.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And so the story goes and glory&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Never will end.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Inspiration lights&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The fire within.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Light the Fire Within,” by David Foster and Linda Thompson]

Everyone faces challenges we never thought would come our way. The key question we face as a result of these reversals or trials is whether it will bring us closer to God. I believe we face this basic choice every time we encounter these difficulties: Will it push us farther away from God or bring us closer to Him? We should see more clearly our complete dependency upon God and humble ourselves in our relationship with Him.

The people of Alma provide an inspiring example and enlightenment on the trying times we encounter. In Mosiah 24:15 we read: “The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.” I believe one of the great purposes of the burdens we face is to recognize our dependence upon the Lord and to submit our will to His. Indeed, the Savior is our schoolmaster in this principle. In 3 Nephi 27:13 the Savior said, “I came into the world to do the will of my Father.” Is that not also true of us? Are we here to do the will of our Father? When we encounter such trials in our lives and at times feel helpless on our own to resolve them, we can turn to our Father for that source of divine assistance and in turn more closely mesh our will with His.

A second lesson was embodied in the experience of Jimmy Shea, Jr. Several years ago we asked the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, to add the skeleton back to the Winter Olympic program, particularly in light of the fact that, at the time, Jimmy Shea was one of the best in the world. We wanted the U.S. to do well in these Games. The skeleton is a sport in which competitors lie on a sled face first and fly down a bobsled track at 80 miles per hour.

Jimmy dreamed of becoming part of the first three-generation Olympic family in history, with both his father and grandfather having competed in the Olympics. We invited them to participate in the opening ceremonies, but then we were all struck by the tragic death of his 91-year-old grandfather last December when his car was hit by a drunk driver.

The day of the skeleton competition began with a light snow falling. Expectations were not high for Jimmy Shea, since for the past season his performance had not been up to what it had been previously. He had also been recovering from invasive surgery to his leg. However, after the end of the first of two runs, everyone was astonished to see him in first place. Because the athletes compete in reverse order of the standings, in the second run Jimmy would be last. The snow continued to fall, potentially making the track slower, even though we briefly cleaned it between each competitor. Jimmy began with a lead of five one-hundredths of a second, and as he moved through the turns, his lead became less and less. As he passed through the final time interval before the end, he was actually behind by one one-hundredth of a second. Experts in the sport tell you that it is impossible to make up time at the very end of the track. But when Jimmy Shea finished the last three turns, he ended up winning the gold by five one-hundredths of a second. We had witnessed a very magical, emotional moment, especially when he took a picture of his recently deceased grandfather out of his helmet. When asked how many Sheas were on the sled, Jimmy answered, “Two.” His father suggested that Grandfather Shea gave him a little extra push. It was like Jimmy had a divine hand pushing him down that last part of the track.

During the Games I am certain we had a divine hand with us. There were many instances when we received assistance beyond our capabilities. There was one area in particular that would dramatically affect the outcome of the Games—the weather. Wind and snow are very problematic—though you wouldn’t think so for the Winter Games. For example, we turned the downhill run into a sheet of ice. We used a water bar to inject water every eight inches into the entire slope and then let it freeze. The competitors’ skis bite more effectively and consistently into an icy surface. Imagine flying down a sheet of ice at 80 miles per hour. When it snows, it ruins the prepared surface, and we start over with 27 Sno-Cats and 1,600 volunteers just for the downhill runs.

We enjoyed miraculously superb weather during the Games, beginning with a storm the morning of the opening ceremonies to blow out the inversion and to put a blanket of white on the mountains. During the 17 days of the event we showcased the majestic, white mountains and deep blue skies of Utah. We could not have scripted better weather. It made a fundamental difference to the outcome of our Games.

As the closing ceremonies approached, I kept an eye on an approaching storm that was forecast to hit that evening. Late in the afternoon of the closing ceremonies I was in the stadium monitoring the load-in when the storm hit with large black clouds and then rain. It cleared out before the start of the ceremonies, but the forecast called for a major windstorm to come through between 7:30 and 9 p.m., right in the heart of our program. Winds would be a problem. They would hinder the dinosaurs, prevent the large balloons from being used, and, worst of all, cancel the fireworks—more than 36,000 shells.

I stayed in touch by cell phone with our weather center, which was tied into ground-monitoring stations for hundreds of miles. Each successive report updated the storm approaching Salt Lake from the west. Then, at 7:30, I received a call that went something like this: “The strangest thing has happened. A wind has come in from the east, which almost never happens. It has stalled the wind front over the Great Salt Lake, so you are good to go for the entire show.”

A feeling similar to electricity coursed through me. The closing ceremonies came off perfectly, and just 15 minutes after the stadium emptied, the storm hit with ferocity, tearing to shreds left-behind ponchos and programs. Mitt Romney and I watched this and commented that this was like a divine punctuation mark of who is really in charge. In our minds the weather was divinely provided.

We know we had a divine hand with us. We all have a divine hand in our lives. Our Father in Heaven and His Son care deeply for each of us. We need to recognize that They are ever present beside us to guide us along the way if we will but reach out to take the hand that is offered. It is real. It is a marvelous comfort. It is ever present, as we are worthy. It can keep us focused on our true mission in life as we take that divine hand and let it remind us and guide us in what we do. Remember that it is there.

One of the Olympic firsts for our Games was to choose a theme and amplify it through everything we did. Our theme was “Light the Fire Within,” suggesting to us all to strive harder, to reach higher to accomplish things we never thought possible. It also tied to the idea of inspiring others with that light kindled within each of us. You probably recall seeing the children of light throughout our ceremonies and at the Medals Plaza. The athletes certainly exemplify the theme of “Light the Fire Within” and the inspiration of achievement. There are dozens of stories, but one in particular is very poignant.

Eighteen months before the Games, Chris Klug lay on an operating table wondering if he would live. In 1998 he competed in Nagano in the men’s snowboard parallel giant slalom, finishing just out of the medals. His resolve was to compete in his home country, the United States. But in the summer of 2000 he was diagnosed with a life-threatening liver disease—the same disease that had taken the life of Walter Payton. Chris was wasting away, losing 30 pounds awaiting a liver transplant—a highly risky procedure, but his only hope to live. His operation was successful. He went into a special but very difficult training regimen, hoping to once again compete. At the Games he unexpectedly made it into the final round, and then—unbelievably—he won the bronze medal. He is the only organ transplant recipient ever to do so, and he won the medal on National Organ Transplant Awareness Day.

Chris was another example of “Light the Fire Within.” He had been knocked down but got back up and reached heights as yet unconquered. Focus and determination resulted in what almost all thought impossible. Each of us can strive to reach heights that may not seem possible today. Life is full of many twists and turns, and it is so exciting to contemplate what lies ahead of you. As you reach to light the fire within you, you become an inspiration to those around you. What you reach for may be in studies, career, or service to others. But it may also be to light the divine fire within yourself. Each of us has the seeds of divinity within us, lying dormant until we consciously plant them and nourish them to grow. Many times the goal may seem infinitely distant and the journey uncertain and challenging, but making that journey is what allows us to accomplish what we never thought possible and imparts some of life’s great lessons. So let each of us look inside ourselves to see how we may light that fire within and achieve more than we may think possible.

Certainly that was the case with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. I recall looking from the outside at the organization as the bribery scandal unfolded. I thought, “What a tragedy for our community, especially since we try to be the most honest of people.” Yet here were some of the headlines from around the world: “Biggest Scandal to Ever Hit the Olympics,” “Oly Scandal Leads to Resignation,” “Olympic Shame.” When I traveled across the U.S. or abroad during those times and mentioned that I was from Utah, I was met with comments about bribery and dishonesty. The thought of having great Olympic Games seemed an improbable dream.

Yet the people of Utah did have a dream to host the world. As the new management of SLOC, our objective was to do it in such a way that the past would fade away and be replaced with memories of magical Games. We had been knocked down, but it was time to get up and do what many thought impossible: put on great Games.

The Games were indeed magical. The headlines read: “The Little City That Could Did,” “2002 Olympics Light the Fire Within,” “Basking in Olympic Spirit,” and “Unbelievable Games.” Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said, “The Salt Lake Games are far and away the most successful Olympics, summer or winter, in history.” Jean Claude Killy said, “Salt Lake, we will always remember you. These were perfect Games.”

Our collective success had many sources. We had a great team, led by my partner Mitt Romney. We had superb organization. We had a divine hand of assistance. But one key factor noted throughout the world were the wonderful volunteers. President Jacques Rogge said to the world in the closing ceremonies, “Volunteers, you are, with the athletes, the champions of these Games. Your generosity and profound kindness has won our hearts. You were marvelous.” President Gordon B. Hinckley said in general conference last April, “I compliment and thank our people who participated in such numbers and so generously . . . to make of this a wonderful and most significant event” (“The Church Goes Forward,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2002, 6). So I am here to thank the wonderful volunteers from the community and BYU. Thank you, BYU, for lending us thousands of your superb students and for the wonderful job they did in hosting the world.

I would like to tell you a key statistic regarding these volunteers. In every Games previous to ours, the attrition rate of volunteers was 15 to 20 percent. In our Games we had attrition of less than 1 percent—an Olympic record.

As a thank-you for BYU’s partnership in hosting these Games, allow me to present you with an Olympic torch. President Bateman, you will note that the inscription on the torch reads, “Light the Fire Within,” something exemplified by your fine students.

Last summer, in commemorating the pioneers, President Hinckley quoted Brigham Young, who said, “Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here” (in &lt;i&gt;Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1900; New York: AMS Press, 1971], 122; cited by Preston Nibley in &lt;i&gt;Brigham Young: The Man and His Work&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936], 128). During the Games we had more than 140 dignitaries from around the world, in addition to our own president, vice president, and most of the cabinet. After the conclusion of the Games, President Hinckley said in April conference that “we have witnessed the fulfillment of that prophecy in these recent days” (“The Church Goes Forward,” 6). He also said, “But out of all of this came something wonderful for this Church. Representatives of the media, so often a tough and calloused group, with very few exceptions spoke and wrote in language both complimentary and accurately descriptive of a unique culture they found here . . . , of the spirit of hospitality which they felt” (“The Church Goes Forward,” 5).

Now when I travel around the world and mention that I am from Salt Lake City, a smile comes to the eyes, followed by a warm handshake thanking us for marvelous Games. These Games were important for our community and for the Church. Many around the world did not even know of us, but now they do. And their reactions are almost universally positive and warm. Salt Lake City is now an Olympic city, and one with the magical Games.

As we continue our journey in life, let us follow some of these simple lessons. We will get knocked down—and many times unexpectedly—but when we do, let’s get up, and let’s get up quickly. Let’s rely on the Lord and use the opportunity to draw closer to Him and align our will more with His. Let us take His divine hand every step of the way throughout our lives to navigate the many challenging turns that await us. And let’s light the fire within to achieve more than we perhaps think possible. Let’s light the divine fire within each of us to realize the divine potential we each have.

			<p>What a delight to be here. I have a very fond place in my heart for this wonderful institution and for all of the great work that is accomplished here. Thank you for joining me this morning. I would like to recognize my wife, Jennifer, with me here on the stand. She is my angel. I am also delighted to have my parents and children here.</p>
<p>On February 17, 2002, nervous anticipation filled the Salt Lake Ice Center for Apolo Ono’s first Olympic short-track, speed-skating final, the 1,000 meters. Apolo was heralded as an Olympian who had a chance to win four gold medals. He typically waits until late in the race to make his move, and this race was no different. With two laps remaining, he finally moved to the front of the pack of five skaters. On the very last corner, Apolo and Li Jiajun from China bumped lightly, then Li bumped Ahn Hyun-soo from Korea, and in an instant they found themselves spilled across the ice, sliding into the padded walls. Only the Australian, Steven Bradbury, remained upright to cross the finish line, the first Australian ever to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics. As he would later say, his strategy worked perfectly—he hoped the others would crash.</p>
<p>As Steven was crossing the finish line, the crowd breathed a collective groan, their hopes of an American gold medal fallen with Apolo, who was also injured in the crash with a gash that would require six stitches. Largely unnoticed in the instantaneous aftermath of the fallen skaters, Apolo scrambled to get up and slide, skate first, across the finish line. He knew that winning the silver medal was still possible and that what would determine his order of finish would be when his skate crossed the line. He barely edged out the Canadian for the silver medal. During the medal ceremony Apolo exuded how thrilled he was. He didn’t lose the gold. He won the silver. When Apolo fell, he not only got up, he got up quickly.</p>
<p>I would like to touch on a few lessons for life that we can learn—each illuminated from events in the Olympics. One of life’s experiences is that we all get knocked down. As in Apolo’s case, we are never sure what is around the next corner. In our case, we may not get knocked down on ice, but we can experience reversals in health, finances, or with family, friends, or other areas. Our challenge is what happens next. We need to get up and get up quickly. In our theme song for the Games, “Light the Fire Within,” sung by LeAnn Rimes, we find the following:</p>
<p><i>And if we fall,</i><br />
<i>We won’t stay down.</i><br />
<i>We will get back up</i><br />
<i>And use the strength we’ve found—</i><br />
<i>And we will rise</i><br />
<i>Like champions.</i></p>
<p><i>Every obstacle we’ll overcome.</i><br />
<i>Once in every lifetime</i><br />
<i>There’s a chance to stand apart.</i><br />
<i>We can show the world</i><br />
<i>Our very best,</i><br />
<i>Reveal what’s in our hearts.</i></p>
<p><i>And so the story goes and glory</i><br />
<i>Never will end.</i><br />
<i>Inspiration lights</i><br />
<i>The fire within.</i><br />
[“Light the Fire Within,” by David Foster and Linda Thompson]</p>
<p>Everyone faces challenges we never thought would come our way. The key question we face as a result of these reversals or trials is whether it will bring us closer to God. I believe we face this basic choice every time we encounter these difficulties: Will it push us farther away from God or bring us closer to Him? We should see more clearly our complete dependency upon God and humble ourselves in our relationship with Him.</p>
<p>The people of Alma provide an inspiring example and enlightenment on the trying times we encounter. In Mosiah 24:15 we read: “The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.” I believe one of the great purposes of the burdens we face is to recognize our dependence upon the Lord and to submit our will to His. Indeed, the Savior is our schoolmaster in this principle. In 3 Nephi 27:13 the Savior said, “I came into the world to do the will of my Father.” Is that not also true of us? Are we here to do the will of our Father? When we encounter such trials in our lives and at times feel helpless on our own to resolve them, we can turn to our Father for that source of divine assistance and in turn more closely mesh our will with His.</p>
<p>A second lesson was embodied in the experience of Jimmy Shea, Jr. Several years ago we asked the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, to add the skeleton back to the Winter Olympic program, particularly in light of the fact that, at the time, Jimmy Shea was one of the best in the world. We wanted the U.S. to do well in these Games. The skeleton is a sport in which competitors lie on a sled face first and fly down a bobsled track at 80 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Jimmy dreamed of becoming part of the first three-generation Olympic family in history, with both his father and grandfather having competed in the Olympics. We invited them to participate in the opening ceremonies, but then we were all struck by the tragic death of his 91-year-old grandfather last December when his car was hit by a drunk driver.</p>
<p>The day of the skeleton competition began with a light snow falling. Expectations were not high for Jimmy Shea, since for the past season his performance had not been up to what it had been previously. He had also been recovering from invasive surgery to his leg. However, after the end of the first of two runs, everyone was astonished to see him in first place. Because the athletes compete in reverse order of the standings, in the second run Jimmy would be last. The snow continued to fall, potentially making the track slower, even though we briefly cleaned it between each competitor. Jimmy began with a lead of five one-hundredths of a second, and as he moved through the turns, his lead became less and less. As he passed through the final time interval before the end, he was actually behind by one one-hundredth of a second. Experts in the sport tell you that it is impossible to make up time at the very end of the track. But when Jimmy Shea finished the last three turns, he ended up winning the gold by five one-hundredths of a second. We had witnessed a very magical, emotional moment, especially when he took a picture of his recently deceased grandfather out of his helmet. When asked how many Sheas were on the sled, Jimmy answered, “Two.” His father suggested that Grandfather Shea gave him a little extra push. It was like Jimmy had a divine hand pushing him down that last part of the track.</p>
<p>During the Games I am certain we had a divine hand with us. There were many instances when we received assistance beyond our capabilities. There was one area in particular that would dramatically affect the outcome of the Games—the weather. Wind and snow are very problematic—though you wouldn’t think so for the Winter Games. For example, we turned the downhill run into a sheet of ice. We used a water bar to inject water every eight inches into the entire slope and then let it freeze. The competitors’ skis bite more effectively and consistently into an icy surface. Imagine flying down a sheet of ice at 80 miles per hour. When it snows, it ruins the prepared surface, and we start over with 27 Sno-Cats and 1,600 volunteers just for the downhill runs.</p>
<p>We enjoyed miraculously superb weather during the Games, beginning with a storm the morning of the opening ceremonies to blow out the inversion and to put a blanket of white on the mountains. During the 17 days of the event we showcased the majestic, white mountains and deep blue skies of Utah. We could not have scripted better weather. It made a fundamental difference to the outcome of our Games.</p>
<p>As the closing ceremonies approached, I kept an eye on an approaching storm that was forecast to hit that evening. Late in the afternoon of the closing ceremonies I was in the stadium monitoring the load-in when the storm hit with large black clouds and then rain. It cleared out before the start of the ceremonies, but the forecast called for a major windstorm to come through between 7:30 and 9 p.m., right in the heart of our program. Winds would be a problem. They would hinder the dinosaurs, prevent the large balloons from being used, and, worst of all, cancel the fireworks—more than 36,000 shells.</p>
<p>I stayed in touch by cell phone with our weather center, which was tied into ground-monitoring stations for hundreds of miles. Each successive report updated the storm approaching Salt Lake from the west. Then, at 7:30, I received a call that went something like this: “The strangest thing has happened. A wind has come in from the east, which almost never happens. It has stalled the wind front over the Great Salt Lake, so you are good to go for the entire show.”</p>
<p>A feeling similar to electricity coursed through me. The closing ceremonies came off perfectly, and just 15 minutes after the stadium emptied, the storm hit with ferocity, tearing to shreds left-behind ponchos and programs. Mitt Romney and I watched this and commented that this was like a divine punctuation mark of who is really in charge. In our minds the weather was divinely provided.</p>
<p>We know we had a divine hand with us. We all have a divine hand in our lives. Our Father in Heaven and His Son care deeply for each of us. We need to recognize that They are ever present beside us to guide us along the way if we will but reach out to take the hand that is offered. It is real. It is a marvelous comfort. It is ever present, as we are worthy. It can keep us focused on our true mission in life as we take that divine hand and let it remind us and guide us in what we do. Remember that it is there.</p>
<p>One of the Olympic firsts for our Games was to choose a theme and amplify it through everything we did. Our theme was “Light the Fire Within,” suggesting to us all to strive harder, to reach higher to accomplish things we never thought possible. It also tied to the idea of inspiring others with that light kindled within each of us. You probably recall seeing the children of light throughout our ceremonies and at the Medals Plaza. The athletes certainly exemplify the theme of “Light the Fire Within” and the inspiration of achievement. There are dozens of stories, but one in particular is very poignant.</p>
<p>Eighteen months before the Games, Chris Klug lay on an operating table wondering if he would live. In 1998 he competed in Nagano in the men’s snowboard parallel giant slalom, finishing just out of the medals. His resolve was to compete in his home country, the United States. But in the summer of 2000 he was diagnosed with a life-threatening liver disease—the same disease that had taken the life of Walter Payton. Chris was wasting away, losing 30 pounds awaiting a liver transplant—a highly risky procedure, but his only hope to live. His operation was successful. He went into a special but very difficult training regimen, hoping to once again compete. At the Games he unexpectedly made it into the final round, and then—unbelievably—he won the bronze medal. He is the only organ transplant recipient ever to do so, and he won the medal on National Organ Transplant Awareness Day.</p>
<p>Chris was another example of “Light the Fire Within.” He had been knocked down but got back up and reached heights as yet unconquered. Focus and determination resulted in what almost all thought impossible. Each of us can strive to reach heights that may not seem possible today. Life is full of many twists and turns, and it is so exciting to contemplate what lies ahead of you. As you reach to light the fire within you, you become an inspiration to those around you. What you reach for may be in studies, career, or service to others. But it may also be to light the divine fire within yourself. Each of us has the seeds of divinity within us, lying dormant until we consciously plant them and nourish them to grow. Many times the goal may seem infinitely distant and the journey uncertain and challenging, but making that journey is what allows us to accomplish what we never thought possible and imparts some of life’s great lessons. So let each of us look inside ourselves to see how we may light that fire within and achieve more than we may think possible.</p>
<p>Certainly that was the case with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. I recall looking from the outside at the organization as the bribery scandal unfolded. I thought, “What a tragedy for our community, especially since we try to be the most honest of people.” Yet here were some of the headlines from around the world: “Biggest Scandal to Ever Hit the Olympics,” “Oly Scandal Leads to Resignation,” “Olympic Shame.” When I traveled across the U.S. or abroad during those times and mentioned that I was from Utah, I was met with comments about bribery and dishonesty. The thought of having great Olympic Games seemed an improbable dream.</p>
<p>Yet the people of Utah did have a dream to host the world. As the new management of SLOC, our objective was to do it in such a way that the past would fade away and be replaced with memories of magical Games. We had been knocked down, but it was time to get up and do what many thought impossible: put on great Games.</p>
<p>The Games were indeed magical. The headlines read: “The Little City That Could Did,” “2002 Olympics Light the Fire Within,” “Basking in Olympic Spirit,” and “Unbelievable Games.” Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said, “The Salt Lake Games are far and away the most successful Olympics, summer or winter, in history.” Jean Claude Killy said, “Salt Lake, we will always remember you. These were perfect Games.”</p>
<p>Our collective success had many sources. We had a great team, led by my partner Mitt Romney. We had superb organization. We had a divine hand of assistance. But one key factor noted throughout the world were the wonderful volunteers. President Jacques Rogge said to the world in the closing ceremonies, “Volunteers, you are, with the athletes, the champions of these Games. Your generosity and profound kindness has won our hearts. You were marvelous.” President Gordon B. Hinckley said in general conference last April, “I compliment and thank our people who participated in such numbers and so generously . . . to make of this a wonderful and most significant event” (“The Church Goes Forward,” <i>Ensign,</i> May 2002, 6). So I am here to thank the wonderful volunteers from the community and BYU. Thank you, BYU, for lending us thousands of your superb students and for the wonderful job they did in hosting the world.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you a key statistic regarding these volunteers. In every Games previous to ours, the attrition rate of volunteers was 15 to 20 percent. In our Games we had attrition of less than 1 percent—an Olympic record.</p>
<p>As a thank-you for BYU’s partnership in hosting these Games, allow me to present you with an Olympic torch. President Bateman, you will note that the inscription on the torch reads, “Light the Fire Within,” something exemplified by your fine students.</p>
<p>Last summer, in commemorating the pioneers, President Hinckley quoted Brigham Young, who said, “Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here” (in <i>Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown</i> [Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1900; New York: AMS Press, 1971], 122; cited by Preston Nibley in <i>Brigham Young: The Man and His Work</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936], 128). During the Games we had more than 140 dignitaries from around the world, in addition to our own president, vice president, and most of the cabinet. After the conclusion of the Games, President Hinckley said in April conference that “we have witnessed the fulfillment of that prophecy in these recent days” (“The Church Goes Forward,” 6). He also said, “But out of all of this came something wonderful for this Church. Representatives of the media, so often a tough and calloused group, with very few exceptions spoke and wrote in language both complimentary and accurately descriptive of a unique culture they found here . . . , of the spirit of hospitality which they felt” (“The Church Goes Forward,” 5).</p>
<p>Now when I travel around the world and mention that I am from Salt Lake City, a smile comes to the eyes, followed by a warm handshake thanking us for marvelous Games. These Games were important for our community and for the Church. Many around the world did not even know of us, but now they do. And their reactions are almost universally positive and warm. Salt Lake City is now an Olympic city, and one with the magical Games.</p>
<p>As we continue our journey in life, let us follow some of these simple lessons. We will get knocked down—and many times unexpectedly—but when we do, let’s get up, and let’s get up quickly. Let’s rely on the Lord and use the opportunity to draw closer to Him and align our will more with His. Let us take His divine hand every step of the way throughout our lives to navigate the many challenging turns that await us. And let’s light the fire within to achieve more than we perhaps think possible. Let’s light the divine fire within each of us to realize the divine potential we each have.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My beloved brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you today. I love this university for many reasons—not the least of these is the fact that I attended school here, as did my wife, our five children, and four of five of their spouses. I suppose you could say that I have a personal, financial investment in this university.
I love that so many wonderful, intelligent disciples of the Savior come to this campus to dedicate themselves to the pursuit of truth and to seek temporal and spiritual knowledge.
I have already said that I love this university. What I didn’t tell you was that I also carry fond feelings for this building in which we are seated today.
As I was watching students enter the building this morning, it brought back a flood of memories. For a moment it seemed as though time had rolled back, and I could see myself as a student your age, entering this very building.
However, in my case, the reason I most often entered this building was to work the midnight cleanup shift here at the Marriott Activities Center. If you look around, you will see the very places I walked with broom and mop, tidying up after devotionals, basketball games, and special events. So for those of you who might be tempted to litter while you are here, please keep in mind that I will be watching.
This campus is sacred. While I worked and studied here, I also pondered questions that many of you might be asking at this time of your life:
• What should I study?
• What will become of me?
• Does the Lord care which career I choose?
• Will I ever meet someone, fall in love, and get married?
• Will I find happiness and success in life?
I have to tell you that these questions felt all consuming and even frightening at times. I honestly didn’t know exactly where my life would go when I was your age. One thing is certain: I never imagined as I was sweeping this great hall that one day I would be at this pulpit speaking to you.
Today I want to address two of the questions you might be asking—things I myself desperately wanted to know when I was your age.
First, if you dedicate your life to God’s ­service, will He direct your steps and use you for His righteous purposes?
Second, if you choose to follow the Savior and walk in the path of discipleship, will the Lord watch over you, guide you, bless you, and fill you with a spirit of joy and fulfillment?
A Temple in Philadelphia
In the ten years prior to my being called to the Presiding Bishopric, I had the blessing and privilege of helping to identify and acquire sites for temples.
A few years ago President Thomas S. Monson announced that there would be a ­temple in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, so we went to work researching possible sites where that temple could be built. Two sites ultimately emerged—and it just so happened that they were across the street from each o</span>

Graduation is properly a time of celebration—a time to rejoice in the success you have all achieved in earning your degree. It is also properly a time to look forward to what lies ahead—that is in part why we call this ­ceremony a commencement.
Many of you will go immediately into your first post-college full-time job. Others will head to graduate school. Some will dedicate themselves to the full-time pursuit of raising children. Each of these new adventures will likely be challenging, stimulating, and, in a few cases, close to all consuming—in ways that may cause you to lose perspective.
As you begin this next phase of your life, especially the majority of you who will eventually spend most of your waking hours in a career outside the home, I ask you to reflect on the words of Os Guinness, who astutely observed that, in today’s society,
work takes up so many of our waking hours that our jobs come to define us and give us our ­identities. We become what we do.1
The world would often teach us that we are what we do. It does not take long in most social gatherings to realize this. One of the first questions that is asked when meeting a new person in a professional setting is “What do you do?” The answer to that question not only determines the subject and length of the ensuing conversation but also often creates the identity of the respondent from that point on.
Guinness urges us to not fall into the trap of defining ourselves by our jobs but instead to view our jobs—indeed, our entire lives—as a calling and to choose our jobs and how we fulfill them by determining who we are. In his words:
Calling reverses [the world’s] thinking. . . . Instead of, “You are what you do,” calling says: “Do what you are.”2
I urge you to consider this concept as you move ahead with your lives, because who you are is extraordinary—“beloved . . . son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents” with “a divine nature and destiny.”3 And as a result of who you are—and who you can become—you can have a profound impact on those around you, not only in your jobs but also in your communities and, most important, in your homes.
Because you have lived in the unique environment that is Brigham Young University for the past few years, you may overlook the depth of the impact that those who become what the university and the gospel urge them to become can have on others on this campus.
In 2005, Naomi Schaeffer Riley wrote a book about religiously affiliated universities in the United States. The book is entitled God on the Quad. Riley began her book describing a speech given by author Tom Wolfe at a Class Day address at Harvard in which Wolfe described our current time frame as “the era of the ‘fifth</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What an awesome sight to look over this blue sea of BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the world’s greatest universities. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One privilege that is mine as alumni president is to officially welcome you into our BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer upon each of you a lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 410,000 living alumni. You will have many opportunities over the years to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with this university.
The mission of BYU “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”1 This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn’t end, your quest doesn’t end, and our relationship doesn’t end. Our mission as alumni is to extend this marvelous BYU experience beyond graduation and build lifelong relationships with our alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you have learned here. We hope that you will treasure these great lessons and stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Through our alumni campaign—we call it RISE—we have begun collecting the stories of more than 6,700 of our former students. Here is just one of them.
Arizona graduate Duane Oakes initially struggled to find his place at BYU. With only a few friends and no family nearby, he was contemplating returning home when he met a student-government advisor who told him he wasn’t going anywhere because she was going to mentor him. As he was helped, he discovered that he had a passion for helping other students and became involved. Through an educational career he has devoted himself to keeping the legacy going of the things he learned at BYU. He stayed involved.
Now Duane serves on the faculty of Mesa Community College and directs the Center for Community and Civic Engagement. He and his wife now lead the Arizona BYU Alumni Chapter in Phoenix. We love his story. We would love to hear your stories, and we invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
You are now entering another phase of your eternal progression. We hope your experiences at the Y have opened your eyes to future possibilities. Understand that none of us has “arrived.” We are all in a process of “becoming.” As you know, that process is fraught with trials and tests. But fundamental to this process is our belief in the fact that we can become what our Heavenly Father wants us to be.
Let me share a favorite story: Hope for the Flowers by Trina Paulus. This is a story of how two cater­pillars traversed the trials and risks in their lives to become beautiful butterflies. It started with discovering what a butterf</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, Elder Oaks, for your very important address. My wife, Wendy, had planned to be with us today. Unfortunately, she sprained her ankle and is propped up at home watching these proceedings on TV. She was on the faculty here for thirteen years. We love BYU. She joins me in extending our heartfelt congratulations to all graduates and their families. We are especially grateful for the excellent messages given by three of the leading lights of this dispensation: President Kevin J Worthen, Dr. Donald B. Doty, and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.
President Worthen stands tall in his position as the thirteenth president of the university. He excelled in his chosen field of law and once served as dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and as advancement vice president at BYU. In the Church he serves as an Area Seventy. We trust him. His peers look up to him. His students emulate him.
Dr. Donald B. Doty is regarded across the globe as the premiere teacher of cardiac surgery. His textbooks are used by specialists throughout the world. You will want to read every word of his amazing biographical summary in your commencement program. While excelling in his profession, he has served in the Church as bishop, stake president, regional representative, and Area Seventy. Later we called upon him to direct the medical affairs of the Missionary Department, which he did as a volunteer for nine years. We are most grateful for his and Cheryl’s building a network of help for our missionaries that will endure for years. We love them and salute them today, particularly Brother Doty as he gets his honorary degree. No one could be more deserving.
Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were called to the Quorum of the Twelve in April 1984. It has been my rare privilege to sit beside him in our quorum meetings for more than thirty-one years. You know of Elder Oaks’ past service as the eighth president of BYU and as a justice of the supreme court of the state of Utah. Today you heard him talk about your need to take heart. He also asked you to consider what God wants you to be: to be joyful, to be creative, and to develop a love of God that will bring you a fulness of joy.
Now, let me share a thought for you graduates. You are entering a new phase of life. To this point you have been striving to meet expectations imposed upon you by other people. You have passed exams and may have to pass others in order to become certified. You have been jumping over high hurdles established by others. In order to prepare for what you want to do in life, this is good. But with this transition in the pursuit of your formal education, you need to continue to focus on becoming the person the Lord needs you to be. Strive to develop the spiritual attributes of faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence.
These attributes are difficult to measure, but they constitute the substance of what the Lord hopes fo</span>
