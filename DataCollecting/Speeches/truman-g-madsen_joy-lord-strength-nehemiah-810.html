  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Brothers and sisters, the chorale has given my message in music and President Bateman has given my message in prose. So lets go back to class.

Ann and I are grateful to be in your midst in the Thanksgiving season. I have a cheerful message, and smiles will be permitted and even encouraged.

"Im writing a book on joy," said a rabbi to a colleague of mine in New York. That book found that one root of the word &lt;i&gt;joy&lt;/i&gt; in the Old Testament is &lt;i&gt;chemdah.&lt;/i&gt;When it is conjoined with the phrase "of the Lord," it means three things. It means gladness; it means togetherness or being joined one with another; and it means something about the temple. Nehemiah was the rebuilder of the temple. The phrase "joy of the Lord" attends his invitation to the newly rebuilt temple.

Now our sacred texts place joy in the same mode, and our history writes it in flesh and blood.

Brigham Young, whose institution this is, said about the terrible persecutions and drivings of our people:

&lt;i&gt;You that have not passed through the trials, and persecutions . . . , but have only read of them . . . may think how awful they were to endure, and wonder that the Saints survived them at all. The thought of it makes your hearts sink within you . . . , and you are ready to exclaim, "I could not have endured it." I have been in the heat of it, and I never felt better in all my life; I never felt the peace and power of the Almighty more copiously poured upon me than in the keenest part of our trials. They appeared nothing to me. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 1:313]

Brigham Young has a witness, Heber C. Kimball, who said:

&lt;i&gt;Often when I have been in the presence of brother Brigham, we would feel such a buoyant spirit that when we began to talk we could not express our feelings, and so, "Hallelujah," says Brigham, "Glory to God," says I. I feel it and say it. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 4:222]

A second witness is Eliza R. Snow, who said, "None but saints can be happy under every circumstance" (in Edward W. Tullidge, &lt;i&gt;The Women of Mormondom&lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City: s.n., 1975], 146).

My great-grandfather Jedediah M. Grant once said that even when he was at the grave site of his baby girl buried on the plains, he felt near unto heaven. He said:

&lt;i&gt;It has given me much of trouble, and a great amount of perseverance, to be happy under all circumstances. I have learned not to fret myself. It has taken me a great while to arrive at this point. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . I thank the Lord for the bitter as well as for the sweet. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . I want the Saints to live in a way that they can feel happy all the time, and then we shall enjoy the Holy Spirit. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 3:1112]

We all know that the Spirit brings joy. The revelation to me is that joy brings the Spirit. When we are happy, the Spirit flows more freely - otherwise, it does not.

Looking back, our Church presidents and also their wives have said together in different ways that because of the gospel and the joy of the Lord, the sufferings of the wicked are far more than the sufferings of the righteous. And the Plains epic is their metaphor for our lives.

Remember, adventurers and fortune seekers left civilization, and left acting civilized, to race west to the mines - every man for himself. The Saints became a community on wheels. They were linked by a common cause. They went in the name of the Lord. The desperadoes and the explorers went with the obsession to be first and to strike it rich and to jump claims - even to gun down their opponents. The Mormon Battalion left the goldfields without gold to return to their wives and families and to create a new culture and a new civilization in the vision of Zion. The Saints sometimes died in each others arms with a prayer. That cannot be said of some of those in the Donner party. The Saints had covenanted to pool their resources so that every person - able-bodied or not - could make this rite of passage. Their temple was burned behind them; their anticipated temple was 1,000 miles and 40 years away. But the beginning and end of their journey was Christ.

Now, what of today? Perhaps we can credit the computer for our increasing impatience. This generation is intent on what they want and how they want it and when. Dont wait for next week. Forget others. Forget nonsense about rules. Play the game your way. Cut corners. Make your own rules. We may be in the midst of the most impatient generation in history. But the truth is that all supernal joys take time and discipline and discipleship.

We are taught that the opposite of humility is arrogance, and our prophet has recently alerted us against that. I suggest that the opposite of meekness is demandingness. "I demand mine." Some of us are apparently willing to do anything wrong in order to get our rights. But the teaching of Jesus turns that upside down. The meek will inherit the earth precisely because they understand the kind of caring that leads to sharing. And they demand, like the Christ, nothing. They pray as He prayed for deliverance and relief. But their blessings flow unto them without compulsory means because they submit to a higher and wiser will.

In the academy just now, one of the purr words is &lt;i&gt;postmodernism.&lt;/i&gt; The superficialized thesis is that anything goes, that no one can say what is true or false or what is good or bad. But this stance is not really post- and it is not modern. It was old when Socrates was young. I submit that it is sometimes willful ignorance of human history - that a self-centered life is just as good as any other life. That is the attitude, I suggest, of sick souls. When it enters our presence, it becomes the 14th article of faith, which negates the other 13: "We believe in narcissism." Modern scripture has a definition of this. It is called "seeking to be a law unto yourself." For such there is a guaranteed result.

It was Dostoyevskys character Ivan Karamazov who believed that if God is dead, then everything is allowed. Well, both the premise and the conclusion are misleading. Neither God nor law tell you what you must do. That is a fiction. They tell you what the inevitable consequences will be of what you do do. So here is an absolute that is not obsolete. It is more reliable than the second law of thermodynamics. Put negatively, if you seek your own immediate gratification and ignore, neglect, or, worse, exploit others, you will not find joy. You will find a chimera. And if you persist, you will find misery. You cannot find joy that way any more than you can jump off your own shadow.

As a little boy I used to try to see the refrigerator door turn the light off. Did you ever try that? I hurt my nose badly. You cant see the light turn off because the door is closed before the light goes off. Let us put it positively, as Jesus did: "If you lose yourself for my sake and the gospels, you will rejoice and be exceeding glad. You will experience the joy of the Lord."

For it is not chance but choice that is involved here. Each of us has some control over finding joy. To paraphrase Elder Marion D. Hanks: "No matter how we live, there will be pain in this world. But misery is optional." Think about it. Christ is against selfishness and sin - not because He is the giant spoilsport, but the other way around. He is against sin and selfishness because He is against despondency and melancholy and morbidity. He is against the shrinking of our capacity for fulfillment. On this He is the worlds leading expert. He knows. As the book of Hebrews has it, "For the joy that was set before him [He] endured the cross" (Hebrews 12:2). Whose joy did He envision? Ours. He saw beyond our sins and stupidities and our clumsy mistakes. He knows what we have within us to become. And having paid the awful price in blood, He is entitled to alert us to reality.

This changes the kinds of questions we ask of life. Instead of "Whats in it for me?" we ask, "Whats in it for those I love or should love?" Instead of "Why am I having such a hard time?" we ask, "Am I growing through my hard times? Can I see any meaning or purpose for the good of the kingdom in my struggle?" Instead of "How soon can I get what I want?" we ask, "Can I train my desires to be a better friend of Christ?" All these questions become prayers: "And however long it takes, dear Lord, stay with me."

For the Latter-day Saints the plight is better - or worse. We were not only born with the Light of Christ, but we have also been exposed to an environment of light. We have been exposed to the roots and the fruits of the tree of life. In our hearts we all know the difference between His way and all other ways. One result is expressed in Heber C. Kimballs ungrammatical sentence after the Saints had made covenants in the Nauvoo Temple. He said, "You cant sin so cheap no more" (1844 journal, LDS Church Historical Library, Salt Lake City).

Whatever diminishes our relish for spiritual things, whatever we cannot consistently invite the Spirit to attend, is not for us. Sin and selfishness are furtive, they are half-hearted, and they are self-dividing. But Christs way is whole-hearted, and the wholeness becomes holiness. Sin cannot sing. The music of sin is a dirge. It is a wilderness crying in a voice. But Christs way is song - a new song, a lifting song. Sin loves darkness and covers up. It is darkening. But Christs way is light. And light cleaves to light. Sin and the defiant defense of sin is ugly. Christs way is beautiful. And everlastingly so. There is no joy in iniquity and, contrary to the world, there is no joy in inequity. We are promised that one day, should we be faithful, we will be equal in heavenly things and even ultimately in earthly things.

Now let me name three dimensions of joy - all of which, I think, require the Spirit and revelatory awareness.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The Joys of Mission&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
These are what I call right-track feelings: the sense that no matter where we are or what we are doing, we are on the Lords errand - that we are serving Him even in trifles. The conviction is that where you are is the best place for you to be as long as you need to be there. This applies even to sickbeds and dentists chairs. It even applies to prisons. Such a sermon was delivered in the state penitentiary. Afterward, a young man forgot himself and prayed, "Bless all those who arent here this time that they may be here next time." That is going a little too far.

In the Church, our purr word is &lt;i&gt;active,&lt;/i&gt; and it is of course crucial. But even if we are partially disabled - and we are, most of us, in various ways - even then, if the heart is continually filled with righteous desires, they themselves are transforming. The activity Christ most cares about is within us amidst the bustle. In short, wherever we are can be a pleasant place if Christ approves us there and attends us there.

It is said that a man in Jerusalem was given a job of going daily to a flat roof and looking toward the east to anticipate the Messiah. Asked about it, he said, "Well, the pay isnt much, but the work is steady." We all have that steady job. It was assigned us by the Master - assigned the Saints when they were driven out in midwinter in Missouri. The counsel was, "Seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls" (D&amp;amp;C 101:38). Again, at Winter Quarters, history repeated itself. The Lord said, "If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful" (D&amp;amp;C 136:29). When He said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33), His disciples had almost nothing to cheer about except their relationship with Him and the transcending anticipation of His return.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The Joys of the Senses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
H. L. Mencken scored religious people as those who live in mortal dread "that someone, somewhere, may be happy" (in "Sententiae," &lt;i&gt;A Mencken Chrestomathy&lt;/i&gt; [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949], 624). It is a sharp indictment. It is also one of the superstitions of the irreligious, I suggest, that religious people cannot have fun. We work at it in this church. Well, our religion is not Menckens religion. It is the religion of the glad tidings of the Master. Notice His promised rewards for keeping the Sabbath. He only imposed one condition. He said we should keep the Sabbath "with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance" (D&amp;amp;C 59:15). And then He promised

&lt;i&gt;the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . To please the eye and to gladden the heart;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . For food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 59:3, 1819]

He calls this "the fulness of the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 59:16). He even defines fasting and prayer - fasting ordinarily conjoined with mourning - with rejoicing and prayer (vs. 14).

Further, the Master did not say we would only be happy when we transcend the earth. He said, instead, that this very earth transformed will become heaven. He said that even here we may begin to enjoy that which shall be in full hereafter. At this level, joy and pleasure are not opposed - they are combined.

When Jesus said through John in his epistle, "Love not the world," He meant, "Love not the wickedness of the world" (JST 1 John 2:15).

And when He said to keep "unspotted from the world" (D&amp;amp;C 59:9), it was actually to keep "unspotted from the vices of the world" (JST James 1:27).

He did not say the body is intrinsically evil. Yes, this body can be easily perverted and abused, but He taught that this body is a temple that is a house of light and glory. It can be a Stradivarius violin on which, if we permit Him, He can, as Master Musician, play. I was struck this morning again by a line reflecting Joseph Smith: "Man of himself is an instrument of music" (Joseph Young, "Vocal Music," &lt;i&gt;History of the Organization of the Seventies&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Joseph E. Massey Restoration Publisher, 1970], 14). Through his modern prophet the Lord has promised that the Spirit will not only illumine our minds but heighten all our senses - sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. What else is a glorious resurrection?

Now the devils game is to convince you that he is the king of enjoyment. He advertises shortcuts to ecstasy. "Buy into my game," he says, "and the rewards are all here in glittering neon." But, as usual, he lies. He lies big time. In wrath over his own permanent unembodiment, he either taunts us that the body is nothing - and we seek then a kind of negative spirituality - or he tells us the opposite. The body is everything. And you know where that leads. In abject misery of his own making, he seeks to make all men miserable like himself. He is a double-crosser. He keeps no promises. He not only doesnt deliver, he enslaves. He is the saddest of sadists in the universe.

The Savior, in contrast, will never, ever tamper with your freedom, except if you cooperate with Him to increase it. I count 75 times in the Doctrine and Covenants where He pleads with us to "ask, seek." But He will not force. He has everything to give that the devil claims to have, and He has never broken a promise yet.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. The Joys of Contemplation and Anticipation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Jesus said in modern revelation, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). Is there joy in learning, however difficult? Yes. All learning can be fulfilling and helpful: skills, talents, problem solving, earning a living. But below that is an undergirding quest. Listen to what He most wants us to learn. The Lord finished His sentence with "that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things - that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). Peaceable things? That which bringeth joy? The context of this is the temple. Temples are where all levels of joy combine, where togetherness with Him and with others is hallowed and sealed into families. The temple is a magnifying glass of such learning and of such lasting love. There you see your mission in life in the framework of eternity. There mind and spirit and senses are reawakened to the grandeur of the earth and of its joys. The temple is our most direct access to His mighty intelligence. And I trust the line that He is "more intelligent than they all" (Abraham 3:19). This is the glory of God. This is light and truth.

In the house of the Lord, it is as if we are in the Panama Canal. The Spirit comes up, as it were, under us and lifts us, and when we leave, we leave on a different ocean. But at the same time we are there, the vessel itself is healed and repaired and recommissioned and floats away prepared for the batterings and the confusions of daily life. The Prophet said, speaking of these heavenly, peace-giving truths:

&lt;i&gt;I can taste the principles of eternal life, and so can you. . . . You say honey is sweet, and so do I. I can also taste the spirit of eternal life. I know that it is good; and when I tell you of these things which were given me by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, you are bound to receive them as sweet, and rejoice more and more.&lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 6:312]

In the original Joseph Smith said, "&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; rejoice more and more." Which did he mean? I, or you? He meant both, because in that process, we have been told, "both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22). The temple and those within it are a perpetual prayer for the fulness of the Holy Ghost. And that means ultimately the fulness of joy (see D&amp;amp;C 109:15, 7980).

But is there such a thing as the fulness of joy? Well, there is a portrait of how these dimensions came together once in this world. Near a temple in a land called Bountiful, Jesus, who had been rejected and crucified and abandoned, now found Himself in the midst of a multitude of men, women, and children who had survived a three-hour earthquake. (By the way, this is one of the most authentic notes in the Book of Mormon. It says "three hours." But then there is another phrase: "and it was said by some that the time was greater" [3 Nephi 8:19]. Ive been in a 20-second earthquake, and I was already in serious trouble.)

As we are told in 3 Nephi 17, the people of Bountiful not only listened but received Him for whom He is. He could not do many mighty works at home, but in His new home He healed the crippled and the wounded and perhaps those who had other kinds of afflictions. All of them fell to their knees and in prayer poured out gratitude. The Book of Mormon says the Spirit taught them what they should pray. They had been commanded, as we have, to pray to the Father in the name of Christ. But now they prayed to Him, calling Him their Lord and their God.

And the Lord said, almost apologetically, in His prayer, "Father, . . . they pray unto me because I am with them" (3 Nephi 19:22). In how many ways with them! He prayed that they would be one with Him, as He is with the Father. And now they were.

Does the story end there? Not yet. He had called for their little children. Textbooks say that children have some innate fears, among them the fear of falling, the fear of loud noises, the identification with the terror and screams of others. Dont you think little children after a three-hour earthquake would be clinging to their parents, bewildered, and shyly recoiling from strangers?

But He was no stranger. All of the children were brought forward and were completely comfortable in His presence. He then said, "Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full" (3 Nephi 17:20). This is the only place in scripture that I know of where He spoke of His own fulness of joy. When He had said these words, He wept. And with exquisite tenderness He scooped the little children up one by one and blessed them as the parents and grown-up children beheld.

Shortly after a sacramental feast, Christ turned from His own prayers to see them all - men, women, and children - kneeling, whitened and lightened and transformed. In the record we are told that what they saw and felt defied words. But they tried. They said, "No one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father" (3 Nephi 17:17). He bade them arise, but they did not because they were overcome. The power of that experience lasted in the memories of their children and their childrens children for 200 years.

The resurrected Jesus Christ was the fulfillment in their presence of His own prophecy to us. "Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33). The joy of the Lord became their strength, as it can become ours.

My Quaker great-grandmother was named Rachel. Joseph Smith taught her. She had to reverse her notions from the past that there was little or no room for singing or dancing or playfulness or humor or for turning fasting into feasting. But on the theme of cultivating the inner light, she found in the fulness of the gospel confirmation of her earlier faith. Widowed nine days after the birth of her only son, she toiled her way through nagging poverty. She forced the bishop to take her tithing when there were six pans on the floor catching the leaks from the roof. And, brothers and sisters, in this day of growth in the Church, just count Chile and the Philippines only and you have a million Latter-day Saints who are living pretty much with a tin roof and a dirt floor and the 23rd Psalm on the wall.

Rachel served for 35 years as a Relief Society president. Even while hurting, she helped those who hurt more. During those years she was completely deaf and therefore more sensitive to the Light or its absence in those around her. She could not believe the promise made her by a patriarch that as Rachel of old she would have a worthy posterity. She had only one son. Her own portraits and the fading photographs are a study of clear eyes and serenity - she had the face of a saint. Last night we attended the 100th family reunion of her posterity. There are 700, and they are all of them in the world and of the world of Jesus Christ.

Brothers and sisters, this Light of the Spirit cannot be faked. All of the theater lights and stages and camera trickery and Photoshop manipulation may convince the unaware that artificial light has the same effect. It does not. Artificial light ends with the flipping of a switch. It is merely a backhanded tribute to Light. Christ is the Life and the Light - the Light that lightens hearts through thick and thin.

So I sum this up with two quotations again from Brother Brigham:

&lt;i&gt;There is not a man or woman on this earth, whose peace is made with God, and who are associated with holy beings, and seeking after holy principles, but their countenances are lit up with a lamp of divine cheerfulness.&lt;/i&gt; [Sermon by Brigham Young, 1 October 1854, Historians Office Report of Speeches, LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City]

And again, elsewhere:

&lt;i&gt;I say, if you want to enjoy exquisitely, become a Latter-day Saint, and then live the doctrine of Jesus Christ. The man or woman who will do this will enjoy and endure most; and if they will be humble and faithful they will enjoy the glory and the excellency of the power of God, and be prepared to live with Gods and with angels. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 18:247]

We are approaching the season to be jolly. But it can be more - it can be the season to be joyful. Let us come and adore Him. Let us sing the "songs of everlasting joy" (D&amp;amp;C 109:39, 133:33).

My testimony is this: I have been around a while, and I have read and spent at least half of my life looking at alternative religions and outlooks. And I suppose also I am a bit of an expert on the alternative death styles that are out there. One of the strongest arguments ever imposed upon me against this religion is that it is too good to be true. My testimony to you is, it is good and true and beautiful. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Brothers and sisters, the chorale has given my message in music and President Bateman has given my message in prose. So lets go back to class.</p>
<p>Ann and I are grateful to be in your midst in the Thanksgiving season. I have a cheerful message, and smiles will be permitted and even encouraged.</p>
<p>"Im writing a book on joy," said a rabbi to a colleague of mine in New York. That book found that one root of the word <i>joy</i> in the Old Testament is <i>chemdah.</i>When it is conjoined with the phrase "of the Lord," it means three things. It means gladness; it means togetherness or being joined one with another; and it means something about the temple. Nehemiah was the rebuilder of the temple. The phrase "joy of the Lord" attends his invitation to the newly rebuilt temple.</p>
<p>Now our sacred texts place joy in the same mode, and our history writes it in flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Brigham Young, whose institution this is, said about the terrible persecutions and drivings of our people:</p>
<p><i>You that have not passed through the trials, and persecutions . . . , but have only read of them . . . may think how awful they were to endure, and wonder that the Saints survived them at all. The thought of it makes your hearts sink within you . . . , and you are ready to exclaim, "I could not have endured it." I have been in the heat of it, and I never felt better in all my life; I never felt the peace and power of the Almighty more copiously poured upon me than in the keenest part of our trials. They appeared nothing to me. </i>[<i>JD</i> 1:313]</p>
<p>Brigham Young has a witness, Heber C. Kimball, who said:</p>
<p><i>Often when I have been in the presence of brother Brigham, we would feel such a buoyant spirit that when we began to talk we could not express our feelings, and so, "Hallelujah," says Brigham, "Glory to God," says I. I feel it and say it. </i>[<i>JD</i> 4:222]</p>
<p>A second witness is Eliza R. Snow, who said, "None but saints can be happy under every circumstance" (in Edward W. Tullidge, <i>The Women of Mormondom</i>[Salt Lake City: s.n., 1975], 146).</p>
<p>My great-grandfather Jedediah M. Grant once said that even when he was at the grave site of his baby girl buried on the plains, he felt near unto heaven. He said:</p>
<p><i>It has given me much of trouble, and a great amount of perseverance, to be happy under all circumstances. I have learned not to fret myself. It has taken me a great while to arrive at this point. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . I thank the Lord for the bitter as well as for the sweet. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . I want the Saints to live in a way that they can feel happy all the time, and then we shall enjoy the Holy Spirit. </i>[<i>JD</i> 3:1112]</p>
<p>We all know that the Spirit brings joy. The revelation to me is that joy brings the Spirit. When we are happy, the Spirit flows more freely - otherwise, it does not.</p>
<p>Looking back, our Church presidents and also their wives have said together in different ways that because of the gospel and the joy of the Lord, the sufferings of the wicked are far more than the sufferings of the righteous. And the Plains epic is their metaphor for our lives.</p>
<p>Remember, adventurers and fortune seekers left civilization, and left acting civilized, to race west to the mines - every man for himself. The Saints became a community on wheels. They were linked by a common cause. They went in the name of the Lord. The desperadoes and the explorers went with the obsession to be first and to strike it rich and to jump claims - even to gun down their opponents. The Mormon Battalion left the goldfields without gold to return to their wives and families and to create a new culture and a new civilization in the vision of Zion. The Saints sometimes died in each others arms with a prayer. That cannot be said of some of those in the Donner party. The Saints had covenanted to pool their resources so that every person - able-bodied or not - could make this rite of passage. Their temple was burned behind them; their anticipated temple was 1,000 miles and 40 years away. But the beginning and end of their journey was Christ.</p>
<p>Now, what of today? Perhaps we can credit the computer for our increasing impatience. This generation is intent on what they want and how they want it and when. Dont wait for next week. Forget others. Forget nonsense about rules. Play the game your way. Cut corners. Make your own rules. We may be in the midst of the most impatient generation in history. But the truth is that all supernal joys take time and discipline and discipleship.</p>
<p>We are taught that the opposite of humility is arrogance, and our prophet has recently alerted us against that. I suggest that the opposite of meekness is demandingness. "I demand mine." Some of us are apparently willing to do anything wrong in order to get our rights. But the teaching of Jesus turns that upside down. The meek will inherit the earth precisely because they understand the kind of caring that leads to sharing. And they demand, like the Christ, nothing. They pray as He prayed for deliverance and relief. But their blessings flow unto them without compulsory means because they submit to a higher and wiser will.</p>
<p>In the academy just now, one of the purr words is <i>postmodernism.</i> The superficialized thesis is that anything goes, that no one can say what is true or false or what is good or bad. But this stance is not really post- and it is not modern. It was old when Socrates was young. I submit that it is sometimes willful ignorance of human history - that a self-centered life is just as good as any other life. That is the attitude, I suggest, of sick souls. When it enters our presence, it becomes the 14th article of faith, which negates the other 13: "We believe in narcissism." Modern scripture has a definition of this. It is called "seeking to be a law unto yourself." For such there is a guaranteed result.</p>
<p>It was Dostoyevskys character Ivan Karamazov who believed that if God is dead, then everything is allowed. Well, both the premise and the conclusion are misleading. Neither God nor law tell you what you must do. That is a fiction. They tell you what the inevitable consequences will be of what you do do. So here is an absolute that is not obsolete. It is more reliable than the second law of thermodynamics. Put negatively, if you seek your own immediate gratification and ignore, neglect, or, worse, exploit others, you will not find joy. You will find a chimera. And if you persist, you will find misery. You cannot find joy that way any more than you can jump off your own shadow.</p>
<p>As a little boy I used to try to see the refrigerator door turn the light off. Did you ever try that? I hurt my nose badly. You cant see the light turn off because the door is closed before the light goes off. Let us put it positively, as Jesus did: "If you lose yourself for my sake and the gospels, you will rejoice and be exceeding glad. You will experience the joy of the Lord."</p>
<p>For it is not chance but choice that is involved here. Each of us has some control over finding joy. To paraphrase Elder Marion D. Hanks: "No matter how we live, there will be pain in this world. But misery is optional." Think about it. Christ is against selfishness and sin - not because He is the giant spoilsport, but the other way around. He is against sin and selfishness because He is against despondency and melancholy and morbidity. He is against the shrinking of our capacity for fulfillment. On this He is the worlds leading expert. He knows. As the book of Hebrews has it, "For the joy that was set before him [He] endured the cross" (Hebrews 12:2). Whose joy did He envision? Ours. He saw beyond our sins and stupidities and our clumsy mistakes. He knows what we have within us to become. And having paid the awful price in blood, He is entitled to alert us to reality.</p>
<p>This changes the kinds of questions we ask of life. Instead of "Whats in it for me?" we ask, "Whats in it for those I love or should love?" Instead of "Why am I having such a hard time?" we ask, "Am I growing through my hard times? Can I see any meaning or purpose for the good of the kingdom in my struggle?" Instead of "How soon can I get what I want?" we ask, "Can I train my desires to be a better friend of Christ?" All these questions become prayers: "And however long it takes, dear Lord, stay with me."</p>
<p>For the Latter-day Saints the plight is better - or worse. We were not only born with the Light of Christ, but we have also been exposed to an environment of light. We have been exposed to the roots and the fruits of the tree of life. In our hearts we all know the difference between His way and all other ways. One result is expressed in Heber C. Kimballs ungrammatical sentence after the Saints had made covenants in the Nauvoo Temple. He said, "You cant sin so cheap no more" (1844 journal, LDS Church Historical Library, Salt Lake City).</p>
<p>Whatever diminishes our relish for spiritual things, whatever we cannot consistently invite the Spirit to attend, is not for us. Sin and selfishness are furtive, they are half-hearted, and they are self-dividing. But Christs way is whole-hearted, and the wholeness becomes holiness. Sin cannot sing. The music of sin is a dirge. It is a wilderness crying in a voice. But Christs way is song - a new song, a lifting song. Sin loves darkness and covers up. It is darkening. But Christs way is light. And light cleaves to light. Sin and the defiant defense of sin is ugly. Christs way is beautiful. And everlastingly so. There is no joy in iniquity and, contrary to the world, there is no joy in inequity. We are promised that one day, should we be faithful, we will be equal in heavenly things and even ultimately in earthly things.</p>
<p>Now let me name three dimensions of joy - all of which, I think, require the Spirit and revelatory awareness.</p>
<h2><b>1. The Joys of Mission</b></h2>
<p>These are what I call right-track feelings: the sense that no matter where we are or what we are doing, we are on the Lords errand - that we are serving Him even in trifles. The conviction is that where you are is the best place for you to be as long as you need to be there. This applies even to sickbeds and dentists chairs. It even applies to prisons. Such a sermon was delivered in the state penitentiary. Afterward, a young man forgot himself and prayed, "Bless all those who arent here this time that they may be here next time." That is going a little too far.</p>
<p>In the Church, our purr word is <i>active,</i> and it is of course crucial. But even if we are partially disabled - and we are, most of us, in various ways - even then, if the heart is continually filled with righteous desires, they themselves are transforming. The activity Christ most cares about is within us amidst the bustle. In short, wherever we are can be a pleasant place if Christ approves us there and attends us there.</p>
<p>It is said that a man in Jerusalem was given a job of going daily to a flat roof and looking toward the east to anticipate the Messiah. Asked about it, he said, "Well, the pay isnt much, but the work is steady." We all have that steady job. It was assigned us by the Master - assigned the Saints when they were driven out in midwinter in Missouri. The counsel was, "Seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls" (D&amp;C 101:38). Again, at Winter Quarters, history repeated itself. The Lord said, "If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful" (D&amp;C 136:29). When He said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33), His disciples had almost nothing to cheer about except their relationship with Him and the transcending anticipation of His return.</p>
<h2><b>2. The Joys of the Senses</b></h2>
<p>H. L. Mencken scored religious people as those who live in mortal dread "that someone, somewhere, may be happy" (in "Sententiae," <i>A Mencken Chrestomathy</i> [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949], 624). It is a sharp indictment. It is also one of the superstitions of the irreligious, I suggest, that religious people cannot have fun. We work at it in this church. Well, our religion is not Menckens religion. It is the religion of the glad tidings of the Master. Notice His promised rewards for keeping the Sabbath. He only imposed one condition. He said we should keep the Sabbath "with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance" (D&amp;C 59:15). And then He promised</p>
<p><i>the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . To please the eye and to gladden the heart;</i></p>
<p><i>. . . For food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</i> [D&amp;C 59:3, 1819]</p>
<p>He calls this "the fulness of the earth" (D&amp;C 59:16). He even defines fasting and prayer - fasting ordinarily conjoined with mourning - with rejoicing and prayer (vs. 14).</p>
<p>Further, the Master did not say we would only be happy when we transcend the earth. He said, instead, that this very earth transformed will become heaven. He said that even here we may begin to enjoy that which shall be in full hereafter. At this level, joy and pleasure are not opposed - they are combined.</p>
<p>When Jesus said through John in his epistle, "Love not the world," He meant, "Love not the wickedness of the world" (JST 1 John 2:15).</p>
<p>And when He said to keep "unspotted from the world" (D&amp;C 59:9), it was actually to keep "unspotted from the vices of the world" (JST James 1:27).</p>
<p>He did not say the body is intrinsically evil. Yes, this body can be easily perverted and abused, but He taught that this body is a temple that is a house of light and glory. It can be a Stradivarius violin on which, if we permit Him, He can, as Master Musician, play. I was struck this morning again by a line reflecting Joseph Smith: "Man of himself is an instrument of music" (Joseph Young, "Vocal Music," <i>History of the Organization of the Seventies</i> [Salt Lake City: Joseph E. Massey Restoration Publisher, 1970], 14). Through his modern prophet the Lord has promised that the Spirit will not only illumine our minds but heighten all our senses - sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. What else is a glorious resurrection?</p>
<p>Now the devils game is to convince you that he is the king of enjoyment. He advertises shortcuts to ecstasy. "Buy into my game," he says, "and the rewards are all here in glittering neon." But, as usual, he lies. He lies big time. In wrath over his own permanent unembodiment, he either taunts us that the body is nothing - and we seek then a kind of negative spirituality - or he tells us the opposite. The body is everything. And you know where that leads. In abject misery of his own making, he seeks to make all men miserable like himself. He is a double-crosser. He keeps no promises. He not only doesnt deliver, he enslaves. He is the saddest of sadists in the universe.</p>
<p>The Savior, in contrast, will never, ever tamper with your freedom, except if you cooperate with Him to increase it. I count 75 times in the Doctrine and Covenants where He pleads with us to "ask, seek." But He will not force. He has everything to give that the devil claims to have, and He has never broken a promise yet.</p>
<h2><b>3. The Joys of Contemplation and Anticipation</b></h2>
<p>Jesus said in modern revelation, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge" (D&amp;C 42:61). Is there joy in learning, however difficult? Yes. All learning can be fulfilling and helpful: skills, talents, problem solving, earning a living. But below that is an undergirding quest. Listen to what He most wants us to learn. The Lord finished His sentence with "that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things - that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal" (D&amp;C 42:61). Peaceable things? That which bringeth joy? The context of this is the temple. Temples are where all levels of joy combine, where togetherness with Him and with others is hallowed and sealed into families. The temple is a magnifying glass of such learning and of such lasting love. There you see your mission in life in the framework of eternity. There mind and spirit and senses are reawakened to the grandeur of the earth and of its joys. The temple is our most direct access to His mighty intelligence. And I trust the line that He is "more intelligent than they all" (Abraham 3:19). This is the glory of God. This is light and truth.</p>
<p>In the house of the Lord, it is as if we are in the Panama Canal. The Spirit comes up, as it were, under us and lifts us, and when we leave, we leave on a different ocean. But at the same time we are there, the vessel itself is healed and repaired and recommissioned and floats away prepared for the batterings and the confusions of daily life. The Prophet said, speaking of these heavenly, peace-giving truths:</p>
<p><i>I can taste the principles of eternal life, and so can you. . . . You say honey is sweet, and so do I. I can also taste the spirit of eternal life. I know that it is good; and when I tell you of these things which were given me by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, you are bound to receive them as sweet, and rejoice more and more.</i>[<i>HC</i> 6:312]</p>
<p>In the original Joseph Smith said, "<i>I</i> rejoice more and more." Which did he mean? I, or you? He meant both, because in that process, we have been told, "both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;C 50:22). The temple and those within it are a perpetual prayer for the fulness of the Holy Ghost. And that means ultimately the fulness of joy (see D&amp;C 109:15, 7980).</p>
<p>But is there such a thing as the fulness of joy? Well, there is a portrait of how these dimensions came together once in this world. Near a temple in a land called Bountiful, Jesus, who had been rejected and crucified and abandoned, now found Himself in the midst of a multitude of men, women, and children who had survived a three-hour earthquake. (By the way, this is one of the most authentic notes in the Book of Mormon. It says "three hours." But then there is another phrase: "and it was said by some that the time was greater" [3 Nephi 8:19]. Ive been in a 20-second earthquake, and I was already in serious trouble.)</p>
<p>As we are told in 3 Nephi 17, the people of Bountiful not only listened but received Him for whom He is. He could not do many mighty works at home, but in His new home He healed the crippled and the wounded and perhaps those who had other kinds of afflictions. All of them fell to their knees and in prayer poured out gratitude. The Book of Mormon says the Spirit taught them what they should pray. They had been commanded, as we have, to pray to the Father in the name of Christ. But now they prayed to Him, calling Him their Lord and their God.</p>
<p>And the Lord said, almost apologetically, in His prayer, "Father, . . . they pray unto me because I am with them" (3 Nephi 19:22). In how many ways with them! He prayed that they would be one with Him, as He is with the Father. And now they were.</p>
<p>Does the story end there? Not yet. He had called for their little children. Textbooks say that children have some innate fears, among them the fear of falling, the fear of loud noises, the identification with the terror and screams of others. Dont you think little children after a three-hour earthquake would be clinging to their parents, bewildered, and shyly recoiling from strangers?</p>
<p>But He was no stranger. All of the children were brought forward and were completely comfortable in His presence. He then said, "Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full" (3 Nephi 17:20). This is the only place in scripture that I know of where He spoke of His own fulness of joy. When He had said these words, He wept. And with exquisite tenderness He scooped the little children up one by one and blessed them as the parents and grown-up children beheld.</p>
<p>Shortly after a sacramental feast, Christ turned from His own prayers to see them all - men, women, and children - kneeling, whitened and lightened and transformed. In the record we are told that what they saw and felt defied words. But they tried. They said, "No one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father" (3 Nephi 17:17). He bade them arise, but they did not because they were overcome. The power of that experience lasted in the memories of their children and their childrens children for 200 years.</p>
<p>The resurrected Jesus Christ was the fulfillment in their presence of His own prophecy to us. "Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy" (D&amp;C 93:33). The joy of the Lord became their strength, as it can become ours.</p>
<p>My Quaker great-grandmother was named Rachel. Joseph Smith taught her. She had to reverse her notions from the past that there was little or no room for singing or dancing or playfulness or humor or for turning fasting into feasting. But on the theme of cultivating the inner light, she found in the fulness of the gospel confirmation of her earlier faith. Widowed nine days after the birth of her only son, she toiled her way through nagging poverty. She forced the bishop to take her tithing when there were six pans on the floor catching the leaks from the roof. And, brothers and sisters, in this day of growth in the Church, just count Chile and the Philippines only and you have a million Latter-day Saints who are living pretty much with a tin roof and a dirt floor and the 23rd Psalm on the wall.</p>
<p>Rachel served for 35 years as a Relief Society president. Even while hurting, she helped those who hurt more. During those years she was completely deaf and therefore more sensitive to the Light or its absence in those around her. She could not believe the promise made her by a patriarch that as Rachel of old she would have a worthy posterity. She had only one son. Her own portraits and the fading photographs are a study of clear eyes and serenity - she had the face of a saint. Last night we attended the 100th family reunion of her posterity. There are 700, and they are all of them in the world and of the world of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this Light of the Spirit cannot be faked. All of the theater lights and stages and camera trickery and Photoshop manipulation may convince the unaware that artificial light has the same effect. It does not. Artificial light ends with the flipping of a switch. It is merely a backhanded tribute to Light. Christ is the Life and the Light - the Light that lightens hearts through thick and thin.</p>
<p>So I sum this up with two quotations again from Brother Brigham:</p>
<p><i>There is not a man or woman on this earth, whose peace is made with God, and who are associated with holy beings, and seeking after holy principles, but their countenances are lit up with a lamp of divine cheerfulness.</i> [Sermon by Brigham Young, 1 October 1854, Historians Office Report of Speeches, LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City]</p>
<p>And again, elsewhere:</p>
<p><i>I say, if you want to enjoy exquisitely, become a Latter-day Saint, and then live the doctrine of Jesus Christ. The man or woman who will do this will enjoy and endure most; and if they will be humble and faithful they will enjoy the glory and the excellency of the power of God, and be prepared to live with Gods and with angels. </i>[<i>JD</i> 18:247]</p>
<p>We are approaching the season to be jolly. But it can be more - it can be the season to be joyful. Let us come and adore Him. Let us sing the "songs of everlasting joy" (D&amp;C 109:39, 133:33).</p>
<p>My testimony is this: I have been around a while, and I have read and spent at least half of my life looking at alternative religions and outlooks. And I suppose also I am a bit of an expert on the alternative death styles that are out there. One of the strongest arguments ever imposed upon me against this religion is that it is too good to be true. My testimony to you is, it is good and true and beautiful. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesnt begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I cant help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.
I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.
Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!
Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.
What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I dont know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naive sometimes about life. I cant remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:
Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.
I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so m</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Today is January 8, 2008, and the beginning of a new semester at Brigham Young University. I always look forward to the start of a new year with great anticipation, wondering what the days will bring as the year unfolds. I do know that this beautiful campus will be filled with the excitement and activity that always occur when you are here. Each day can provide experiences that can make your time at BYU the means to achieving your goals and the righteous desires of your hearts.
Each of you has taken a different pathway that has resulted in your attending Brigham Young University. You have come from all over the world and represent many different nations and cultures. For some of you, it is your first time at BYU. For others, this semester is a continuation of your schooling at this institution. I believe that the Lord has, in His loving and caring way, opened the door for you to enter this university. The Lord has told you that He will open doors to bless your lives if you remember Him. In Revelation 3:8 we read, "Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."
It is now your opportunity to immerse yourself in the BYU experience and take advantage of all that is available for you in learning things spiritual and temporal, serving and caring, and enhancing your testimonies of the teachings of the Savior, whose birth we have just celebrated. The Lord has stated that He will continue to open doors for you if you remember Him and keep His commandments.
Brigham Young once said, "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the worlds work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University," Improvement Era, vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920], 831). I especially am drawn to the last part of his definition: "the power to appreciate life."
When my husband and I were first married, he was an undergraduate student with a goal of attending medical school, and I was teaching sixth grade. His classes, part-time work, and studies obviously took most of his time. My obligations with work and spending evenings doing all that was necessary to fulfill my teaching responsibilities also took many hours to complete. Once we included our Church callings, we didnt have much time together during the week. I found that I was always looking forward to Friday evenings, when not only would things become more relaxed but we could have some time together as well as a little social life during the weekends. I always seemed to have the "thank goodness its Friday" mentality. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays I was always looking forward to the weekends; thus I was not really enjoying the weekdays. I was happy on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays and a little depressed on the weekdays.
However, one day something o</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What I will say to you today will only have meaning as you make room in your heart for the Spirit. You surely have many things on your mind as you come to this devotional. Our time together will quickly pass. You probably will not remember much of what was said. As the Spirit prompts you with a feeling or thought to attach to your life, please dont let it pass you by.
Our message today is simple: God wants you to find and keep joy in this world and in the world to come. You have been specially endowed with a celestial nature that is to grow into a fullness of joy. That thought can get lost too easily in todays world.
These are turbulent times. There is not much of good report on the six oclock world news these days. The former prophets practically wrote the six oclock world news for you in prophecies. They are signs of our time. The kingdom of God on earth and the kingdom of the adversary are on a collision course of great proportions. You can hardly be blamed for putting on your headphones and turning up your MP3 players to block out the realities around you. However, God has a work for you to do! Within that work - and because of it - you are promised great joy.
You are principle players in this great contest between good and evil. How we pray for you that you will be heavily armed with the standard of truth and righteousness! In the circle of the General Authorities, we frequently comment among ourselves that you are the best prepared of any former generation. You pray more; you study the scriptures more; you are more obedient to the commandments of God. You have a great destiny ahead of you. Although this will become more important to you as life moves on, how great the need is now to develop yourself into the peaceable followers of Christ. How much this world, your future family, and the people around you need the strength of your righteous influence and your joyful countenance.
So lets discuss today how to obtain lasting joy in your life.
On June 24 of this year, Laurel and I will have been married for 44 years. Over these years we have found some very helpful tools in working toward a joyful life, even during the challenging times. We share our experiences with you, hoping that you will think on these experiences and, where appropriate, apply them to yourselves.
From our experience, developing joy brings emotional rewards of inner peace and the healing of pains that often can beset you. Lets see if we can understand how this works doctrinally.
Undergirding the gospel of Jesus Christ is the concept of eternal and permanent happiness. Joseph Smith stated the doctrine in very few words:
Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. [Teachings, 25556]</span>
