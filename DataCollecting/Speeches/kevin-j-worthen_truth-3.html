  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Each year Oxford Dictionaries selects a word of the year - "a word, or expression, that . . . is judged to reflect the . . . mood . . . of that particular year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significance." Past selections include &lt;i&gt;unfriend&lt;/i&gt; in 2009 and &lt;i&gt;selfie&lt;/i&gt; in 2013. In 2015 the word of the year was not a word but a pictograph: the "face with tears of joy" emoji.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Recently, Oxford Dictionaries announced that the word of the year for 2016 is &lt;i&gt;post-truth,&lt;/i&gt; a word they define as "an adjective . . . denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Dictionaries, explained the selection: "Fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment, &lt;i&gt;post-truth&lt;/i&gt; as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time. . . . I wouldnt be surprised if &lt;i&gt;post-truth&lt;/i&gt; becomes one of the defining words of our time."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Reflecting this view, several commentators have recently asserted that we live in a post-truth world, or a world in which truth "has become unimportant or irrelevant."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

It is hard to know with certainty whether truth is really less important than it has been in the past. But it is clear that because we live in a digital age, in which there is so much information and there are so many different contending views of what is accurate, some people find that new information confounds and confuses rather than clarifies and enlightens. Modernizing the plight of the thirsty Ancient Mariner, who proclaimed, "Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink,"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; many today lament, "Data, data, everywhere, and not a thought to think."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Living in a post-truth world in which there is more information available than there is time to process it presents particular challenges. Many do not know how to determine the accuracy or the truthfulness of new information. Some deal with the matter by looking for reinforcement of their own preexisting, and sometimes ill-informed, notions, limiting their pursuit of truth to only those sources that support their views. Stuck in an echo chamber of their own making, they stunt their ability to learn truth by sealing themselves off from any meaningful dialogue with any who may have different viewpoints. A manifestation of this is the increasing polarization in American politics.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Others go to the opposite extreme, finding any piece of information that disrupts their prior views as sufficient reason to throw aside, without further inquiry, truths that have provided sure guidance to them and others in the past. These individuals, to use the words of the apostle Paul, are "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; This tendency sometimes manifests itself as a crisis of faith - triggered by the receipt of pieces of information, true or not, that do not coincide with previously held views.

While there are many causes for political polarization and crises of faith, one common feature is that they are often a partial result of living in a post-truth world in which truth seems so difficult to discern that many may wonder whether it is worth the effort - or even possible at all.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Existence and Importance of Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My message to you today is that truth does exist, it does matter, and it can be discerned. A major part of your purpose here at BYU is to enhance your knowledge of the truth and your ability to discern it. In fact, a major part of our purpose in this mortal existence is to enhance and refine our ability to discern, apply, and ultimately internalize truth.

Scriptures reveal that one of the defining characteristics of Christ - and one source of His supreme power - is that He is full of truth.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; His knowledge of all truth and His adherence to those principles gives Him all power. Indeed, He has internalized truth so well that He rightly proclaimed that He is "the truth."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; He further declared that if we come to know the truth in its fullest sense, the truth will make us free&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; - free to realize our full potential as sons and daughters of God and "joint-heirs with Christ."&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; One of our hymns thus correctly asserts that truth is "the brightest prize To which mortals or Gods can aspire."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

To give us hope that we can eventually realize this almost incomprehensible goal of being full of truth, the scriptures make clear that Christ "received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness."&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

Thus it is both important and possible for us to be able to discern, apply, and internalize truth, despite the fact that we may be living in a post-truth world. And one of the major purposes of your education here is to progress in that manner.

The BYU mission statement indicates that "students at BYU should receive a broad university education." One of the principal ways we do that is through our general education requirements. Because of those requirements, most of you are familiar with this part of our mission and mission statement. However, we too often skip over the introductory phrase to that charge. BYU students are to receive a broad university education, the mission statement says, "because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth."&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; That statement implies at least three things: (1) that there is such a thing as truth, (2) that its acquisition is possible, and (3) that facilitating its pursuit is one of the purposes of this university.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Definition of Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
But all this begs the question that Pontius Pilate put to the Savior: "What is truth?"&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; We could spend well more than several devotionals pursuing that question in depth. Indeed, there are courses on this and other campuses dedicated to that very question,&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; and philosophers have for centuries debated both the nature and the existence of truth without coming to any definite consensus. While Christ did not answer Pilates question directly, in modern revelation He has provided both testimony that truth exists and a general definition of what it encompasses.

In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord declared, "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob echoed the same theme, observing that truth includes "things as they really are, and . . . things as they really will be."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

That simple definition is more profound than it may at first appear. For example, because it defines things as they &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; are, truth is not dependent on popular opinion or the assent of experts. It is, to use the scriptural phrase, "independent in that sphere in which God has placed it."&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

President Spencer W. Kimball explained it this way:

&lt;i&gt;The earth is spherical. If all the . . . people in the world think it flat, they are in error. That is an absolute truth, and all the arguing in the world will not change it. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;God, our Heavenly Father, . . . lives. That is an absolute truth. All . . . the children of men on the earth might be ignorant of him and his attributes and his powers, but he still lives. All the people on the earth might deny him and disbelieve, but he lives in spite of them. They may have their own opinions, but he still lives, and his form, powers, and attributes do not change according to mens opinions. In short, opinion alone has no power in the matter of an absolute truth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

Truth is not only independent; it is completely comprehensive. It encompasses all knowledge and all accurate information - in all worlds that have ever been or ever will be. As B. H. Roberts put it:

&lt;i&gt;When you say that truth is that which is, that which has been, and that which is to be in future, . . . you make it "the sum of existence": You will include the past, present, and future of all existences - their "sum"; and this is truth: The "sum" of existences, past, present, and yet to be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

Given that there are worlds - or existences - "without number,"&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; knowledge of all aspects of each of their pasts, presents, and futures is vast and comprehensive.

Thus, in one sense, as Elder Roberts noted, "The absolute truth as . . . set forth [in section 93] is beyond the grasp of the finite mind."&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; However, it is incumbent upon us to learn as much of the truth as we can as part of our pathway in becoming like Him who embodies all truth.

Brigham Young put it this way: "[Our] religion . . . prompts [us] to search diligently after knowledge. There is no other people in existence more eager to see, hear, learn, and understand truth."&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; And this is where your current experience at BYU comes in.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Role of Study and Faith in Pursuing Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
BYU is an educational institution. It is a place dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge. In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord provided a list of things we should learn. You should be familiar with it. It sounds much like the broad general education that we provide to all our students as part of our mission statement. We are to

&lt;i&gt;be instructed . . . in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God . . .&lt;/i&gt; ;

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;

That description seems to cover pretty much everything from geology to geography and from astronomy to anthropology. But note especially these three subjects in the middle of the list: "things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass." While this is not a verbatim repetition of the definition of truth in section 93, it is so close that the two are surely connected. That it is embedded in the middle of this more specific list of subjects suggests that truth is found in each of these other subjects and, correspondingly, that when we study any of these topics, we are engaged in "the pursuit of all truth," as our mission statement challenges us to do. Thus all courses at this university - indeed, all we do at this university - should be focused on the pursuit of truth.

But the pursuit of truth requires that we be able to recognize it and that we be able to distinguish information that is true from that which is not. How are we to do that, especially in a world that is increasingly post-truth? The familiar scriptural injunction that we "seek learning . . . by study and also by faith"&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; is fully applicable in this regard.

The role of study in the identification and acquisition of truth is more well-known and widespread in universities. That is likely the primary means by which you will come to develop the skills and capacity to discern and apply truth in the subjects you are studying. You will hopefully develop your capacity to think clearly and rationally about the matters put before you. That is how most students at most colleges spend most of their time, and that is how most of you will spend most of your time here.

But at BYU we are committed to the proposition that faith can also play a critical role in the recognition and acquisition of truth. Alma distinguished faith from perfect knowledge. He noted that "faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things" but instead is a "hope for things which are not seen, which are true."&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; But this hope is not a self-created wish. Faith is, as described in Hebrews, "the substance [or the assurance&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; Thus faith seems to be a God-granted way of discerning truth before one has perfect knowledge of the matter. Faith is an extra-rational means of discerning truth - through revelation.

Elder Dallin H. Oaks has observed that "revelation . . . occurs when a scientist, an inventor, an artist or great leader receives flashes of enlightenment from a loving God for the benefit of His children."&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; I suspect that many of you have had the experience of being stuck on a problem for hours or days or even weeks or months and then having the solution come to you in a flash. I certainly have. I can best account for those sudden insights by reference to Joseph Smiths description of the revelatory process, in which he said, "You feel pure intelligence flowing into you, [giving] you sudden strokes of ideas."&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; Such revelatory experiences are greatly enhanced, as the Prophet Joseph taught, by the exercise and enhancement of our faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;

The fact that faith is a lesser-known means of discerning truth should not obscure the reality that it is, in the long run, more reliable than mere rational argument, which depends on the experience and limited reasoning abilities of imperfect, mortal beings. It is, after all, "by the power of the Holy Ghost" that we "may know the truth of all things."&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, the most important truths can be learned only by revelation based on faith. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell explained, "Gods plan . . . is not something to be deduced by logic alone, nor is human experience deep enough or long enough to inform us adequately. It requires revelation from God."&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/god-will-yet-reveal?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

While study and faith are two different tools in the process of discerning and acquiring truth, the two are interconnected in that process. For example, faith can be the initial impetus for productive study. Faith in a perfect God whose word does not fail and who created worlds governed by eternal laws that do not change&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; gives us an assurance that the often difficult, and sometimes tedious and frustrating, work of acquiring truth by study is an endeavor worth pursuing. If we truly had no belief or hope that there are ultimate answers to our questions, we would be less likely to engage in a deep, meaningful search for the answers. Faith in God can provide the hope, and - in its more advanced stages - even the certainty, that we are seeking for something that can be found.

Similarly, study is often a prerequisite for the revelatory experience that characterizes learning by faith. As President Spencer W. Kimball once observed, "Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence."&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Elder Oaks explained that "revelation in a particular discipline or skill is most likely to come to one who has paid the price of learning all that has previously been revealed [on that subject]."&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;

Discerning truth by study and by faith is not an easy process. You should not expect that if you study enough and have enough faith that you will be able to complete the process before you graduate, either from this university or even this mortal existence. In a post-truth environment - indeed, in any mortal environment - challenges will come and questions will arise to which we dont have ready answers. How do we know in those situations what is truth?

Let me provide four suggestions that I believe are specific applications of the "by study and also by faith" paradigm I have described. These are four things that may help you better distinguish truth from falsehood and productively deal with the uncertainty inherent in the truth-seeking process.

&lt;b&gt;First&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; when you receive new information, consider the source. Some sources are more reliable than others. In the digital age, everyone has a platform. That has some upside, as it allows voices that were previously unheard to participate in the conversation that is part of the pursuit of truth. At the same time, it allows almost anyone to claim almost anything without the same fact-checking filter that has existed for many mainstream sources in the past. If the information comes from a source with which you are not familiar, both the source and the information might require more in-depth scrutiny. At one level, we all know the assertion "it is on the Internet, so it must be true" is a false statement. But too many act as if it is true.

On the flip side, there are sources of information that have a long track record of reliability and veracity. Peer-reviewed texts and articles are usually more likely to be trusted for that very reason. That is why the educational process relies so heavily upon them.

More important, the scriptures are always reliable and are always true. They therefore serve as a measuring stick for other information. That is one reason they are called "standard works." The teachings of modern prophets are similarly reliable, particularly if they are repeated over a period of time.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Second&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; consider the context in which the information arose and is presented. A statement may be accurately reported but still be untrue because it is taken out of context. The story is told of a candidate for election to the local school board who urged voters not to support his opponent because witnesses accurately reported that she had said that the first thing she would do would be to burn down the school. What the candidate failed to reveal is that his opponent made the statement forty years earlier when she was unprepared for an assignment in her second-grade class. Context does matter.

In that regard, I urge you to evaluate new information in light of the entire plan of salvation - one guiding truth that provides accurate context for all aspects of our lives. Evaluating new information in light of the plan of salvation is helpful both because it helps determine the veracity of the information and because it helps determine how important the information is.

&lt;b&gt;Third&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; be patient, both with yourself and with the process. It is important to understand and remember that one purpose of our mortal experience is to learn to operate by faith - to discern truth without perfect knowledge. Thus, in this life there will never be ready answers to all our questions, despite what modern technology may cause us to think. As Elder M. Russell Ballard observed, "James did not say, If any of you lack wisdom, let him Google!"&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; Instead, God created an entire earthly experience to allow us to develop our ability to recognize and apply truth through trial and error so that we could increase our ability to act by faith.

Furthermore, there are likely eternal truths that we simply cannot comprehend in our current mortal and finite condition. And without all truth, we cannot answer all questions. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell once observed, sometimes "we cant make it all add up because clearly we do not have all the numbers."&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;

So dont be distressed if you dont find all the answers immediately. The pursuit of truth is a lifetime and likely eternal pursuit. In the meantime, hold on to what you know to be true, as Elder Jeffrey R. Holland and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf have both implored us to do.&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Fourth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; and most important, if you want to understand truth, draw closer to Him who is the source of all truth and light, who declared Himself - even Jesus Christ - to be "the way, the truth, and the life."&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; Every single point I have made - the existence of truth, the definition of truth, the importance of truth, and the role of study and faith in pursuing the truth - rises or falls with Jesus Christ. If you have doubts about Him, that is where you need to begin the process.

President Joseph Fielding Smith once observed:

&lt;i&gt;The greatest truth&lt;/i&gt; [is] &lt;i&gt;. . . that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, who came into this world to die that men might live. . . . It is far more important to know that . . . than it is to know all that can be obtained in secular education.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;

I close by bearing my witness that Jesus Christ lives. He is the Truth. He and only He can lead you to all truth. He is anxious to bless you not only in your educational endeavors here but in all your doings in all places at all times. If you will focus on Him in your pursuit of truth, you will succeed here and beyond. This I witness in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.

39. As Elder D. Todd Christofferson noted:

&lt;i&gt;With the keys of the kingdom, the Lords servants can identify both truth and falsehood and once again authoritatively state, "Thus saith the Lord." Regrettably, some resent the Church because they want to define their own truth, but in reality it is a surpassing blessing to receive a "knowledge of things as they [truly] are, and as they were, and as they are to come" [D&amp;amp;C 93:24] insofar as the Lord wills to reveal it. The Church safeguards and publishes Gods revelations - the canon of scripture.&lt;/i&gt; ["&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Why the Church&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2015]

			<p>Each year Oxford Dictionaries selects a word of the year - "a word, or expression, that . . . is judged to reflect the . . . mood . . . of that particular year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significance." Past selections include <i>unfriend</i> in 2009 and <i>selfie</i> in 2013. In 2015 the word of the year was not a word but a pictograph: the "face with tears of joy" emoji.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Recently, Oxford Dictionaries announced that the word of the year for 2016 is <i>post-truth,</i> a word they define as "an adjective . . . denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief."<sup>2</sup> Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Dictionaries, explained the selection: "Fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment, <i>post-truth</i> as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time. . . . I wouldnt be surprised if <i>post-truth</i> becomes one of the defining words of our time."<sup>3</sup> Reflecting this view, several commentators have recently asserted that we live in a post-truth world, or a world in which truth "has become unimportant or irrelevant."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>It is hard to know with certainty whether truth is really less important than it has been in the past. But it is clear that because we live in a digital age, in which there is so much information and there are so many different contending views of what is accurate, some people find that new information confounds and confuses rather than clarifies and enlightens. Modernizing the plight of the thirsty Ancient Mariner, who proclaimed, "Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink,"<sup>5</sup> many today lament, "Data, data, everywhere, and not a thought to think."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Living in a post-truth world in which there is more information available than there is time to process it presents particular challenges. Many do not know how to determine the accuracy or the truthfulness of new information. Some deal with the matter by looking for reinforcement of their own preexisting, and sometimes ill-informed, notions, limiting their pursuit of truth to only those sources that support their views. Stuck in an echo chamber of their own making, they stunt their ability to learn truth by sealing themselves off from any meaningful dialogue with any who may have different viewpoints. A manifestation of this is the increasing polarization in American politics.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Others go to the opposite extreme, finding any piece of information that disrupts their prior views as sufficient reason to throw aside, without further inquiry, truths that have provided sure guidance to them and others in the past. These individuals, to use the words of the apostle Paul, are "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men."<sup>8</sup> This tendency sometimes manifests itself as a crisis of faith - triggered by the receipt of pieces of information, true or not, that do not coincide with previously held views.</p>
<p>While there are many causes for political polarization and crises of faith, one common feature is that they are often a partial result of living in a post-truth world in which truth seems so difficult to discern that many may wonder whether it is worth the effort - or even possible at all.</p>
<h2><b>The Existence and Importance of Truth</b></h2>
<p>My message to you today is that truth does exist, it does matter, and it can be discerned. A major part of your purpose here at BYU is to enhance your knowledge of the truth and your ability to discern it. In fact, a major part of our purpose in this mortal existence is to enhance and refine our ability to discern, apply, and ultimately internalize truth.</p>
<p>Scriptures reveal that one of the defining characteristics of Christ - and one source of His supreme power - is that He is full of truth.<sup>9</sup> His knowledge of all truth and His adherence to those principles gives Him all power. Indeed, He has internalized truth so well that He rightly proclaimed that He is "the truth."<sup>10</sup> He further declared that if we come to know the truth in its fullest sense, the truth will make us free<sup>11</sup> - free to realize our full potential as sons and daughters of God and "joint-heirs with Christ."<sup>12</sup> One of our hymns thus correctly asserts that truth is "the brightest prize To which mortals or Gods can aspire."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>To give us hope that we can eventually realize this almost incomprehensible goal of being full of truth, the scriptures make clear that Christ "received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Thus it is both important and possible for us to be able to discern, apply, and internalize truth, despite the fact that we may be living in a post-truth world. And one of the major purposes of your education here is to progress in that manner.</p>
<p>The BYU mission statement indicates that "students at BYU should receive a broad university education." One of the principal ways we do that is through our general education requirements. Because of those requirements, most of you are familiar with this part of our mission and mission statement. However, we too often skip over the introductory phrase to that charge. BYU students are to receive a broad university education, the mission statement says, "because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth."<sup>15</sup> That statement implies at least three things: (1) that there is such a thing as truth, (2) that its acquisition is possible, and (3) that facilitating its pursuit is one of the purposes of this university.</p>
<h2><b>The Definition of Truth</b></h2>
<p>But all this begs the question that Pontius Pilate put to the Savior: "What is truth?"<sup>16</sup> We could spend well more than several devotionals pursuing that question in depth. Indeed, there are courses on this and other campuses dedicated to that very question,<sup>17</sup> and philosophers have for centuries debated both the nature and the existence of truth without coming to any definite consensus. While Christ did not answer Pilates question directly, in modern revelation He has provided both testimony that truth exists and a general definition of what it encompasses.</p>
<p>In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord declared, "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<sup>18</sup> The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob echoed the same theme, observing that truth includes "things as they really are, and . . . things as they really will be."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>That simple definition is more profound than it may at first appear. For example, because it defines things as they <i>really</i> are, truth is not dependent on popular opinion or the assent of experts. It is, to use the scriptural phrase, "independent in that sphere in which God has placed it."<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball explained it this way:</p>
<p><i>The earth is spherical. If all the . . . people in the world think it flat, they are in error. That is an absolute truth, and all the arguing in the world will not change it. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>God, our Heavenly Father, . . . lives. That is an absolute truth. All . . . the children of men on the earth might be ignorant of him and his attributes and his powers, but he still lives. All the people on the earth might deny him and disbelieve, but he lives in spite of them. They may have their own opinions, but he still lives, and his form, powers, and attributes do not change according to mens opinions. In short, opinion alone has no power in the matter of an absolute truth.</i><sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Truth is not only independent; it is completely comprehensive. It encompasses all knowledge and all accurate information - in all worlds that have ever been or ever will be. As B. H. Roberts put it:</p>
<p><i>When you say that truth is that which is, that which has been, and that which is to be in future, . . . you make it "the sum of existence": You will include the past, present, and future of all existences - their "sum"; and this is truth: The "sum" of existences, past, present, and yet to be.</i><sup>22</sup></p>
<p>Given that there are worlds - or existences - "without number,"<sup>23</sup> knowledge of all aspects of each of their pasts, presents, and futures is vast and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Thus, in one sense, as Elder Roberts noted, "The absolute truth as . . . set forth [in section 93] is beyond the grasp of the finite mind."<sup>24</sup> However, it is incumbent upon us to learn as much of the truth as we can as part of our pathway in becoming like Him who embodies all truth.</p>
<p>Brigham Young put it this way: "[Our] religion . . . prompts [us] to search diligently after knowledge. There is no other people in existence more eager to see, hear, learn, and understand truth."<sup>25</sup> And this is where your current experience at BYU comes in.</p>
<h2><b>The Role of Study and Faith in Pursuing Truth</b></h2>
<p>BYU is an educational institution. It is a place dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge. In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord provided a list of things we should learn. You should be familiar with it. It sounds much like the broad general education that we provide to all our students as part of our mission statement. We are to</p>
<p><i>be instructed . . . in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God . . .</i> ;</p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><sup>26</sup></p>
<p>That description seems to cover pretty much everything from geology to geography and from astronomy to anthropology. But note especially these three subjects in the middle of the list: "things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass." While this is not a verbatim repetition of the definition of truth in section 93, it is so close that the two are surely connected. That it is embedded in the middle of this more specific list of subjects suggests that truth is found in each of these other subjects and, correspondingly, that when we study any of these topics, we are engaged in "the pursuit of all truth," as our mission statement challenges us to do. Thus all courses at this university - indeed, all we do at this university - should be focused on the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>But the pursuit of truth requires that we be able to recognize it and that we be able to distinguish information that is true from that which is not. How are we to do that, especially in a world that is increasingly post-truth? The familiar scriptural injunction that we "seek learning . . . by study and also by faith"<sup>27</sup> is fully applicable in this regard.</p>
<p>The role of study in the identification and acquisition of truth is more well-known and widespread in universities. That is likely the primary means by which you will come to develop the skills and capacity to discern and apply truth in the subjects you are studying. You will hopefully develop your capacity to think clearly and rationally about the matters put before you. That is how most students at most colleges spend most of their time, and that is how most of you will spend most of your time here.</p>
<p>But at BYU we are committed to the proposition that faith can also play a critical role in the recognition and acquisition of truth. Alma distinguished faith from perfect knowledge. He noted that "faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things" but instead is a "hope for things which are not seen, which are true."<sup>28</sup> But this hope is not a self-created wish. Faith is, as described in Hebrews, "the substance [or the assurance<sup>29</sup>] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<sup>30</sup> Thus faith seems to be a God-granted way of discerning truth before one has perfect knowledge of the matter. Faith is an extra-rational means of discerning truth - through revelation.</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has observed that "revelation . . . occurs when a scientist, an inventor, an artist or great leader receives flashes of enlightenment from a loving God for the benefit of His children."<sup>31</sup> I suspect that many of you have had the experience of being stuck on a problem for hours or days or even weeks or months and then having the solution come to you in a flash. I certainly have. I can best account for those sudden insights by reference to Joseph Smiths description of the revelatory process, in which he said, "You feel pure intelligence flowing into you, [giving] you sudden strokes of ideas."<sup>32</sup> Such revelatory experiences are greatly enhanced, as the Prophet Joseph taught, by the exercise and enhancement of our faith in Jesus Christ.<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>The fact that faith is a lesser-known means of discerning truth should not obscure the reality that it is, in the long run, more reliable than mere rational argument, which depends on the experience and limited reasoning abilities of imperfect, mortal beings. It is, after all, "by the power of the Holy Ghost" that we "may know the truth of all things."<sup>34</sup> Indeed, the most important truths can be learned only by revelation based on faith. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell explained, "Gods plan . . . is not something to be deduced by logic alone, nor is human experience deep enough or long enough to inform us adequately. It requires revelation from God."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/god-will-yet-reveal?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>While study and faith are two different tools in the process of discerning and acquiring truth, the two are interconnected in that process. For example, faith can be the initial impetus for productive study. Faith in a perfect God whose word does not fail and who created worlds governed by eternal laws that do not change<sup>36</sup> gives us an assurance that the often difficult, and sometimes tedious and frustrating, work of acquiring truth by study is an endeavor worth pursuing. If we truly had no belief or hope that there are ultimate answers to our questions, we would be less likely to engage in a deep, meaningful search for the answers. Faith in God can provide the hope, and - in its more advanced stages - even the certainty, that we are seeking for something that can be found.</p>
<p>Similarly, study is often a prerequisite for the revelatory experience that characterizes learning by faith. As President Spencer W. Kimball once observed, "Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>37</sup></a> Elder Oaks explained that "revelation in a particular discipline or skill is most likely to come to one who has paid the price of learning all that has previously been revealed [on that subject]."<sup>38</sup></p>
<p>Discerning truth by study and by faith is not an easy process. You should not expect that if you study enough and have enough faith that you will be able to complete the process before you graduate, either from this university or even this mortal existence. In a post-truth environment - indeed, in any mortal environment - challenges will come and questions will arise to which we dont have ready answers. How do we know in those situations what is truth?</p>
<p>Let me provide four suggestions that I believe are specific applications of the "by study and also by faith" paradigm I have described. These are four things that may help you better distinguish truth from falsehood and productively deal with the uncertainty inherent in the truth-seeking process.</p>
<p><b>First</b><b>,</b> when you receive new information, consider the source. Some sources are more reliable than others. In the digital age, everyone has a platform. That has some upside, as it allows voices that were previously unheard to participate in the conversation that is part of the pursuit of truth. At the same time, it allows almost anyone to claim almost anything without the same fact-checking filter that has existed for many mainstream sources in the past. If the information comes from a source with which you are not familiar, both the source and the information might require more in-depth scrutiny. At one level, we all know the assertion "it is on the Internet, so it must be true" is a false statement. But too many act as if it is true.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are sources of information that have a long track record of reliability and veracity. Peer-reviewed texts and articles are usually more likely to be trusted for that very reason. That is why the educational process relies so heavily upon them.</p>
<p>More important, the scriptures are always reliable and are always true. They therefore serve as a measuring stick for other information. That is one reason they are called "standard works." The teachings of modern prophets are similarly reliable, particularly if they are repeated over a period of time.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Second</b><b>,</b> consider the context in which the information arose and is presented. A statement may be accurately reported but still be untrue because it is taken out of context. The story is told of a candidate for election to the local school board who urged voters not to support his opponent because witnesses accurately reported that she had said that the first thing she would do would be to burn down the school. What the candidate failed to reveal is that his opponent made the statement forty years earlier when she was unprepared for an assignment in her second-grade class. Context does matter.</p>
<p>In that regard, I urge you to evaluate new information in light of the entire plan of salvation - one guiding truth that provides accurate context for all aspects of our lives. Evaluating new information in light of the plan of salvation is helpful both because it helps determine the veracity of the information and because it helps determine how important the information is.</p>
<p><b>Third</b><b>,</b> be patient, both with yourself and with the process. It is important to understand and remember that one purpose of our mortal experience is to learn to operate by faith - to discern truth without perfect knowledge. Thus, in this life there will never be ready answers to all our questions, despite what modern technology may cause us to think. As Elder M. Russell Ballard observed, "James did not say, If any of you lack wisdom, let him Google!"<sup>40</sup> Instead, God created an entire earthly experience to allow us to develop our ability to recognize and apply truth through trial and error so that we could increase our ability to act by faith.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are likely eternal truths that we simply cannot comprehend in our current mortal and finite condition. And without all truth, we cannot answer all questions. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell once observed, sometimes "we cant make it all add up because clearly we do not have all the numbers."<sup>41</sup></p>
<p>So dont be distressed if you dont find all the answers immediately. The pursuit of truth is a lifetime and likely eternal pursuit. In the meantime, hold on to what you know to be true, as Elder Jeffrey R. Holland and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf have both implored us to do.<sup>42</sup></p>
<p><b>Fourth</b><b>,</b> and most important, if you want to understand truth, draw closer to Him who is the source of all truth and light, who declared Himself - even Jesus Christ - to be "the way, the truth, and the life."<sup>43</sup> Every single point I have made - the existence of truth, the definition of truth, the importance of truth, and the role of study and faith in pursuing the truth - rises or falls with Jesus Christ. If you have doubts about Him, that is where you need to begin the process.</p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith once observed:</p>
<p><i>The greatest truth</i> [is] <i>. . . that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, who came into this world to die that men might live. . . . It is far more important to know that . . . than it is to know all that can be obtained in secular education.</i><sup>44</sup></p>
<p>I close by bearing my witness that Jesus Christ lives. He is the Truth. He and only He can lead you to all truth. He is anxious to bless you not only in your educational endeavors here but in all your doings in all places at all times. If you will focus on Him in your pursuit of truth, you will succeed here and beyond. This I witness in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p><i>With the keys of the kingdom, the Lords servants can identify both truth and falsehood and once again authoritatively state, "Thus saith the Lord." Regrettably, some resent the Church because they want to define their own truth, but in reality it is a surpassing blessing to receive a "knowledge of things as they [truly] are, and as they were, and as they are to come" [D&amp;C 93:24] insofar as the Lord wills to reveal it. The Church safeguards and publishes Gods revelations - the canon of scripture.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why the Church</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2015]</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters! I am grateful to see many friends and family and wonderful students. It humbles me to be with you today.
I believe in truth in advertising: what I share today is far more important than I am capable of expressing. Those of us who teach the gospel soon realize that we are just not good enough. But I know that with the Lords help I can do what needs to be done. I pray for that help for all of us as we spend the next few minutes together.
There is power in truth. The Savior taught that "the truth shall make you free."1 In theory, we have all come to BYU in search of truth. I realize that there are many other possible motives for being here, from career preparation to the supposed mystery of marriage preparation. Much of my career has been spent helping my students learn how to date, court, and marry well.
I was tempted to speak on those issues today but decided to speak on another issue I am passionate about. Thirty minutes will not allow a full exploration of this topic, but it will allow an introduction. I will be teaching a four-day version of this speech at Campus Education Week this August for any who are gluttons for punishment and would like more detail.
Courage in the Quest for Truth
We live in a world filled with differing views, opinions, and philosophies. Never have we had more access to information. Our task is to decide what is true and what is false. On some issues, that decision is not so crucial, such as whether Cafe Rio or Costa Vida is best. Other issues are fraught with immense - at times even eternal - consequences.
For example, my dear friend Daniel Judd and I chaired the committee that created the new Eternal Family cornerstone class in Religious Education. I dont have to work hard to convince my single students of the importance of knowing how to select an eternal companion. Understanding the vast consequences of that decision, most students are strongly motivated to understand truth. In fact, many students are terrified that they dont know and cant know that truth.
A 2002 BYU study asked students how they would know they had found the one they wanted to marry. Most gave a few possible answers, but a full 11 percent simply answered, "I dont know," with men being almost twice as likely to express that fear.2
In humility, it is wise for us all to acknowledge our imperfection in determining truth. None of us have all the answers, least of all me. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained, "It seems to be part of our nature as human beings to make assumptions about people, politics, and piety based on our incomplete and often misleading experience."3
An example I often use in my Eternal Family class is of a husband who observed his wife turning back and forth in front of a mirror. Since her birthday was not far off, he asked what she would like for her birthday. St</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you - graduates, parents, and other supporters - thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbruck, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they dont. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests - like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I wish to express my gratitude to the trustees, administration, faculty, and students of Brigham Young University for the invitation to be with you for this great celebration of the academic achievements of the men and women who are graduating today. I also want to thank you for the tremendous honor that you are conferring on me. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the graduates and to the families whose love and support enabled these men and women to achieve what they have achieved in these years of study. Finally, I just want to say what a tremendous honor it is for me to be receiving this degree along with President Cecil O. Samuelson, whose distinguished leadership of this university I admire and whose contributions to intellectual life and to human values beyond Brigham Young University are so exemplary.
There are traditions of thought that propose a radical separation of faith and reason. They ask, "What does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?" Although notable Christians from Tertullian to Kierkegaard have associated themselves with such traditions, they have not gained ascendancy in the larger Christian community. The mainstream of Christianity, while fully cognizant of what theologians describe as "the noetic effects of sin" - that is, the way in which our fallenness not only weakens the human will but also darkens the intellect - proclaims the harmony of faith and reason and the need for faith to seek and be informed by understanding.
In the words of Pope John Paul II, the philosophy professor who became pope and who has now been canonized as a saint, "Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth."1
The two wings are not separate paths to truth. Just as both wings are necessary and must be in working order for the dove or the eagle to fly, so too both faith and reason are necessary for the intellectual and spiritual quest and for the intellectual and spiritual life. And faith and reason do not work separately or independently of one another, but rather they work together, in harmony. Faith and reason mutually entail and require each other. Neither can truly exist - faith cannot truly be faith, reason cannot truly be reason - wholly apart from one another.
This helps to explain why Christianity has built not only majestic cathedrals in which to worship but also great universities in which to study and learn. The very idea of a university is religious and, indeed, Christian in its inspiration, conception, and fundamental content. The greatest modern reflection on the idea of a university - what a university is, what it does, why it does it, how it should do it - is the work of an eminent Christian thinker, John Henry Cardinal Newman, the great nineteenth-century British man of letters.2
And today more than ever we need universities that are true to Newmans vision, universities in which faith and reason work in harmony, accomplish</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have to tell you how much I love working and living in a college town, where I get to know so many wonderful students. When our youngest, Rob, was about five, we were out shopping, and I bumped into a bunch of students, as frequently happens. It was great because he looked up at me kind of wide-eyed and said, "Mom, every place we go people know you. Are you famous?"
Of course I said, "Yes."
I may not be famous, but I am blessed to work with so many fantastic colleagues and friends and to have so many great students; they inspire me in many ways. Many of my students are here today. My Chemistry 285 class actually meets every day at noon, so today they get a short, one-day reprieve from amino acids and proteins, but they should be suspicious that I am going to work in something from todays devotional in tomorrows quiz. So pay attention.
As a brand-new chemistry graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, my faculty advisor, Dr. Charlie Perrin, gave me the relatively easy task of replicating the experiments of a student who was leaving our lab. The results from that project were going to be published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, which is a top journal in my field.
When I finished the experiments, my results were the opposite of the original findings. I repeated the experiments several times, but each time the results didnt match. I began to panic. My failure to replicate felt like evidence that I was terrible in the lab. I took my results to my advisor, and he was surprised. He suggested a series of modified molecules on which I could repeat similar experiments.
I worked hard. I purified materials. I read literature techniques. I did a mountain of experiments. I talked about ideas with my favorite friend in chemistry, Julie, and at the end of a long day I would come home and worry out loud to my husband, Dan. In the end, what we learned is that the original results were inaccurate. Eventually we published a paper in the same journal, retracting the first claims and proposing a new conclusion. In fact, the title changed from the original "Symmetries of Hydrogen Bonds" to "Asymmetry of Hydrogen Bonds."
Charlie Perrin became one of my heroes. He valued learning truth over protecting his reputation. Every time I entered his office with new ideas or new results, he welcomed them. He felt that even an unexpected or "wrong" result taught us something.
I learned so much from this experience - including that ice cream soothes my soul after a long day - that has shaped me over the years. I learned that experiments help us gain truth, that we can become stronger from struggles, that meaningful results require a lot of time and effort, and that working with others is essential. I believe that life experiences, which we might also call experiments, are meant to enable us to grow and become Christlike.
Gain Truth</span>
