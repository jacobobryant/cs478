  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear brothers and sisters, what a delight it is to be with you today. To feel your spirit and the greatness of this school is uplifting and edifying.

My wife and I connect in a very personal way to this institution of higher education. No, we never studied here, but our daughter received a master’s degree here. As a proud parent, I am not only sharing with you that she graduated summa cum laude, but it is much more impressive and joyful for us as parents that she gave birth to our twin grandsons at the Utah Valley Hospital during the same year. Therefore, my wife and I love Provo. We love BYU. We love to be with you today.

By the way, all of our children and grandchildren live in Europe. They try to follow the long-standing counsel by the First Presidency to remain in their homelands, working to build the Church in their native countries. Great blessings will come personally to them and to the Church collectively as they heed this counsel. I commend the many of you who will strengthen wards and stakes throughout the world as you return to your countries after receiving such an excellent education here at BYU.

In 2003 a hundred years of powered flight is being celebrated. The Wright brothers invented the airplane in 1903. Having been a pilot since 1959, only 56 years after the Wright brothers, I selected this historic event to make a connection for my talk today.

An ancient Greek myth tells the story of Daedalus and Icarus, who made wings from feathers and wax. Over the centuries, many, including Leonardo da Vinci, tried to invent flying machines. In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers made a hot-air balloon rise above Paris. At the end of the 19th century, Otto Lilienthal, a German who flew his own gliders, was killed during a test flight in Berlin.

On December 17, 1903, a dream of mankind was fulfilled as Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first controlled, powered flight. The distance was about 120 feet, or 37 meters—about half the length of a B-747 jumbo jet—and the duration was about 12 seconds. That’s shorter than the time it takes me to climb the stairs leading up to the 747 cockpit.

Few really believed that it would ever be possible for man to fly like a bird. A commissioner of the U.S. Office of Patents is reputed to have said: “Everything that can be invented has been invented.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

In Paris on November 5, 1908, Wilbur Wright said to the Aéro-Club de France:

&lt;i&gt;The desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their gruelling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space, at full speed, above all obstacles, on the infinite highway of the air. . . . I confess that, in 1901, I said to my brother Orville that men would not fly for fifty years. . . . I have ever since distrusted myself and have refrained from all prediction.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Wilbur and Orville had parents who encouraged education, religion, and family values. Both brothers had their share of serious illnesses. They went through difficult times of trouble, perplexity, and even despair, wondering if they would ever succeed. They tried different vocations as printers, bicycle repairmen, bicycle manufacturers, and, eventually, aircraft inventors. Throughout their lives whenever they picked a project to work on, they were focused and worked as a team.

Looking at the geography of their activities, a thought came to me—more on the light side. Just to go from their home in Dayton, Ohio, to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers had to first take a train, then a steamship, then another train, and finally one more voyage by boat. The trip of about 700 miles took the Wrights nine days. No wonder they decided to invent the airplane.

I know they had their share of frustration and discouragement over “too little time,” “too much to do,” and “too little success,” but stumbling blocks became stepping-stones for them.

As you might have similar feelings at times, let me assure you that you all have reasons to think beyond the horizon of provinciality because you are a royal generation. Even angels are cheering you on; they know of the great divine potential that lies within you.

Taking a view from a higher perspective, what Orville and Wilbur Wright brought about was actually only a small step for man compared to the leap for humanity and mankind you are able to bring to pass during your lifetime as you “enter to learn” and “go forth to serve.”

In 1918, on the 11th day of the 11th month at the 11th hour—a time at which we stand this very day and hour as well—the world community was hoping that with the end of World War I, the end had come to all wars. Since the infamous attack of 9/11/2001, as we read the newspaper, watch television, or listen to the news, we almost constantly hear of “wars and rumors of wars” and realize that “the whole earth [is] in commotion, and men’s hearts shall fail them” (D&amp;amp;C 45:26). But let us remember that God declared, “See that ye be not troubled, for all I have told you must come to pass; but the end is not yet. . . . Behold I speak for mine elect’s sake” (JS—M 1:23, 29).

At BYU you have favorable circumstances and inspired leaders who will help you to be honest with others and yourselves and to “be of good cheer” (John 16:33), to have visions, dreams, and always hope—even for your football team, which is presently on a losing streak.

Sometimes it is difficult to see what good will come out of your efforts and where the road you are on will lead to. You might even feel like Paul on his way to Rome. In the book of Acts we read that Paul was taken as a prisoner to the capital city of the world’s number-one military power. It looked bleak for the Apostle Paul. En route to Rome the ship he was on was caught in a &lt;i&gt;perfect storm,&lt;/i&gt; one not made in Hollywood but in the Mediterranean Sea. All their lives were endangered. We read, “And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away” (Acts 27:20).

How did Paul handle this hopeless situation? Amidst all this commotion, he stood up and said, “Be of good cheer: . . . For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not” (Acts 27:22–24). Paul then gave concise instructions that appeared at the moment far removed from a logical problem-solving process. Among other things, he told them to lighten the ship, and they did so by throwing things they cherished overboard. Then “they committed themselves unto the sea . . . , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore” (Acts 27:40).

Fortunately the guards who were prepared to kill Paul believed his words and followed his counsel. The scripture reports, “And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land” (Acts 27:44).

There will be times in your lives when you will not know the quick answers for your circumstances. Rely then on the word of God. Your Father in Heaven will always teach you to fear not, but to be of good cheer, to lighten your ship of clutter and focus on the spiritual matters, to commit yourselves to the covenants you made, and to put your sail of righteousness into the wind and head courageously toward the land of your eternal future.

The Wright brothers committed themselves to do what no one else had ever done before—something numerous highly recognized people had declared was impossible. The Wright brothers took time to do their homework. They were humble and smart enough to appreciate and learn about the work of others who went before. And they tackled the problem line upon line, precept upon precept. They realized that there were three main requirements for a practical flying machine:

&lt;b&gt;First,&lt;/b&gt; the pilot had to be able to &lt;i&gt;control the aircraft.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Second,&lt;/b&gt; the wings had to &lt;i&gt;produce lift.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Third,&lt;/b&gt; it had to be &lt;i&gt;powered by an engine&lt;/i&gt; to stay aloft.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

They had their goals defined and worked diligently on them one day at a time. Leonardo da Vinci said, “He turns not back who is bound to a star.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Similar principles and requirements apply to your own journey through life and toward the destination of eternal life. Divine principles have to be learned and lived as you prepare to rise up on the wings of eagles.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First: You Have to Learn to Control Yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It isn’t until you come to a spiritual understanding of who you are that you can begin to take control of yourself. As you learn to control yourself, you will get control of your life. If you want to move the world, you first have to move yourself.

President Spencer W. Kimball often quoted an unknown author:

&lt;i&gt;The greatest battle of life is fought out within the silent chambers of the soul. A victory on the inside of a man’s heart is worth a hundred conquests on the battlefields of life. To be master of yourself is the best guarantee that you will be master of the situation. Know thyself. The crown of character is self-control.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

Be responsive to the counsel of the prophets, seers, and revelators who will help you to reach true self-mastery. Be responsive to the promptings of the Spirit. The Spirit will influence your conscience and help you to refine yourself by working on the little tasks of self-control—like controlling your thoughts, words, and actions, which leads to self-control of your whole self, of mind, body, and spirit. Remember, &lt;i&gt;anger&lt;/i&gt; is only one letter short of &lt;i&gt;danger.&lt;/i&gt;

Your choices are the mirror of your self-control. They will lead you to your eternal destination if they are made with divine direction and control. Stay morally clean. Keep a clean mind and heart. Your thoughts will determine your actions. Control your thoughts. Don’t submit yourself to temptation. Aristotle said, “For what it lies in our power to do, it lies in our power not to do.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Control wisely and select carefully what you will invite via a mouse click or remote control into your home, your dormitory, or your office. Select reading material, movies, TV shows, and any other form of entertainment that bring good, uplifting thoughts rather than unwholesome desires.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second: Your Attitude Will Determine Your Lift and Altitude&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Dictionaries describe &lt;i&gt;lift&lt;/i&gt; something like the following: “to carry or direct from a lower to a higher position; the power or force available for raising to a new level or altitude; a force acting in an upward direction, opposing the pull of gravity.”

The Psalmist sets the goals even higher: “Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul” (Psalm 25:1), and, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help” (Psalm 121:1). He invites you to fly with the eagles, not to scratch with the chickens.

Lifting your eyes toward the God of heaven is a process cultivating your own very personal spirituality. It is a desire to live in harmony with the Father; the Son, our Savior; and the Holy Ghost. It is also your ability to be truly “submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father” (Mosiah 3:19).

With the right attitude—which, incidentally, is also needed to produce sufficient lift for an airplane—you will be able to effectively communicate with your Heavenly Father, and not to just say your prayers. You will be able to say prayers that will go beyond the ceiling of the room—prayers not filled with trite repetitions or spoken without thinking but filled with your deep yearning to be one with your Father in Heaven.

Prayer, if given in faith, is acceptable to God at all times. If you ever feel you cannot pray, that is the time when you definitely need to pray. Nephi taught in plainness: “For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit [of God] which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit . . . teacheth him that he must not pray” (2 Nephi 32:8).

President Harold B. Lee taught: “The sincere prayer of the righteous heart opens to any individual the door to divine wisdom and strength in that for which he righteously seeks.”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Obedience assures us an answer to our prayers. We read in the New Testament: “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight” (1 John 3:22).

The Prophet Joseph Smith learned in a revelation given to him in Kirtland in 1831: “He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh” (D&amp;amp;C 46:30).

In order to lift, enhance, and cultivate your relationship with God as His spiritual children, you have the unique opportunity to converse with the supreme source of wisdom and compassion in the universe.

Daily, simple but sincere and mighty prayers will help you to lift your lives onto a higher spiritual altitude. In your prayers you praise God, give thanks to Him, confess weaknesses, petition needs, and express deep devotion to your Heavenly Father. As you do this, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, you perform a spiritual effort that leads to increased inspiration, revelation, and righteousness—not self-righteousness—and brings the brightness of heaven into your lives.

This brings back memories from my professional life as an airline captain: departing from a dark and rainy airport, climbing through thick and threatening winter clouds, and then, suddenly, breaking through the cloud tops and steeply gaining altitude into the bright sunshine and into the endless blue sky, feeling free, safe, and home at last. But this beautiful feeling reflects only the smallest part of what you can experience through your daily prayers.

A word of caution: In aerodynamics, gravity and drag work in &lt;i&gt;opposition&lt;/i&gt; to lift. This same important principle has been an integral part of the plan of salvation from the beginning. As Lehi explained: “For it must needs be, that there is an &lt;i&gt;opposition&lt;/i&gt; in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11; emphasis added). And King Benjamin warned, “For the natural man is an enemy to God . . . &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit” (Mosiah 3:19; emphasis added).

This leads us to God’s great gift to His children: agency.

Lehi taught this most important doctrine to his children. He said:

&lt;i&gt;The Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the . . . power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 2:16, 27]

You have agency and you are free to choose. But there is actually no &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; agency. Agency has its price. You have to pay the consequences of your choices.

Like gravity or drag in aerodynamics, agency will collect its fee through accountability—just like the foolish man who chose to step out of the window of a high building had to accept the consequences of his choice. He had to learn the hard way that “it ain’t the free fall that hurts; it’s the sudden stop.”

Agency is a spiritual matter. Without awareness of alternatives, you could not choose. Agency is so important in your lives that you not only &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; choose obedience or rebellion but you &lt;i&gt;must.&lt;/i&gt; During this life you cannot remain on neutral ground—you cannot abstain from either receiving or rejecting the light from God.

Human agency was purchased with the price of Christ’s suffering. The power of Christ’s Atonement overcomes the effect of sin on the condition of wholehearted repentance. Through and by the Savior’s universal and infinite Atonement, all have been redeemed from the Fall and have become free forever to act for themselves (see 2 Nephi 2:26).

By learning to use the gift of agency to make right decisions you will increase your spiritual lift and altitude. You will also quickly recognize one other prime source of spiritual truth: the written word of God.

Lifting your eyes toward heaven requires an attitude directed upward. With this positive attitude toward life comes the desire to &lt;i&gt;feast&lt;/i&gt; “upon the word of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:20)—not to just occasionally nibble on the scriptures or the words of the prophets.

“Feasting” includes searching, pondering, asking, praying, and living the word of God. Read the holy scriptures as if they were written for you—for they are. Nephi said, “For behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do” (2 Nephi 32:3).

One powerful scripture in the New Testament, James 1:5, initiated a wonderful process that led to the restoration of all things. May I ask you to take time to feast upon the word of God? It is available 24/7 but should not be treated like a fast-food service. Jesus asked listeners to go home and ponder what He had taught them (see 3 Nephi 17:3). This pondering, feasting, and meditating will help you “know to what source [you] may look for a remission of [your] sins” (2 Nephi 25:26).

Prayers and feasting upon the word of God are two elements of a heavenward attitude that will also enhance your work ethic and your willingness to serve and lift others. It will help you to carry Church responsibilities with the willingness to magnify your callings without trying to magnify yourself. With this divine attitude you will be more concerned about &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;you serve rather than &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt; you serve. King Benjamin taught, “I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). And we do this by “lift[ing] up the hands which hang down” (Hebrews 12:12).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third: You Need to Find and Trust the True Source of Divine Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Wright brothers needed engine power to make the airplane fly. Without true engine power this machine would have remained static. There would have been no lift, no forward motion to enable flight—no airplane.

You have an all-encompassing true source of power available to help you reach the purpose of your creation. This is the power of God, exercising a subtle and loving influence in the lives of His children, lifting you and keeping you aloft. It is manifested as the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.

The Latin source of the word &lt;i&gt;comforter—com fortis—&lt;/i&gt;means “together strong.” As the Holy Ghost visits your own spirit, you become stronger than you are by yourself. When you receive the Holy Ghost, you receive strength, power, peace, and comfort.

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:

&lt;i&gt;There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

Parley P. Pratt stated that the Holy Ghost

&lt;i&gt;inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is . . . marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

President Marion G. Romney gave us encouragement:

&lt;i&gt;You can make every decision in your life correctly if you can learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This you can do if you will discipline yourself to yield your own feelings to the promptings of the Spirit. Study your problems and prayerfully make a decision. Then take that decision and say to him, in a simple, honest supplication, “Father, I want to make the right decision. I want to do the right thing. This is what I think I should do; let me know if it is the right course.” Doing this, you can get the burning in your bosom, if your decision is right. . . . When you learn to walk by the Spirit, you never need to make a mistake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

The Prophet Joseph Smith talked about the promptings of the Spirit as “sudden strokes of ideas.”&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

The Holy Ghost will make you independent. You need to learn many things during your time at BYU, but if you will learn how to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, all other needful things will fall in place. Through your personal righteousness the Spirit of God will guide you to learn to control yourself, to enhance your attitude, to increase your spiritual altitude, and to find and trust the true source of divine power.

To stay one more time within the metaphor of flying an aircraft, many things are required to make an airplane fly and fly safely, but the most important thing, as I used to call it, is the “wind beneath your wings.” Without it, there is no lift, no climb, no flight into the wild blue yonder or to faraway, beautiful destinations.

The Holy Ghost will be the wind beneath your wings, placing in your hearts the firm conviction of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and His place in the eternal plan of God, your Eternal Father. Through the Holy Ghost you will know &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; place in this plan and &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; divine eternal destination. You will be converted to the Lord, His gospel, and His Church, and you will never fall away. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>My dear brothers and sisters, what a delight it is to be with you today. To feel your spirit and the greatness of this school is uplifting and edifying.</p>
<p>My wife and I connect in a very personal way to this institution of higher education. No, we never studied here, but our daughter received a master’s degree here. As a proud parent, I am not only sharing with you that she graduated summa cum laude, but it is much more impressive and joyful for us as parents that she gave birth to our twin grandsons at the Utah Valley Hospital during the same year. Therefore, my wife and I love Provo. We love BYU. We love to be with you today.</p>
<p>By the way, all of our children and grandchildren live in Europe. They try to follow the long-standing counsel by the First Presidency to remain in their homelands, working to build the Church in their native countries. Great blessings will come personally to them and to the Church collectively as they heed this counsel. I commend the many of you who will strengthen wards and stakes throughout the world as you return to your countries after receiving such an excellent education here at BYU.</p>
<p>In 2003 a hundred years of powered flight is being celebrated. The Wright brothers invented the airplane in 1903. Having been a pilot since 1959, only 56 years after the Wright brothers, I selected this historic event to make a connection for my talk today.</p>
<p>An ancient Greek myth tells the story of Daedalus and Icarus, who made wings from feathers and wax. Over the centuries, many, including Leonardo da Vinci, tried to invent flying machines. In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers made a hot-air balloon rise above Paris. At the end of the 19th century, Otto Lilienthal, a German who flew his own gliders, was killed during a test flight in Berlin.</p>
<p>On December 17, 1903, a dream of mankind was fulfilled as Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first controlled, powered flight. The distance was about 120 feet, or 37 meters—about half the length of a B-747 jumbo jet—and the duration was about 12 seconds. That’s shorter than the time it takes me to climb the stairs leading up to the 747 cockpit.</p>
<p>Few really believed that it would ever be possible for man to fly like a bird. A commissioner of the U.S. Office of Patents is reputed to have said: “Everything that can be invented has been invented.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In Paris on November 5, 1908, Wilbur Wright said to the Aéro-Club de France:</p>
<p><i>The desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their gruelling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space, at full speed, above all obstacles, on the infinite highway of the air. . . . I confess that, in 1901, I said to my brother Orville that men would not fly for fifty years. . . . I have ever since distrusted myself and have refrained from all prediction.</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Wilbur and Orville had parents who encouraged education, religion, and family values. Both brothers had their share of serious illnesses. They went through difficult times of trouble, perplexity, and even despair, wondering if they would ever succeed. They tried different vocations as printers, bicycle repairmen, bicycle manufacturers, and, eventually, aircraft inventors. Throughout their lives whenever they picked a project to work on, they were focused and worked as a team.</p>
<p>Looking at the geography of their activities, a thought came to me—more on the light side. Just to go from their home in Dayton, Ohio, to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers had to first take a train, then a steamship, then another train, and finally one more voyage by boat. The trip of about 700 miles took the Wrights nine days. No wonder they decided to invent the airplane.</p>
<p>I know they had their share of frustration and discouragement over “too little time,” “too much to do,” and “too little success,” but stumbling blocks became stepping-stones for them.</p>
<p>As you might have similar feelings at times, let me assure you that you all have reasons to think beyond the horizon of provinciality because you are a royal generation. Even angels are cheering you on; they know of the great divine potential that lies within you.</p>
<p>Taking a view from a higher perspective, what Orville and Wilbur Wright brought about was actually only a small step for man compared to the leap for humanity and mankind you are able to bring to pass during your lifetime as you “enter to learn” and “go forth to serve.”</p>
<p>In 1918, on the 11th day of the 11th month at the 11th hour—a time at which we stand this very day and hour as well—the world community was hoping that with the end of World War I, the end had come to all wars. Since the infamous attack of 9/11/2001, as we read the newspaper, watch television, or listen to the news, we almost constantly hear of “wars and rumors of wars” and realize that “the whole earth [is] in commotion, and men’s hearts shall fail them” (D&amp;C 45:26). But let us remember that God declared, “See that ye be not troubled, for all I have told you must come to pass; but the end is not yet. . . . Behold I speak for mine elect’s sake” (JS—M 1:23, 29).</p>
<p>At BYU you have favorable circumstances and inspired leaders who will help you to be honest with others and yourselves and to “be of good cheer” (John 16:33), to have visions, dreams, and always hope—even for your football team, which is presently on a losing streak.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to see what good will come out of your efforts and where the road you are on will lead to. You might even feel like Paul on his way to Rome. In the book of Acts we read that Paul was taken as a prisoner to the capital city of the world’s number-one military power. It looked bleak for the Apostle Paul. En route to Rome the ship he was on was caught in a <i>perfect storm,</i> one not made in Hollywood but in the Mediterranean Sea. All their lives were endangered. We read, “And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away” (Acts 27:20).</p>
<p>How did Paul handle this hopeless situation? Amidst all this commotion, he stood up and said, “Be of good cheer: . . . For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not” (Acts 27:22–24). Paul then gave concise instructions that appeared at the moment far removed from a logical problem-solving process. Among other things, he told them to lighten the ship, and they did so by throwing things they cherished overboard. Then “they committed themselves unto the sea . . . , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore” (Acts 27:40).</p>
<p>Fortunately the guards who were prepared to kill Paul believed his words and followed his counsel. The scripture reports, “And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land” (Acts 27:44).</p>
<p>There will be times in your lives when you will not know the quick answers for your circumstances. Rely then on the word of God. Your Father in Heaven will always teach you to fear not, but to be of good cheer, to lighten your ship of clutter and focus on the spiritual matters, to commit yourselves to the covenants you made, and to put your sail of righteousness into the wind and head courageously toward the land of your eternal future.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers committed themselves to do what no one else had ever done before—something numerous highly recognized people had declared was impossible. The Wright brothers took time to do their homework. They were humble and smart enough to appreciate and learn about the work of others who went before. And they tackled the problem line upon line, precept upon precept. They realized that there were three main requirements for a practical flying machine:</p>
<p><b>First,</b> the pilot had to be able to <i>control the aircraft.</i></p>
<p><b>Second,</b> the wings had to <i>produce lift.</i></p>
<p><b>Third,</b> it had to be <i>powered by an engine</i> to stay aloft.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>They had their goals defined and worked diligently on them one day at a time. Leonardo da Vinci said, “He turns not back who is bound to a star.”<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Similar principles and requirements apply to your own journey through life and toward the destination of eternal life. Divine principles have to be learned and lived as you prepare to rise up on the wings of eagles.</p>
<h2><b>First: You Have to Learn to Control Yourself</b></h2>
<p>It isn’t until you come to a spiritual understanding of who you are that you can begin to take control of yourself. As you learn to control yourself, you will get control of your life. If you want to move the world, you first have to move yourself.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball often quoted an unknown author:</p>
<p><i>The greatest battle of life is fought out within the silent chambers of the soul. A victory on the inside of a man’s heart is worth a hundred conquests on the battlefields of life. To be master of yourself is the best guarantee that you will be master of the situation. Know thyself. The crown of character is self-control.</i><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Be responsive to the counsel of the prophets, seers, and revelators who will help you to reach true self-mastery. Be responsive to the promptings of the Spirit. The Spirit will influence your conscience and help you to refine yourself by working on the little tasks of self-control—like controlling your thoughts, words, and actions, which leads to self-control of your whole self, of mind, body, and spirit. Remember, <i>anger</i> is only one letter short of <i>danger.</i></p>
<p>Your choices are the mirror of your self-control. They will lead you to your eternal destination if they are made with divine direction and control. Stay morally clean. Keep a clean mind and heart. Your thoughts will determine your actions. Control your thoughts. Don’t submit yourself to temptation. Aristotle said, “For what it lies in our power to do, it lies in our power not to do.”<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Control wisely and select carefully what you will invite via a mouse click or remote control into your home, your dormitory, or your office. Select reading material, movies, TV shows, and any other form of entertainment that bring good, uplifting thoughts rather than unwholesome desires.</p>
<h2><b>Second: Your Attitude Will Determine Your Lift and Altitude</b></h2>
<p>Dictionaries describe <i>lift</i> something like the following: “to carry or direct from a lower to a higher position; the power or force available for raising to a new level or altitude; a force acting in an upward direction, opposing the pull of gravity.”</p>
<p>The Psalmist sets the goals even higher: “Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul” (Psalm 25:1), and, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help” (Psalm 121:1). He invites you to fly with the eagles, not to scratch with the chickens.</p>
<p>Lifting your eyes toward the God of heaven is a process cultivating your own very personal spirituality. It is a desire to live in harmony with the Father; the Son, our Savior; and the Holy Ghost. It is also your ability to be truly “submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father” (Mosiah 3:19).</p>
<p>With the right attitude—which, incidentally, is also needed to produce sufficient lift for an airplane—you will be able to effectively communicate with your Heavenly Father, and not to just say your prayers. You will be able to say prayers that will go beyond the ceiling of the room—prayers not filled with trite repetitions or spoken without thinking but filled with your deep yearning to be one with your Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>Prayer, if given in faith, is acceptable to God at all times. If you ever feel you cannot pray, that is the time when you definitely need to pray. Nephi taught in plainness: “For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit [of God] which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit . . . teacheth him that he must not pray” (2 Nephi 32:8).</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee taught: “The sincere prayer of the righteous heart opens to any individual the door to divine wisdom and strength in that for which he righteously seeks.”<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Obedience assures us an answer to our prayers. We read in the New Testament: “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight” (1 John 3:22).</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith learned in a revelation given to him in Kirtland in 1831: “He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh” (D&amp;C 46:30).</p>
<p>In order to lift, enhance, and cultivate your relationship with God as His spiritual children, you have the unique opportunity to converse with the supreme source of wisdom and compassion in the universe.</p>
<p>Daily, simple but sincere and mighty prayers will help you to lift your lives onto a higher spiritual altitude. In your prayers you praise God, give thanks to Him, confess weaknesses, petition needs, and express deep devotion to your Heavenly Father. As you do this, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, you perform a spiritual effort that leads to increased inspiration, revelation, and righteousness—not self-righteousness—and brings the brightness of heaven into your lives.</p>
<p>This brings back memories from my professional life as an airline captain: departing from a dark and rainy airport, climbing through thick and threatening winter clouds, and then, suddenly, breaking through the cloud tops and steeply gaining altitude into the bright sunshine and into the endless blue sky, feeling free, safe, and home at last. But this beautiful feeling reflects only the smallest part of what you can experience through your daily prayers.</p>
<p>A word of caution: In aerodynamics, gravity and drag work in <i>opposition</i> to lift. This same important principle has been an integral part of the plan of salvation from the beginning. As Lehi explained: “For it must needs be, that there is an <i>opposition</i> in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11; emphasis added). And King Benjamin warned, “For the natural man is an enemy to God . . . <i>unless</i> he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit” (Mosiah 3:19; emphasis added).</p>
<p>This leads us to God’s great gift to His children: agency.</p>
<p>Lehi taught this most important doctrine to his children. He said:</p>
<p><i>The Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the . . . power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i> [2 Nephi 2:16, 27]</p>
<p>You have agency and you are free to choose. But there is actually no <i>free</i> agency. Agency has its price. You have to pay the consequences of your choices.</p>
<p>Like gravity or drag in aerodynamics, agency will collect its fee through accountability—just like the foolish man who chose to step out of the window of a high building had to accept the consequences of his choice. He had to learn the hard way that “it ain’t the free fall that hurts; it’s the sudden stop.”</p>
<p>Agency is a spiritual matter. Without awareness of alternatives, you could not choose. Agency is so important in your lives that you not only <i>can</i> choose obedience or rebellion but you <i>must.</i> During this life you cannot remain on neutral ground—you cannot abstain from either receiving or rejecting the light from God.</p>
<p>Human agency was purchased with the price of Christ’s suffering. The power of Christ’s Atonement overcomes the effect of sin on the condition of wholehearted repentance. Through and by the Savior’s universal and infinite Atonement, all have been redeemed from the Fall and have become free forever to act for themselves (see 2 Nephi 2:26).</p>
<p>By learning to use the gift of agency to make right decisions you will increase your spiritual lift and altitude. You will also quickly recognize one other prime source of spiritual truth: the written word of God.</p>
<p>Lifting your eyes toward heaven requires an attitude directed upward. With this positive attitude toward life comes the desire to <i>feast</i> “upon the word of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:20)—not to just occasionally nibble on the scriptures or the words of the prophets.</p>
<p>“Feasting” includes searching, pondering, asking, praying, and living the word of God. Read the holy scriptures as if they were written for you—for they are. Nephi said, “For behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do” (2 Nephi 32:3).</p>
<p>One powerful scripture in the New Testament, James 1:5, initiated a wonderful process that led to the restoration of all things. May I ask you to take time to feast upon the word of God? It is available 24/7 but should not be treated like a fast-food service. Jesus asked listeners to go home and ponder what He had taught them (see 3 Nephi 17:3). This pondering, feasting, and meditating will help you “know to what source [you] may look for a remission of [your] sins” (2 Nephi 25:26).</p>
<p>Prayers and feasting upon the word of God are two elements of a heavenward attitude that will also enhance your work ethic and your willingness to serve and lift others. It will help you to carry Church responsibilities with the willingness to magnify your callings without trying to magnify yourself. With this divine attitude you will be more concerned about <i>how </i>you serve rather than <i>where</i> you serve. King Benjamin taught, “I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). And we do this by “lift[ing] up the hands which hang down” (Hebrews 12:12).</p>
<h2><b>Third: You Need to Find and Trust the True Source of Divine Power</b></h2>
<p>The Wright brothers needed engine power to make the airplane fly. Without true engine power this machine would have remained static. There would have been no lift, no forward motion to enable flight—no airplane.</p>
<p>You have an all-encompassing true source of power available to help you reach the purpose of your creation. This is the power of God, exercising a subtle and loving influence in the lives of His children, lifting you and keeping you aloft. It is manifested as the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The Latin source of the word <i>comforter—com fortis—</i>means “together strong.” As the Holy Ghost visits your own spirit, you become stronger than you are by yourself. When you receive the Holy Ghost, you receive strength, power, peace, and comfort.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:</p>
<p><i>There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Parley P. Pratt stated that the Holy Ghost</p>
<p><i>inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is . . . marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>President Marion G. Romney gave us encouragement:</p>
<p><i>You can make every decision in your life correctly if you can learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This you can do if you will discipline yourself to yield your own feelings to the promptings of the Spirit. Study your problems and prayerfully make a decision. Then take that decision and say to him, in a simple, honest supplication, “Father, I want to make the right decision. I want to do the right thing. This is what I think I should do; let me know if it is the right course.” Doing this, you can get the burning in your bosom, if your decision is right. . . . When you learn to walk by the Spirit, you never need to make a mistake.</i><sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith talked about the promptings of the Spirit as “sudden strokes of ideas.”<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>The Holy Ghost will make you independent. You need to learn many things during your time at BYU, but if you will learn how to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, all other needful things will fall in place. Through your personal righteousness the Spirit of God will guide you to learn to control yourself, to enhance your attitude, to increase your spiritual altitude, and to find and trust the true source of divine power.</p>
<p>To stay one more time within the metaphor of flying an aircraft, many things are required to make an airplane fly and fly safely, but the most important thing, as I used to call it, is the “wind beneath your wings.” Without it, there is no lift, no climb, no flight into the wild blue yonder or to faraway, beautiful destinations.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost will be the wind beneath your wings, placing in your hearts the firm conviction of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and His place in the eternal plan of God, your Eternal Father. Through the Holy Ghost you will know <i>your</i> place in this plan and <i>your</i> divine eternal destination. You will be converted to the Lord, His gospel, and His Church, and you will never fall away. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of God’s greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a heart’s electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.
When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!
Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.
Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The heart’s valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!
In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.
It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.
In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israel’s new king. As he looked over each of Jesse’s sons, the Lord taught Samuel, “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).
Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had “a beautiful countenance” and that “the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]” (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).
In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. My thanks go to those who provided the music this morning. Their music has helped to bring the Spirit to this meeting. I would hope to speak by that Spirit today.
My late friend Robert J. Matthews, who taught religion here at BYU, used to say, “If I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, you will hear things better than I say them.” I pray that that can happen today.
I thought it appropriate to begin with a little poem written by a young man that I think might illustrate what sometimes may happen in parents’ attempts to change the behavior of their children. He wrote:
My parents told me not to smoke—
I don’t. 
Nor listen to a naughty joke—
I don’t. 
They made it plain I must not wink
At pretty girls, or even think
About intoxicating drink—
I don’t. 
To dance and flirt is very wrong—
I don’t. 
Wild youths chase women, wine and song—
I don’t. 
I kiss no girls, not even one—
I do not know how it is done—
You wouldn’t think I had much fun—
I DON’T. 
[“I Don’t,” Goldendale Sentinel (Klickatat County, Washington), 24 October 1918, 1, gld.stparchive.com/Archive/GLD/GLD10241918P01.php]
Now, you see that this young man’s behavior was changed, but not his attitude. What is needed is a change in attitude as well as behavior. So I pose this question: What causes a change in attitude and behavior?
President Boyd K. Packer stated:
True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. 
The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. . . . That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel. [“Little Children,” Ensign, November 1986, 17]
The purpose of my presentation today is to explore four points of doctrine as found in the scriptures and in the words of the Brethren.
Principle Number 1: Draw upon the Power of the Word Daily
The prophet Mormon wrote:
And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. [Alma 31:5]
When I taught seminary years ago, I wanted to show the youth the power of the word that Alma described. I wanted to show them that if they would make the word of God (as found in the scriptures) a part of their lives, it would change them. I didn’t know exactly how to do that, but I tried this way.
On the first day of class I gave them a blank sheet of paper and s</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.
I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.
I remember a saying that I heard once: “A good laugh a day keeps the blues away.” I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep life’s ups and downs in perspective and balance.
Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: “Hey, anybody got a straw?” Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation—especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that it’s all right, we understand, or we’re here to help.
In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that “a merry heart doeth good like a medicine.” If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, “be of good cheer” (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a res</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesn’t begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I can’t help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.
I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.
Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!
Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.
What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I don’t know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naïve sometimes about life. I can’t remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:
Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.
I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so m</span>
