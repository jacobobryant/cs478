  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My young brothers and sisters, as I contemplate your great future, your wonderful potential, as well as your acute challenges, I am humbled with the responsibility of speaking to you. Being somewhat closer to the eternities than you are, I have chosen to introduce you to concepts that may be new to some of you. I do so in the spirit of the song from &lt;i&gt;Mary Poppins, &lt;/i&gt;“A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.”
&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of Epiphany&lt;/h2&gt;
I wish to emphasize a profoundly significant phenomenon that occurs in life. It is inspiration. I also want to introduce you to the word &lt;i&gt;epiphany.&lt;/i&gt;

In the Christian tradition, epiphany is the twelfth night of Christmas, usually January sixth. It celebrates the revelation of Jesus the Christ to the Gentiles, the magi at Bethlehem. We do not celebrate the day of epiphany, and it is not part of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. However, &lt;i&gt;epiphany &lt;/i&gt;has another meaning: the appearance of or manifestation from God or a supernatural being. It is also described as a phenomenon that occurs with and seems to result in another.

Writer James Joyce used the word &lt;i&gt;epiphany &lt;/i&gt;to designate an event in which the essential nature of something—a person, a situation, an object—was suddenly perceived. It is thus an intuitive grasp of reality achieved in a quick flash of recognition in which something, usually simple and commonplace, is seen in a new light. In our understanding, this can be inspiration.

To be able to perceive by inspiration the common and ordinary things of life in their true meaning is a great blessing. We heard of an example of this from a woman who had just adopted a new baby. In her joy she said, “I now have two hearts.” Mothers seem to have as many hearts as they have children.

Tonight, however, I wish to speak of a few uncommon, remarkable, spiritual events that have occurred throughout history.

The First Presidency recognized that many historical figures and events were inspired by God. They wrote:

&lt;i&gt;The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God’s light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The Hebrew prophets prepared the way for the coming of Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, who should provide salvation for all mankind who believe in the gospel. &lt;/i&gt;[In Spencer J. Palmer, &lt;i&gt;The Expanding Church &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), frontispiece]

Spiritual intuition has its roots in the Garden of Eden. Mother Eve was caught in a dilemma. She could either avoid partaking of the forbidden fruit and stay in the Garden of Eden, or she could partake of the fruit and have a mortal existence, becoming the mother of the human race. After Adam and Eve had achieved mortality, Eve stated:

&lt;i&gt;Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient. &lt;/i&gt;[Moses 5:11]

Interestingly, these personal epiphanies often come to young people. In secular history we read of Joan of Arc, a simple peasant girl who could neither read nor write. She claimed visions from heaven directing her to liberate her oppressed country, France, from the English. At seventeen, she left her home to fulfill those visions. At first people laughed and declared her insane, but in the end they gave her a horse and the escort of a few men to go and see the king.

Young King Charles VII of France lived in a castle in Chinon. The long Hundred Years’ War with the English had impoverished and divided his country. Charles had heard about Joan and decided to test her. He slipped into the ranks of the army and let one of his trusted associates occupy the throne. When Joan came into the room, she barely acknowledged the man on the throne but walked up to Charles and curtseyed to him as the king. That convinced the king, and he gave her command over his twelve thousand troops. At first the French soldiers did not want to obey her, but when they saw that all succeeded who followed her, and no one succeeded who disregarded her, they got into line and looked upon her as their leader.

Clad in a suit of white armor and flying her own standard, Joan of Arc liberated the besieged city of Orleans in 1429 and defeated the English in four other battles. Twice she was wounded, but each time she recovered and went on fighting. Her orders were those of a military genius. She marched into the city of Reims and stood with sword and banner in hand while Charles was crowned king. She fought in the Battle of Paris until the Burgundians, who were allies of the English, captured her at Compiégne and sold her to the English for sixteen thousand francs. She was imprisoned and suffered many insults. She was tried as a witch and a heretic and burned at the stake in 1431, all because she claimed inspiration.

Another example, drawn from sacred history, is the prophet Samuel. As a boy, he had retired to sleep in the temple, where the ark of God was. He heard the voice of the Lord calling, and he ran to Eli and said, “Here am I; for thou calledst me.” Eli assured him that he had not called him and told him to go back to sleep. The Lord called again to Samuel. Samuel arose and again went to Eli and said, “Here am I; for thou didst call me.” Eli again told him, “I called not, my son; lie down again.”

The point I wish to make about this story is in the next verse: “Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him” (l Samuel 3:4–7).

Many of you dear young brothers and sisters do not yet know the Lord, nor is the word of the Lord revealed to you. The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel went to Eli, not recognizing the voice of the Lord. Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child. He instructed Samuel to lie down again, and if the Lord spoke to him another time, he should say, “Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. “And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth” (1 Samuel 3:8–10).

My dear young friends, there is a profound lesson in this: we are to come to know the Lord so that when he speaks to us we can answer, “Speak, for thy servant heareth.” This is one of the greatest blessings in mortality.
&lt;h2&gt;Tuning In to Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
My first radio was a crystal set. It was hard to tune to the frequency of a particular radio station. One had to literally scratch the receiving wire whisker over the top of the rough crystal to find the right pin point, a little valley or peak on the crystal, where the signal was received. Just a millimeter off on one side or the other of that point and you would lose the signal and get scratchy static. Over time, with patience and perseverance, good eyesight, and a steady hand, you could learn to find the signal point on the crystal without too much difficulty.

So it is in learning to attune ourselves to the inspiration from God and tune out the scratchy static. We have to work at being tuned in. Most of us need a long time to become tuned in most of the time. When I was a young General Authority, President Marion G. Romney, who was in his seventies at the time, told us, “I know when I am working under the Spirit and when I am not.” To be able to recognize when one is being guided by the Spirit is a supernal gift.

President Wilford Woodruff had a remarkable experience of being moved upon by the Spirit. He recounted:

&lt;i&gt;When I got back to Winter Quarters from the pioneer journey [1847], President Young said to me, “Brother Woodruff, I want you to take your wife and children and go to Boston and stay there until you can gather every Saint of God in New England and Canada and send them up to Zion.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I did as he told me. It took me two years to gather up everybody, and I brought up the rear with a company (there were about one hundred of them). We arrived at Pittsburgh one day at sundown. We did not want to stay there, so I went to the first steamboat that was going to leave. I saw the captain and engaged passage for us on that steamer. I had only just done so when the spirit said to me, and that, too, very strongly, “Don’t go aboard that steamer, nor your company.” Of course, I went and spoke to the captain, and told him I had made up my mind to wait.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Well, that ship started, and had only got five miles down the river when it took fire, and three hundred persons were burned to death or drowned. If I had not obeyed that spirit, and had gone on that steamer with the rest of the company, you can see what the result would have been.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,&lt;/i&gt;sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 294–95]

Many of us remember &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot; href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-b-brown_god-gardener/&quot;&gt;President Hugh B. Brown telling of a personal epiphany that he had in World War I.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At that time he owned a farm in Canada. One morning he went out to prune a currant bush that had grown all to wood and no longer blossomed or produced currants. So he got his pruning shears and cut it and pruned it and clipped it back until there was nothing left but the stumps.

President Brown said he imagined that if the currant bush could speak, it would say, “How could you do this to me? I was making such wonderful growth. I was almost as big as the shade tree and the fruit tree that are inside the fence, and now you have cut me down.”

President Brown answered, “Look, little currant bush, I am the gardener here, and I know what I want you to be. I didn’t intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to be a currant bush, and some day, little currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, ‘Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to cut me down, for caring enough about me to hurt me. Thank you, Mr. Gardener.’”

President Brown then explained that when World War I came, he was in England in command of a cavalry unit in the Canadian army. He was a field officer and was being considered for promotion to general in the British army. He was ordered to appear one morning in the office of the commanding general of the Canadian forces. His uniform was pressed and his buttons polished and his boots shining. President Brown recalled: “I walked smartly into the office of the general and I saluted him smartly, and he gave me the same kind of salute a senior officer usually gives—a sort of “Get out of the way, worm!” He then advised President Brown that he was not going to be appointed a general even though he had passed examinations and had the seniority and was a good officer.

He was being sent back to Canada to become a training officer and a transport officer. As the general slipped out of the room to answer a telephone, President Brown noticed on the general’s desk his personal history sheet. Across the bottom, in bold block-type letters, was written “THIS MAN IS A MORMON.”

The general came back, dismissed President Brown, and President Brown went away with a broken heart, bitterness in his soul, and a feeling of failure and disappointment. When he got back to his tent, he clenched his fists, shook them at heaven, and said:

&lt;i&gt;“How could you do this to me, God? I have done everything I could to measure up. There is nothing that I could have done—that I should have done—that I haven’t done. How could you do this to me?” I was as bitter as gall.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then I heard a voice, and I recognized the tone of this voice. It was my own voice, and the voice said, “I am the gardener here. I know what I want you to do.” The bitterness went out of my soul, and I fell on my knees by the cot to ask forgiveness for my ungratefulness and my bitterness.&lt;/i&gt;

President Brown would have been the senior military officer in all western Canada, with security and a good income, and he would have had to raise his daughters and two sons in army barracks. He commented that they probably would have married out of the Church and not amounted to anything.

President Brown concluded this remarkable story by saying that when we are overcome with disappointment and heartbreak and defeat, we should remember that

&lt;i&gt;“God is the gardener here. He knows what he wants you to be.” Submit yourselves to his will. Be worthy of his blessings, and you will get his blessings. &lt;/i&gt;[See Hugh B. Brown, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/new-era/1973/01/the-currant-bush?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“The Currant Bush,”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;New Era, &lt;/i&gt;January 1973, pp. 14–15]

I’m sure most of us feel like the currant bush at some time or another, but as we look back on some of the bumps of life, we can see how they have shaped us and helped us to develop.

I have been privileged to live in a time of the greatest accumulation of knowledge in the world’s history. I remember as a boy on the farm when we lit the coal-oil lamps after dark to light the house. Wood was the only source of heat for all of our cooking and warmth. When I was about eight years old I learned to drive a team of horses. That is much more difficult than driving a car. Sometimes one horse will not pull.

You all missed a lot not living in the time of the Model T Fords. If the Model T got hot enough, it would just keep going with spontaneous combustion when you turned off the ignition key. If the hill was too steep for the car to go up frontward, you turned around and backed up because it seemed to have more power in reverse. The first ones had to be hand-cranked in the summer and the winter because they had no starters. The medical doctors fixed a lot of broken arms because the Model T would backfire when men and women tried to start it with the hand crank. Looking back, it doesn’t seem like there was much mechanical inspiration in a Model T Ford. But then, they only cost $290 when mass produced.

You are the beneficiaries of all of the advances in science, medicine, travel, space, technology, communication, agriculture, entertainment, and all the other fields of knowledge God has revealed to mankind. All of this knowledge ought to be used for the blessing of mankind. It permits the work of the Lord to advance. For instance, jet airplanes permit General Authorities, area authorities, and auxiliary leaders to visit stakes all over the world for teaching and training.

I learned at a young age that inspiration can come to any of us. When I was in junior high school, I was taking a difficult class. Most of what was being taught went over my head. Perhaps I was not trying hard enough. The teacher asked me something. I didn’t understand the question, let alone the answer. Right out of nowhere a response came into my mind that I repeated to the teacher. To my surprise, it was the right answer, but I knew it had not come from me.

So how can we recognize inspiration when it comes? Enos stated, “While I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind” (Enos 1:10).

The voice is not necessarily audible. The spirit of revelation comes by divine confirmation. “I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart” (D&amp;amp;C 8:2).

How did the voice of the Lord sound to Elijah the Tishbite? It was not the “strong wind [which] rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks,” nor was it “an earthquake,” nor “a fire.” Elijah described it as a “still small voice” (1 Kings 19:11–12).

It is that inner voice, the Spirit, that has the power to whisper through and pierce all things.

In the words of Helaman,

&lt;i&gt;It was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 5:30]
&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration and the Gift of the Holy Ghost&lt;/h2&gt;
We believe that all righteous people have the potential to receive inspiration from God. The many great masterpieces of music, art, poetry, and other creations of beauty testify to this. Handel’s glorious oratorio &lt;i&gt;Messiah &lt;/i&gt;is proof of this.

Michelangelo’s statues of the Pietà, Moses, and David also testify of this. Surely the poet William Wordsworth was inspired when he wrote “Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood.”

The same is true of the inventors who have been inspired to bring us all of the marvelous inventions of our time.

We believe the Spirit of God can come to all men and women. This is in distinction to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Administrations of the Holy Ghost are limited without receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “there is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost” (&lt;i&gt;Teachings, &lt;/i&gt;p. 199).

Many outside the Church have received revelation from the Holy Ghost, convincing them of the truth of the gospel. It is through this power that sincere investigators after the truth acquire a testimony of the Book of Mormon and the principles of the gospel before baptism.

However, those possessing the gift of the Holy Ghost can come to greater light and testimony. The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, so deeply that no earthly power can separate one from that knowledge. Indeed, not having the gift of the Holy Ghost is somewhat like having a body without a spiritual immune system.

The First Vision of Joseph Smith is the most remarkable epiphany in the history of the world. We are all familiar with the Prophet Joseph’s story. He retired to the Sacred Grove to inquire of the Lord as to which religion was correct. He was seized by a power that completely overcame him and bound his tongue so that he could not speak. He wrote, “Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.”

Then, calling forth all of the spiritual power he had, he asked God to deliver him from this power of darkness.

&lt;i&gt;Just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound.&lt;/i&gt;

Now here is the significant account:

&lt;i&gt;When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—&lt;/i&gt;This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS—H 1:15–17]

In the history of mankind, few indeed have been privileged to see God or hear Him directly. Yet the gifts of the Spirit since the restoration of the gospel have been rich in the Church and exist today among the faithful members of the Church.

My dear young friends, as Samuel was told, for those of you who do not yet know the Lord, to whom the word of the Lord has yet to be revealed, please open your spiritual ears and eyes. Tune your hearts and souls, as I had to do on my old crystal radio. Set your receiver to the exact spot in your soul where the spiritual signals are coming through. In so doing you will be able to perceive the simple, ordinary things of life in a marvelous new light. You will have remarkable spiritual insight.

To do this you will have to pray fervently, with a clean mind and a humble heart. You will need to earnestly try to keep all of the commandments. You will need to be in harmony with the leadership of the Church, from your bishop and stake president to the First Presidency.

If you can learn to hear the whispering of the Spirit and be guided by your spiritual leaders, you will avoid many of the pitfalls and heartaches of the world. You will have a comforting feeling of your great worth as a choice son or daughter of God. To this end I bless you.

Mine is the sure witness that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Of this I testify with all my soul, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My young brothers and sisters, as I contemplate your great future, your wonderful potential, as well as your acute challenges, I am humbled with the responsibility of speaking to you. Being somewhat closer to the eternities than you are, I have chosen to introduce you to concepts that may be new to some of you. I do so in the spirit of the song from <i>Mary Poppins, </i>“A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.”</p>
<h2>The Meaning of Epiphany</h2>
<p>I wish to emphasize a profoundly significant phenomenon that occurs in life. It is inspiration. I also want to introduce you to the word <i>epiphany.</i></p>
<p>In the Christian tradition, epiphany is the twelfth night of Christmas, usually January sixth. It celebrates the revelation of Jesus the Christ to the Gentiles, the magi at Bethlehem. We do not celebrate the day of epiphany, and it is not part of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. However, <i>epiphany </i>has another meaning: the appearance of or manifestation from God or a supernatural being. It is also described as a phenomenon that occurs with and seems to result in another.</p>
<p>Writer James Joyce used the word <i>epiphany </i>to designate an event in which the essential nature of something—a person, a situation, an object—was suddenly perceived. It is thus an intuitive grasp of reality achieved in a quick flash of recognition in which something, usually simple and commonplace, is seen in a new light. In our understanding, this can be inspiration.</p>
<p>To be able to perceive by inspiration the common and ordinary things of life in their true meaning is a great blessing. We heard of an example of this from a woman who had just adopted a new baby. In her joy she said, “I now have two hearts.” Mothers seem to have as many hearts as they have children.</p>
<p>Tonight, however, I wish to speak of a few uncommon, remarkable, spiritual events that have occurred throughout history.</p>
<p>The First Presidency recognized that many historical figures and events were inspired by God. They wrote:</p>
<p><i>The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God’s light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.</i></p>
<p><i>The Hebrew prophets prepared the way for the coming of Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, who should provide salvation for all mankind who believe in the gospel. </i>[In Spencer J. Palmer, <i>The Expanding Church </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), frontispiece]</p>
<p>Spiritual intuition has its roots in the Garden of Eden. Mother Eve was caught in a dilemma. She could either avoid partaking of the forbidden fruit and stay in the Garden of Eden, or she could partake of the fruit and have a mortal existence, becoming the mother of the human race. After Adam and Eve had achieved mortality, Eve stated:</p>
<p><i>Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient. </i>[Moses 5:11]</p>
<p>Interestingly, these personal epiphanies often come to young people. In secular history we read of Joan of Arc, a simple peasant girl who could neither read nor write. She claimed visions from heaven directing her to liberate her oppressed country, France, from the English. At seventeen, she left her home to fulfill those visions. At first people laughed and declared her insane, but in the end they gave her a horse and the escort of a few men to go and see the king.</p>
<p>Young King Charles VII of France lived in a castle in Chinon. The long Hundred Years’ War with the English had impoverished and divided his country. Charles had heard about Joan and decided to test her. He slipped into the ranks of the army and let one of his trusted associates occupy the throne. When Joan came into the room, she barely acknowledged the man on the throne but walked up to Charles and curtseyed to him as the king. That convinced the king, and he gave her command over his twelve thousand troops. At first the French soldiers did not want to obey her, but when they saw that all succeeded who followed her, and no one succeeded who disregarded her, they got into line and looked upon her as their leader.</p>
<p>Clad in a suit of white armor and flying her own standard, Joan of Arc liberated the besieged city of Orleans in 1429 and defeated the English in four other battles. Twice she was wounded, but each time she recovered and went on fighting. Her orders were those of a military genius. She marched into the city of Reims and stood with sword and banner in hand while Charles was crowned king. She fought in the Battle of Paris until the Burgundians, who were allies of the English, captured her at Compiégne and sold her to the English for sixteen thousand francs. She was imprisoned and suffered many insults. She was tried as a witch and a heretic and burned at the stake in 1431, all because she claimed inspiration.</p>
<p>Another example, drawn from sacred history, is the prophet Samuel. As a boy, he had retired to sleep in the temple, where the ark of God was. He heard the voice of the Lord calling, and he ran to Eli and said, “Here am I; for thou calledst me.” Eli assured him that he had not called him and told him to go back to sleep. The Lord called again to Samuel. Samuel arose and again went to Eli and said, “Here am I; for thou didst call me.” Eli again told him, “I called not, my son; lie down again.”</p>
<p>The point I wish to make about this story is in the next verse: “Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him” (l Samuel 3:4–7).</p>
<p>Many of you dear young brothers and sisters do not yet know the Lord, nor is the word of the Lord revealed to you. The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel went to Eli, not recognizing the voice of the Lord. Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child. He instructed Samuel to lie down again, and if the Lord spoke to him another time, he should say, “Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. “And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth” (1 Samuel 3:8–10).</p>
<p>My dear young friends, there is a profound lesson in this: we are to come to know the Lord so that when he speaks to us we can answer, “Speak, for thy servant heareth.” This is one of the greatest blessings in mortality.</p>
<h2>Tuning In to Inspiration</h2>
<p>My first radio was a crystal set. It was hard to tune to the frequency of a particular radio station. One had to literally scratch the receiving wire whisker over the top of the rough crystal to find the right pin point, a little valley or peak on the crystal, where the signal was received. Just a millimeter off on one side or the other of that point and you would lose the signal and get scratchy static. Over time, with patience and perseverance, good eyesight, and a steady hand, you could learn to find the signal point on the crystal without too much difficulty.</p>
<p>So it is in learning to attune ourselves to the inspiration from God and tune out the scratchy static. We have to work at being tuned in. Most of us need a long time to become tuned in most of the time. When I was a young General Authority, President Marion G. Romney, who was in his seventies at the time, told us, “I know when I am working under the Spirit and when I am not.” To be able to recognize when one is being guided by the Spirit is a supernal gift.</p>
<p>President Wilford Woodruff had a remarkable experience of being moved upon by the Spirit. He recounted:</p>
<p><i>When I got back to Winter Quarters from the pioneer journey [1847], President Young said to me, “Brother Woodruff, I want you to take your wife and children and go to Boston and stay there until you can gather every Saint of God in New England and Canada and send them up to Zion.”</i></p>
<p><i>I did as he told me. It took me two years to gather up everybody, and I brought up the rear with a company (there were about one hundred of them). We arrived at Pittsburgh one day at sundown. We did not want to stay there, so I went to the first steamboat that was going to leave. I saw the captain and engaged passage for us on that steamer. I had only just done so when the spirit said to me, and that, too, very strongly, “Don’t go aboard that steamer, nor your company.” Of course, I went and spoke to the captain, and told him I had made up my mind to wait.</i></p>
<p><i>Well, that ship started, and had only got five miles down the river when it took fire, and three hundred persons were burned to death or drowned. If I had not obeyed that spirit, and had gone on that steamer with the rest of the company, you can see what the result would have been.</i> [<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 294–95]</p>
<p>Many of us remember <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-b-brown_god-gardener/">President Hugh B. Brown telling of a personal epiphany that he had in World War I.</a></span> At that time he owned a farm in Canada. One morning he went out to prune a currant bush that had grown all to wood and no longer blossomed or produced currants. So he got his pruning shears and cut it and pruned it and clipped it back until there was nothing left but the stumps.</p>
<p>President Brown said he imagined that if the currant bush could speak, it would say, “How could you do this to me? I was making such wonderful growth. I was almost as big as the shade tree and the fruit tree that are inside the fence, and now you have cut me down.”</p>
<p>President Brown answered, “Look, little currant bush, I am the gardener here, and I know what I want you to be. I didn’t intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to be a currant bush, and some day, little currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, ‘Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to cut me down, for caring enough about me to hurt me. Thank you, Mr. Gardener.’”</p>
<p>President Brown then explained that when World War I came, he was in England in command of a cavalry unit in the Canadian army. He was a field officer and was being considered for promotion to general in the British army. He was ordered to appear one morning in the office of the commanding general of the Canadian forces. His uniform was pressed and his buttons polished and his boots shining. President Brown recalled: “I walked smartly into the office of the general and I saluted him smartly, and he gave me the same kind of salute a senior officer usually gives—a sort of “Get out of the way, worm!” He then advised President Brown that he was not going to be appointed a general even though he had passed examinations and had the seniority and was a good officer.</p>
<p>He was being sent back to Canada to become a training officer and a transport officer. As the general slipped out of the room to answer a telephone, President Brown noticed on the general’s desk his personal history sheet. Across the bottom, in bold block-type letters, was written “THIS MAN IS A MORMON.”</p>
<p>The general came back, dismissed President Brown, and President Brown went away with a broken heart, bitterness in his soul, and a feeling of failure and disappointment. When he got back to his tent, he clenched his fists, shook them at heaven, and said:</p>
<p><i>“How could you do this to me, God? I have done everything I could to measure up. There is nothing that I could have done—that I should have done—that I haven’t done. How could you do this to me?” I was as bitter as gall.</i></p>
<p><i>And then I heard a voice, and I recognized the tone of this voice. It was my own voice, and the voice said, “I am the gardener here. I know what I want you to do.” The bitterness went out of my soul, and I fell on my knees by the cot to ask forgiveness for my ungratefulness and my bitterness.</i></p>
<p>President Brown would have been the senior military officer in all western Canada, with security and a good income, and he would have had to raise his daughters and two sons in army barracks. He commented that they probably would have married out of the Church and not amounted to anything.</p>
<p>President Brown concluded this remarkable story by saying that when we are overcome with disappointment and heartbreak and defeat, we should remember that</p>
<p><i>“God is the gardener here. He knows what he wants you to be.” Submit yourselves to his will. Be worthy of his blessings, and you will get his blessings. </i>[See Hugh B. Brown, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1973/01/the-currant-bush?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Currant Bush,”</a></span> <i>New Era, </i>January 1973, pp. 14–15]</p>
<p>I’m sure most of us feel like the currant bush at some time or another, but as we look back on some of the bumps of life, we can see how they have shaped us and helped us to develop.</p>
<p>I have been privileged to live in a time of the greatest accumulation of knowledge in the world’s history. I remember as a boy on the farm when we lit the coal-oil lamps after dark to light the house. Wood was the only source of heat for all of our cooking and warmth. When I was about eight years old I learned to drive a team of horses. That is much more difficult than driving a car. Sometimes one horse will not pull.</p>
<p>You all missed a lot not living in the time of the Model T Fords. If the Model T got hot enough, it would just keep going with spontaneous combustion when you turned off the ignition key. If the hill was too steep for the car to go up frontward, you turned around and backed up because it seemed to have more power in reverse. The first ones had to be hand-cranked in the summer and the winter because they had no starters. The medical doctors fixed a lot of broken arms because the Model T would backfire when men and women tried to start it with the hand crank. Looking back, it doesn’t seem like there was much mechanical inspiration in a Model T Ford. But then, they only cost $290 when mass produced.</p>
<p>You are the beneficiaries of all of the advances in science, medicine, travel, space, technology, communication, agriculture, entertainment, and all the other fields of knowledge God has revealed to mankind. All of this knowledge ought to be used for the blessing of mankind. It permits the work of the Lord to advance. For instance, jet airplanes permit General Authorities, area authorities, and auxiliary leaders to visit stakes all over the world for teaching and training.</p>
<p>I learned at a young age that inspiration can come to any of us. When I was in junior high school, I was taking a difficult class. Most of what was being taught went over my head. Perhaps I was not trying hard enough. The teacher asked me something. I didn’t understand the question, let alone the answer. Right out of nowhere a response came into my mind that I repeated to the teacher. To my surprise, it was the right answer, but I knew it had not come from me.</p>
<p>So how can we recognize inspiration when it comes? Enos stated, “While I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind” (Enos 1:10).</p>
<p>The voice is not necessarily audible. The spirit of revelation comes by divine confirmation. “I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart” (D&amp;C 8:2).</p>
<p>How did the voice of the Lord sound to Elijah the Tishbite? It was not the “strong wind [which] rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks,” nor was it “an earthquake,” nor “a fire.” Elijah described it as a “still small voice” (1 Kings 19:11–12).</p>
<p>It is that inner voice, the Spirit, that has the power to whisper through and pierce all things.</p>
<p>In the words of Helaman,</p>
<p><i>It was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul. </i>[Helaman 5:30]</p>
<h2>Inspiration and the Gift of the Holy Ghost</h2>
<p>We believe that all righteous people have the potential to receive inspiration from God. The many great masterpieces of music, art, poetry, and other creations of beauty testify to this. Handel’s glorious oratorio <i>Messiah </i>is proof of this.</p>
<p>Michelangelo’s statues of the Pietà, Moses, and David also testify of this. Surely the poet William Wordsworth was inspired when he wrote “Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood.”</p>
<p>The same is true of the inventors who have been inspired to bring us all of the marvelous inventions of our time.</p>
<p>We believe the Spirit of God can come to all men and women. This is in distinction to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Administrations of the Holy Ghost are limited without receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “there is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost” (<i>Teachings, </i>p. 199).</p>
<p>Many outside the Church have received revelation from the Holy Ghost, convincing them of the truth of the gospel. It is through this power that sincere investigators after the truth acquire a testimony of the Book of Mormon and the principles of the gospel before baptism.</p>
<p>However, those possessing the gift of the Holy Ghost can come to greater light and testimony. The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, so deeply that no earthly power can separate one from that knowledge. Indeed, not having the gift of the Holy Ghost is somewhat like having a body without a spiritual immune system.</p>
<p>The First Vision of Joseph Smith is the most remarkable epiphany in the history of the world. We are all familiar with the Prophet Joseph’s story. He retired to the Sacred Grove to inquire of the Lord as to which religion was correct. He was seized by a power that completely overcame him and bound his tongue so that he could not speak. He wrote, “Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.”</p>
<p>Then, calling forth all of the spiritual power he had, he asked God to deliver him from this power of darkness.</p>
<p><i>Just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i></p>
<p><i>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound.</i></p>
<p>Now here is the significant account:</p>
<p><i>When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS—H 1:15–17]</p>
<p>In the history of mankind, few indeed have been privileged to see God or hear Him directly. Yet the gifts of the Spirit since the restoration of the gospel have been rich in the Church and exist today among the faithful members of the Church.</p>
<p>My dear young friends, as Samuel was told, for those of you who do not yet know the Lord, to whom the word of the Lord has yet to be revealed, please open your spiritual ears and eyes. Tune your hearts and souls, as I had to do on my old crystal radio. Set your receiver to the exact spot in your soul where the spiritual signals are coming through. In so doing you will be able to perceive the simple, ordinary things of life in a marvelous new light. You will have remarkable spiritual insight.</p>
<p>To do this you will have to pray fervently, with a clean mind and a humble heart. You will need to earnestly try to keep all of the commandments. You will need to be in harmony with the leadership of the Church, from your bishop and stake president to the First Presidency.</p>
<p>If you can learn to hear the whispering of the Spirit and be guided by your spiritual leaders, you will avoid many of the pitfalls and heartaches of the world. You will have a comforting feeling of your great worth as a choice son or daughter of God. To this end I bless you.</p>
<p>Mine is the sure witness that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Of this I testify with all my soul, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters. I first want to thank the Brigham Young University administration for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today. It is always a pleasure to meet with the Saints. I also commend you for attending and watching these devotionals. When I first began my employment at BYU, a colleague of mine told me that if I attended devotionals, my work at the university would be blessed. I have certainly found that to be true. It is an honor to speak to you today, and I pray that the Holy Spirit will attend to help edify and uplift all of us.
Since beginning employment at BYU, one of my greatest fears has been giving a devotional talk. However, when I prayed about the invitation to speak to you, I not only received confirmation to give this talk, but I also received the topic to cover.
I thought I would start by telling you a little bit more about myself. I am originally from Rhode Island. I joined the Church as a graduate student in Logan, Utah, and I was fortunate enough to meet my wife, Andrea, while in graduate school. We have two boys: AJ, age twelve, and Andrew, age seven. My family is the love of my life, and I am extremely grateful that the Lord has blessed me with them.
I also want to wish you all a happy Pioneer Day. I had not heard of this holiday before ­moving to Utah, but it is a day for which I am grateful. It is so important to remember our ancestors and the sacrifices they made for us. I am from a family of immigrants, so I can relate to the story of the pioneers, who traveled great distances and bore up under hardships seeking a better life.
My grandfather Emilio Caldarella immigrated to the United States on the Gerty, a steamship from Pachino, Sicily, on June 28, 1906, at the age of eleven with his fourteen-year-old sister, Maria, and his forty-nine-year-old mother, Concetta. They had just twenty dollars between the three of them when they arrived. The voyage by steamship across the Atlantic took nearly three weeks. They first settled in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and eventually moved to Providence, Rhode Island.
As I was preparing this talk, I began to wonder what had led people like my grandfather and the early pioneers to leave their homes and loved ones and travel long distances at great personal expense and sacrifice. As I pondered this question, I began to realize that they had heeded the call of the Lord. How else could they have made those long treks and withstood the hardships that often accompanied those experiences? When we are called of the Lord, we can withstand such challenges.
I am a pioneer of sorts in that I am the first and only member of my family so far to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In my devotional talk today, I am going to use scriptures, hymns, art, quotes from Church leaders, and some of my own personal experiences.

As I was preparing for my talk, I was reminded of a story I once heard in a stake conference session a number of years ago. The story begins with a rancher performing chores out on his ranch one morning when he sees a shiny pickup truck drive onto his ranch and park.
Out of the truck steps a man in uniform who walks up to the rancher and states, “I’m here to inspect your ranch for any illegally grown drugs.”
The rancher responds, “Fine, but do not go in that field over there,” and points to a beautiful field to the east.
The officer replies, “Mister, I don’t think you understand me. I am here to inspect your ranch, and I have the authority of the federal government behind me.” Reaching into his pocket he pulls out some form of a badge and proudly displays the badge to the rancher. “See this badge, old man? This badge means I am allowed to go on any land,” he says, pointing all across the farmer’s ranch. “Have I made myself clear?”
The rancher apologizes, nods, and goes about his chores.
A short while later the old rancher hears someone screaming, looks up, and sees the officer running while being chased by a large bull in the field that the rancher had told the officer not to enter. With every step the officer takes, the bull takes two. With the distance shrinking between the charging bull and the frantic officer, the rancher steps up onto the fence enclosing the field and yells, “Your badge—show him your badge!”
On college campuses everywhere, including this one, we do a fair amount of badge showing—and for good reason. Our faculty have gone to top graduate schools and have trained with many of the best scholars, which, among other benefits, has helped prepare them to stand at the front of their classrooms and speak with expertise and authority. Unfortunately I have no badge to pull from my pocket demonstrating my credentials to speak today. I am grateful for the vote of confidence from President Worthen and Vice President Richardson in extending this invitation. I am also grateful to each of you for coming to today’s devotional. It is not lost on me that you have the choice to attend or not. To this end, I hope and pray for the presence of the Spirit and that we may be edified as a result.
I am grateful for my wife, Marcie, and for my children, all of whom are here except for our oldest daughter, Sarah, who is serving a mission in South Carolina and happens to return from her mission next week; we are excited at our house. I am grateful for my mother, other family members, and dear friends and colleagues who are here today as well.
Rafting Gone Awry
I had the good fortune of growing up in the state of Alaska. It was a fantastic place to be raised. As an example of this, each year our Boy Scout troop would plan and carry out amazing high-adventure camps. We would go backpacking, </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As I begin my message today I would like you to think back on a time when you were completely lost. You may have been hiking in the wilderness, been trying to find your way to a meeting in a new city, or been separated from your parents at an amusement park. Can you remember how you felt? You may have felt frightened, embarrassed, or desperate for help. How did you ultimately find your way? Rather than focusing on the dreadful experience of being lost, I would like to speak about guiding principles that can help us find our way.
For many years I have been interested in the topic of navigation, specifically in figuring out ways for unmanned aircraft—commonly called drones—to find their way from one location to another. For me, this topic is both technically fascinating and an interesting metaphor for our mortal journey through life.
The scriptures are replete with examples of journeys or paths used as symbols for our lives here on earth. A couple of my favorites include the stories of Lehi and his family being led to the promised land by the Liahona1 and the stories about the Israelites wandering in the wilderness and being led and protected by a “pillar of . . . cloud by day” and a “pillar of fire by night.”2
This common use of the path or a journey as a teaching aid leads me to ask, “What is to be learned from these accounts? How can we be led by our Father in Heaven through the wilderness of life to our own promised land? And what about the more modern techie metaphor of drone navigation? Are there useful parallels to consider between our course through this earthly life and the way a drone finds its way around?” Let’s explore this topic a little.
Using Feedback to Help Us Navigate
I have had the opportunity to perform research on drones with fantastic colleagues and students for the past seventeen years. Our primary goal has been to make small unmanned aircraft capable of performing useful tasks without the direct control of a pilot, using innovative combinations of sensors and algorithms implemented on board the aircraft.
Whether flying to avoid obstacles such as buildings or canyon walls, coordinating the actions of multiple drones, or navigating through a crowded building, the approaches we have used have always involved four important components: first, having a goal or a desired objective; second, sensing the state of the aircraft and the environment around it; third, processing the sensor information to determine the input commands to the aircraft; and fourth, sending the commands to the aircraft motors to produce the desired behavior.
Similarly, for us to reach our ultimate ­objectives in life, we must have a vision or goal that defines the path we should take. We must have ways to assess our progress along our path and whether we are close to or far away from it. We must have the ability to reason and make decisions about ways to imp</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">We live in some challenging times. More than fifty years ago President Thomas S. Monson said:
Today, we are encamped against the greatest array of sin, vice, and evil ever assembled before our eyes.1
I thought to myself that whatever the conditions were fifty years ago, there is a greater array today. The war between good and evil is raging and intensifying. Satan is busy radicalizing and recruiting. You are needed. You must gain the skills, convictions, courage, wisdom, and confidence to help make a difference for yourself and others. I am grateful for the inspired leadership of the Twelve and the First Presidency to help us be prepared.
Most of you are at a significant transition point in your lives. You are making life-­changing decisions about your education, careers, marriage, and family as well as your religious practice after schooling and missions. You are making decisions as you transition from being dependent on goals set by others to being independent and self-reliant, setting your own goals and making your own way. Many of those decisions are not as clear or as easy to make as you would like them to be. Trying to find your way is a challenge.
Today I would like to share a few lessons I have learned that may help you find your way. I invite you to take notes of any “actionable takeaways.” Later you can decide how to act on what you hear.
Set Your Destination, Prepare, and Act on Your Plan
After graduating from BYU, I took a job with the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington. I was soon called as an assistant Scoutmaster in our ward. One year we spent the summer taking hikes, including a fifty-miler around Mount Rainier. The early hikes prepared us physically and helped us develop the skills needed for the ultimate hike. We learned how to use maps and the compass and also to set checkpoints along the trail to find where we were and how to get where we wanted to go. It was a wonderful time for us.
For the Scouts, a hike in the Cascades was an exciting adventure and an end in itself, but for us, as leaders, it was an opportunity to teach them the skills, character traits, and testimony needed for life’s journey.
Our journeys of life are like these hikes. We each choose our destination and path. However, after the judgment at the end of this life, we will be assigned a place to live and things to do based on our decisions and actions here. Choose wisely the best path as described by the plan of salvation. Map your course by learning as much as you can, setting your checkpoints, and following your plan.
You Have a Royal Heritage
Throughout literature there are stories told of individuals who were destined for greatness or were of royal birth who were sent away from their homes. They did not know who they were, their heritage, or their destiny. You know about Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, and perhaps a few others.
