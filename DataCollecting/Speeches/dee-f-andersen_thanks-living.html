  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Witness to Our Thankfulness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In an essay called “The Art of Living,” Wilfred Peterson has written:

&lt;i&gt;The art of thanksgiving is &lt;/i&gt;thanks-living. &lt;i&gt;It is gratitude in action. &lt;/i&gt;. . .

&lt;i&gt;It is thanking God for the gift of life by living it triumphantly. &lt;/i&gt;. . .

&lt;i&gt;It is thanking God for opportunities by accepting them as a challenge to achievement. &lt;/i&gt;. . .

&lt;i&gt;It is thanking God for inspiration by living to be an inspiration to others. &lt;/i&gt;. . .

&lt;i&gt;It is adding to your prayers of thanksgiving, acts of &lt;/i&gt;thanks-living. [&lt;i&gt;The Art of Living &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961), pp. 44–45]

President David O. McKay counseled Church members:

&lt;i&gt;Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. Gratitude is the completion of thankfulness. Thankfulness may consist merely of words. Gratitude is shown in acts. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Pathways to Happiness &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, Inc., 1957), p. 317]

Some of the beautiful words of Psalm 100 stress: “Know ye that the Lord he is God: . . . be thankful unto him, and bless his name.”

And again, the Lord, through his great prophet King Benjamin, has taught us there is more than just thoughts and prayers to proper thanksgiving. I quote:

&lt;i&gt;I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice. &lt;/i&gt;. . .

. . . &lt;i&gt;if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.&lt;/i&gt;

. . . &lt;i&gt;all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; &lt;/i&gt;. . . &lt;i&gt;if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you. &lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 2:20–22]

If we are truly thankful, our &lt;i&gt;acts &lt;/i&gt;will be witness to our thankfulness.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Showing Our Thankfulness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Thanksgiving Day has always been designed to be a religious experience, a day to know the Lord and bless his name.

Three hundred sixty-four years ago, Governor William Bradford declared a three-day fast, and a small group of pilgrims gathered to “worship and give thanks to God.” Two years later, in 1623, on July 30, the first official Thanksgiving Day was set up for “the special purpose of prayer.” During the revolutionary war there were some eight special days of thanks, which were observed for “special blessings that had been received.” On November 26, 1789, more than 100 years after the first special day of prayer, President George Washington issued a special proclamation for a day of “giving thanks.” And about 100 years later in 1863 President Abraham Lincoln designated the last Thursday in November as “a day of thanksgiving and praise to our benevolent Father.” Now, after more than three and a half centuries, we still celebrate a “Thanksgiving Day.”

But in our hearts, is there sufficient thankfulness to really give praise to our benevolent Father? Does this thankfulness result in showing any true gratitude? Do we do any more than say a thanksgiving prayer over the traditional Thanksgiving feast? Or are some of our prayers and our lives like those described by the poet Robert Burns— “Three mile prayers and one-half mile graces”? Have we learned to say thank you and to show thank you?

I like these words—they seem to suggest action:

&lt;i&gt;If you hear a kind word spoken &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Of some worthy soul you know, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It may fill his heart with sunshine &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If you’d only tell him so.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If a deed, however humble, helps you &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On your way to go,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Seek the one whose hand has helped you. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Seek him out and tell him so.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If your heart is touched and tender &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Toward a sinner lost and low,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It might help him to do better&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If you would only tell him so. &lt;/i&gt;
[Anonymous]

President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught us:

&lt;i&gt;Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;Oct. 1964, p. 117]

Thankfulness may indeed be measured by the number of words we use. Gratitude, however, must be measured by the nature of our actions.

And Richard L. Evans said: “Gratitude has not even been born until it has actually been converted into word and deed.”

Each of us should look for ways of saying thank you to each other, and we should show our thankfulness to the Lord by keeping his commandments.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saying Thank You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In the past I have not always been able to &lt;i&gt;say &lt;/i&gt;or show my thanks as I have really wanted to. Some years ago, almost every morning I found myself arriving in the parking lot of a certain institution at the same time as another individual. It was early in the morning, usually very dark and very quiet. Most of the time we were alone as we walked from our vehicles into the building. This individual was one of the finest persons I have ever known. I looked up to him. I admired him, I loved him. Yet I had never told him so. Each time we entered the building and climbed onto the elevator together, I found myself tongue-tied. I could hardly stammer “Good morning,” much less, “Oh, how I admire you” or “Thank you for all you have done and are doing for me.” After one of these mornings, I arrived in my office, disgusted with my inability to express my appreciation. In desperation, with a great desire to just say thank you, I took a pen in hand, and in longhand wrote a short note that expressed my feelings. Hurriedly I addressed an envelope and quickly mailed the note before my courage failed me. A &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;few days later I received a very sweet, short, three-sentence note. I could tell he had personally typed it out on the old typewriter he kept by his desk. It read:

&lt;i&gt;Dear Dee,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That was one of the sweetest notes I have ever received, and I appreciate hearing from you. I am indeed grateful to be so close to you, and I hope that we may see each other once in a while. May the Lord bless you and assist you in all your efforts. With kindest wishes.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Faithfully yours,&lt;/i&gt;

While I had known this individual and worked closely with him for a long time, this was really the beginning of a choice and wonderful friendship with this special person—President Spencer W. Kimball. Oh, how President Kimball blessed my life because I took the time and had the courage to say thank you.

Think how the Lord then desires to bless each of us as we &lt;i&gt;show our thankfulness &lt;/i&gt;by keeping the commandments. For he tells us that as we “abide the law,” we will receive the blessing (D&amp;amp;C 132:5).

How long has it been since any of us has really expressed a sincere and specific thank you to someone near or dear to us? To our parents? To a faculty member? To a student? To a roommate? Or to the Lord?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Thanks for the Memories”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My grandson taught me a lesson about saying thanks. Jared, who is now eight years old, lives in Hong Kong. As he has grown up, he has heard his father and me talk about our fishing trips. He has even accompanied us a time or two on short trips. But, because of his age, he had never caught a fish. Two years ago as his parents prepared for home leave, they noticed that Jared prayed each evening that he could go fishing, and he continued so to pray. When the family arrived in the United States, we arranged a fishing experience. We visited Jackson Hole and found a place on the Snake River where Jared could indeed catch some fish. And he did. He caught several. I’ll admit that he wasn’t very interested in baiting his hook or taking the fish off the hook when they were caught. Nevertheless, he seemed to enjoy the experience. I was interested in the report Jared would make to his Father in Heaven that night. It was very short. It expressed true thankfulness. It was only four words long. He said, “Thanks for the memories.”

Each of us has been given very special experiences and memories. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all say “Thanks for the memories?”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Way We Live&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Alice Cary, in her poem “Nobility,” states:

&lt;i&gt;True worth is in &lt;/i&gt;being, &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;seeming,—
&lt;i&gt;In doing, each day that goes by,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Some little good—not in dreaming&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Of great things to do by and by.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For whatever men say in their blindness,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And spite of the fancies of youth,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There’s nothing so kingly as kindness,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And nothing so royal as truth.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We get back our mete as we measure—&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We cannot do wrong and feel right,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nor can we give pain and gain pleasure,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For justice avenges each slight.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We cannot make bargains for blisses,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nor catch them like fishes in nets;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And sometimes the thing our life misses&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Helps more than the thing which it gets.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For good lieth not in pursuing,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nor gaining of great nor of small,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But just in the doing, and doing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As we would be done by, is all.&lt;/i&gt;

In our “doing and doing,” each of us can say thank you to those around us by simply living that golden rule.

I would like to conclude these remarks by stressing three sentences from the mission statement of this great university:

&lt;i&gt;All students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can be saved. Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.&lt;/i&gt;

If we do have this loving, genuine concern for others, Brigham Young University will be like no other place on earth, and so it should be.

Remember, as important as saying thank you is, it is more important to show our thankfulness in the way we live. We need to give others some reason to say thank you to us. May we show our thanksgiving this year by our thanks-living. For the Lord God has said:

&lt;i&gt;And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundredfold, yea, more. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 78:19]

May we be so blessed, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<h2><b>Witness to Our Thankfulness</b></h2>
<p>In an essay called “The Art of Living,” Wilfred Peterson has written:</p>
<p><i>The art of thanksgiving is </i>thanks-living. <i>It is gratitude in action. </i>. . .</p>
<p><i>It is thanking God for the gift of life by living it triumphantly. </i>. . .</p>
<p><i>It is thanking God for opportunities by accepting them as a challenge to achievement. </i>. . .</p>
<p><i>It is thanking God for inspiration by living to be an inspiration to others. </i>. . .</p>
<p><i>It is adding to your prayers of thanksgiving, acts of </i>thanks-living. [<i>The Art of Living </i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961), pp. 44–45]</p>
<p>President David O. McKay counseled Church members:</p>
<p><i>Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. Gratitude is the completion of thankfulness. Thankfulness may consist merely of words. Gratitude is shown in acts. </i>[<i>Pathways to Happiness </i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, Inc., 1957), p. 317]</p>
<p>Some of the beautiful words of Psalm 100 stress: “Know ye that the Lord he is God: . . . be thankful unto him, and bless his name.”</p>
<p>And again, the Lord, through his great prophet King Benjamin, has taught us there is more than just thoughts and prayers to proper thanksgiving. I quote:</p>
<p><i>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice. </i>. . .</p>
<p>. . . <i>if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i></p>
<p>. . . <i>all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; </i>. . . <i>if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you. </i>[Mosiah 2:20–22]</p>
<p>If we are truly thankful, our <i>acts </i>will be witness to our thankfulness.</p>
<h2><b>Showing Our Thankfulness</b></h2>
<p>Thanksgiving Day has always been designed to be a religious experience, a day to know the Lord and bless his name.</p>
<p>Three hundred sixty-four years ago, Governor William Bradford declared a three-day fast, and a small group of pilgrims gathered to “worship and give thanks to God.” Two years later, in 1623, on July 30, the first official Thanksgiving Day was set up for “the special purpose of prayer.” During the revolutionary war there were some eight special days of thanks, which were observed for “special blessings that had been received.” On November 26, 1789, more than 100 years after the first special day of prayer, President George Washington issued a special proclamation for a day of “giving thanks.” And about 100 years later in 1863 President Abraham Lincoln designated the last Thursday in November as “a day of thanksgiving and praise to our benevolent Father.” Now, after more than three and a half centuries, we still celebrate a “Thanksgiving Day.”</p>
<p>But in our hearts, is there sufficient thankfulness to really give praise to our benevolent Father? Does this thankfulness result in showing any true gratitude? Do we do any more than say a thanksgiving prayer over the traditional Thanksgiving feast? Or are some of our prayers and our lives like those described by the poet Robert Burns— “Three mile prayers and one-half mile graces”? Have we learned to say thank you and to show thank you?</p>
<p>I like these words—they seem to suggest action:</p>
<p><i>If you hear a kind word spoken </i><br />
<i>Of some worthy soul you know, </i><br />
<i>It may fill his heart with sunshine </i><br />
<i>If you’d only tell him so.</i></p>
<p><i>If a deed, however humble, helps you </i><br />
<i>On your way to go,</i><br />
<i>Seek the one whose hand has helped you. </i><br />
<i>Seek him out and tell him so.</i></p>
<p><i>If your heart is touched and tender </i><br />
<i>Toward a sinner lost and low,</i><br />
<i>It might help him to do better</i><br />
<i>If you would only tell him so. </i><br />
[Anonymous]</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught us:</p>
<p><i>Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. </i>[<i>CR, </i>Oct. 1964, p. 117]</p>
<p>Thankfulness may indeed be measured by the number of words we use. Gratitude, however, must be measured by the nature of our actions.</p>
<p>And Richard L. Evans said: “Gratitude has not even been born until it has actually been converted into word and deed.”</p>
<p>Each of us should look for ways of saying thank you to each other, and we should show our thankfulness to the Lord by keeping his commandments.</p>
<h2><b>Saying Thank You</b></h2>
<p>In the past I have not always been able to <i>say </i>or show my thanks as I have really wanted to. Some years ago, almost every morning I found myself arriving in the parking lot of a certain institution at the same time as another individual. It was early in the morning, usually very dark and very quiet. Most of the time we were alone as we walked from our vehicles into the building. This individual was one of the finest persons I have ever known. I looked up to him. I admired him, I loved him. Yet I had never told him so. Each time we entered the building and climbed onto the elevator together, I found myself tongue-tied. I could hardly stammer “Good morning,” much less, “Oh, how I admire you” or “Thank you for all you have done and are doing for me.” After one of these mornings, I arrived in my office, disgusted with my inability to express my appreciation. In desperation, with a great desire to just say thank you, I took a pen in hand, and in longhand wrote a short note that expressed my feelings. Hurriedly I addressed an envelope and quickly mailed the note before my courage failed me. A <i>very </i>few days later I received a very sweet, short, three-sentence note. I could tell he had personally typed it out on the old typewriter he kept by his desk. It read:</p>
<p><i>Dear Dee,</i></p>
<p><i>That was one of the sweetest notes I have ever received, and I appreciate hearing from you. I am indeed grateful to be so close to you, and I hope that we may see each other once in a while. May the Lord bless you and assist you in all your efforts. With kindest wishes.</i></p>
<p><i>Faithfully yours,</i></p>
<p>While I had known this individual and worked closely with him for a long time, this was really the beginning of a choice and wonderful friendship with this special person—President Spencer W. Kimball. Oh, how President Kimball blessed my life because I took the time and had the courage to say thank you.</p>
<p>Think how the Lord then desires to bless each of us as we <i>show our thankfulness </i>by keeping the commandments. For he tells us that as we “abide the law,” we will receive the blessing (D&amp;C 132:5).</p>
<p>How long has it been since any of us has really expressed a sincere and specific thank you to someone near or dear to us? To our parents? To a faculty member? To a student? To a roommate? Or to the Lord?</p>
<h2><b>“Thanks for the Memories”</b></h2>
<p>My grandson taught me a lesson about saying thanks. Jared, who is now eight years old, lives in Hong Kong. As he has grown up, he has heard his father and me talk about our fishing trips. He has even accompanied us a time or two on short trips. But, because of his age, he had never caught a fish. Two years ago as his parents prepared for home leave, they noticed that Jared prayed each evening that he could go fishing, and he continued so to pray. When the family arrived in the United States, we arranged a fishing experience. We visited Jackson Hole and found a place on the Snake River where Jared could indeed catch some fish. And he did. He caught several. I’ll admit that he wasn’t very interested in baiting his hook or taking the fish off the hook when they were caught. Nevertheless, he seemed to enjoy the experience. I was interested in the report Jared would make to his Father in Heaven that night. It was very short. It expressed true thankfulness. It was only four words long. He said, “Thanks for the memories.”</p>
<p>Each of us has been given very special experiences and memories. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all say “Thanks for the memories?”</p>
<h2><b>The Way We Live</b></h2>
<p>Alice Cary, in her poem “Nobility,” states:</p>
<p><i>True worth is in </i>being, <i>not </i>seeming,—<br />
<i>In doing, each day that goes by,</i><br />
<i>Some little good—not in dreaming</i><br />
<i>Of great things to do by and by.</i></p>
<p><i>For whatever men say in their blindness,</i><br />
<i>And spite of the fancies of youth,</i><br />
<i>There’s nothing so kingly as kindness,</i><br />
<i>And nothing so royal as truth.</i></p>
<p><i>We get back our mete as we measure—</i><br />
<i>We cannot do wrong and feel right,</i><br />
<i>Nor can we give pain and gain pleasure,</i><br />
<i>For justice avenges each slight.</i></p>
<p><i>We cannot make bargains for blisses,</i><br />
<i>Nor catch them like fishes in nets;</i><br />
<i>And sometimes the thing our life misses</i><br />
<i>Helps more than the thing which it gets.</i></p>
<p><i>For good lieth not in pursuing,</i><br />
<i>Nor gaining of great nor of small,</i><br />
<i>But just in the doing, and doing</i><br />
<i>As we would be done by, is all.</i></p>
<p>In our “doing and doing,” each of us can say thank you to those around us by simply living that golden rule.</p>
<p>I would like to conclude these remarks by stressing three sentences from the mission statement of this great university:</p>
<p><i>All students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can be saved. Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.</i></p>
<p>If we do have this loving, genuine concern for others, Brigham Young University will be like no other place on earth, and so it should be.</p>
<p>Remember, as important as saying thank you is, it is more important to show our thankfulness in the way we live. We need to give others some reason to say thank you to us. May we show our thanksgiving this year by our thanks-living. For the Lord God has said:</p>
<p><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundredfold, yea, more. </i>[D&amp;C 78:19]</p>
<p>May we be so blessed, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in ­general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question “What lack I yet?” and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, “Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer.”
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to “be more cheerful” or to “smile more often” or to “count their blessings.”
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happi­ness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing “an unconscious smile.”1 I have known people like that—­individuals who are continually smiling ­without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being “temple worthy,” what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day—and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet—and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to “thank the Lord thy God in all things” (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (Children’s Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song—“hear[ing] the song of a bird,” “look[ing] at the blue . . . sky,” having eyes to “see The color of butterfly wings,” and feeling “the wind as it rushes by.” Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, “What is a SWKT?” I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges—including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. [“Stories of the Century,” comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 1999–2000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lee’s memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the student’s tuition. . . .

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn “Count Your Blessings.” I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact—not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: “I can live for two months on a good compliment.”3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift—from friends, from family, from God—and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change people’s lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles—500 of it on foot. I’m not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I don’t believe I’ve ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lord’s hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries—our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease—we sometimes forget to confess the Lord’s hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimball’s statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Let’s take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
