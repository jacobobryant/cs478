  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.

What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.

I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:

&lt;i&gt;On the day you were born, you cried and your family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.

Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on - and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy - one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.

In some ways this statement is the practical essence of Gods plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch - choices that help us &lt;i&gt;become.&lt;/i&gt;

I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:

&lt;i&gt;Yesterdays the past, tomorrows the future, but today is a &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;gift.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Thats why its called the present.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

With this gift of time, you wont always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what happens to you.

Develop your legacy intentionally. Determine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.

Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
God has given us two things in life: &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;opportunity&lt;/i&gt; to choose what you do with it.

This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We cant refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a tiny little minute, but your eternal future lies within it. Now dont you miss it.

In the book of Helaman, Nephi described his time as "our days."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Friends, these are our days.

What do our days look like in the world that we live in? The Lord gave us a hint when He said, "It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; But He also gave us opportunities to choose so we can learn from that opposition.

I have learned much from a book entitled &lt;i&gt;Why Did This Happen to Me?&lt;/i&gt; by Ray Pritchard. Mr. Pritchard said:

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes we will face things for which there is no earthly explanation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; In those moments we need to erect a sign that reads, "Quiet: God at Work." Meanwhile, hold on, child of God. Keep believing. Dont quit. Dont give up. Let God do His work in you. The greatest tragedy is to miss what God wants to teach us through our troubles.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

This life isnt easy. It wasnt designed to be. It is very hard. These are the last days, but you are a chosen generation blessed with what you need for these times. You have lived in the promised land, but it is not Disneyland. Throughout your lives, all of you will experience both success and failure. Do not be too anxious for the applause for the success or for the pity for the failure. Remember, the common denominator in both success and failure is that neither of these conditions is permanent.

President Howard W. Hunter taught us:

&lt;i&gt;If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

So it is up to you. Let me add a few words to Berton Braleys poem titled "Success":

&lt;i&gt;If you want a thing bad enough&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To go out and fight for it,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Work day and night for it,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it,&lt;/i&gt; . . .
&lt;i&gt;If youll simply go after that thing that you want,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;With all your capacity,&lt;/i&gt; . . .
&lt;i&gt;Faith, hope and confidence, stern&lt;/i&gt; [tenacity], . . .
&lt;i&gt;If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,&lt;/i&gt;
[If you determine now how you will measure your life in the end,]
&lt;i&gt;Youll get it!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Know who you are in relation to God and to each other. When you really understand this, you will act differently and will treat others differently.

Let me tell you a story about some children who knew who they really were and who understood their relationships to each other.

The story occurred at a track and field meet for children with special needs. The children had trained and were so excited for this day. Try to imagine the parents of these physically or mentally challenged children who had decided to run in these races. The parents thought that if their children could win, it would be good for their self-esteem.

The parents sat in the stands waiting for the races to begin. Their children were on the track getting ready for the 100-meter dash. As the gun fired, all nine contestants began to run. Not long into the race, one of the boys fell down, hurt his knee, and started to cry. The other racers, hearing him cry, stopped, turned around, and went back and gathered around him. One little girl with Down syndrome kissed him on the head and said, "Now that will make it better." Together they lifted him up, joined arms, and walked to the finish line together.

To the parents, what had begun as an exciting race was now a little confusing as they watched those little athletes walk to the finish line together. The parents stood and cheered. And they cheered for a long time. They realized that these children knew all along who they really were and what winning really means. The parents thought self-esteem would come from winning, but they learned that self-esteem comes from doing &lt;i&gt;esteemable&lt;/i&gt; things every day.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Never love anything that cant love you back. Remember, a distraction doesnt have to be evil to be effective.

Now make no mistake: we want you to be competitive, we want you to be successful, and we want you to rise to the top. But you might think owning things will make that easier - the latest cell phones and devices, virtual reality, and surround sound. These things are wonderful to have, but in life the real dance starts when the music stops.

Life is not about accumulation. Life is about contribution.

The world would have you believe that success is all about fame and fortune. But as we have all heard before, money does not buy happiness; it only makes you wealthy. Happiness is not measured in zeros but in relationships.

Now dont be afraid that you wont become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Tom Brady or J. K. Rowling. Here is what ought to scare you to death: that at the end of your life you wont have become who you were supposed to have become while you were here.

John Greenleaf Whittier wrote:

&lt;i&gt;For of all sad words of tongue or pen,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The saddest are these: "It might have been!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

Graduates, you are ready to launch. And the Lord is counting on you.

The story of Job is a wonderful example of the principles that we have talked about today. At the beginning of the story, Job was described as an upright man who feared God, and God blessed him. Job had vast wealth, a good family, and was important in the community and amongst his peers. Then Job had all of that taken from him.

In Job 29 we find Job remembering the days when he had all those things. His words teach us a very important principle. He recounted, "Oh that I were as in months past."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

Now that is a reflection of a man looking back on his life. That will happen to you someday as you reflect back on your lives.

Job went on to say that the Lord had blessed him with the Spirit and that he had had his children around him. Describing his great wealth, he said, "The rock poured me out rivers of oil."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; It seemed that everything Job had touched had turned to gold. He had had the respect of others. When Job approached, "the young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. The princes refrained talking."&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

Job described those wonderful days, and then he taught us the secret. Job said he had had all of these things

&lt;i&gt;because I delivered the poor&lt;/i&gt; . . . &lt;i&gt;and him that had none to help him. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

The reason Job had all that wealth and status was because he was good to his fellowmen. He did all of the "esteemable" things that we do for those who need our help. Job even went looking for ways to help others.

All along Job knew the secret and the order from which greatness comes. Job also knew who would get him through the dark and difficult days. Job used his time wisely and intentionally. He knew who he was in relationship to God and to others. He loved the right things.

As we seek the Lord, we should remember His promise to us: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God . . . ; and all these things shall be added unto you."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; We must always seek Him first and not the reverse.

The Lord knows who you are. He knows your circumstances, and He will help you. He will bless you as you bless others. As inscribed at the entrance to this university, "Enter to learn [which you have done]; [now] go forth to serve." On behalf of your professors, your parents, and your friends, I give you words from a song written by Don Besig:

&lt;i&gt;The time we had together is almost at an end,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and now we have to try to say good-bye.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Theres so much to remember, and so much still ahead,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I wish you all the good things you can find.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wherever life may lead you, may you go with a song in your heart,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and a spirit inside that makes you want to sing.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When you find someone who needs you, may you share the song in your heart&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and discover all the joy that it can bring.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

This graduation day is just one beginning of many. When you look back upon this experience called mortality, how will you measure your life? My prayer is that when you graduate from this earth life, you will rejoice and others will cry.

I testify that the Savior lives and that the day will come when we will go to be with Him or He will return to be with us. And when He does, "we shall see him as he is."&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; And He will see us as we are, or as we have become. May we become like Him I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.</p>
<p>What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.</p>
<p>I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:</p>
<p><i>On the day you were born, you cried and your family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.</p>
<p>Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on - and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy - one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.</p>
<p>In some ways this statement is the practical essence of Gods plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch - choices that help us <i>become.</i></p>
<p>I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:</p>
<p><i>Yesterdays the past, tomorrows the future, but today is a </i><b><i>gift.</i></b><i> Thats why its called the present.</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>With this gift of time, you wont always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what happens to you.</p>
<p>Develop your legacy intentionally. Determine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.</p>
<p>Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.</p>
<h2><b>First Secret</b></h2>
<p>God has given us two things in life: <i>time</i> and the <i>opportunity</i> to choose what you do with it.</p>
<p>This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We cant refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a tiny little minute, but your eternal future lies within it. Now dont you miss it.</p>
<p>In the book of Helaman, Nephi described his time as "our days."<sup>3</sup> Friends, these are our days.</p>
<p>What do our days look like in the world that we live in? The Lord gave us a hint when He said, "It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."<sup>4</sup> But He also gave us opportunities to choose so we can learn from that opposition.</p>
<p>I have learned much from a book entitled <i>Why Did This Happen to Me?</i> by Ray Pritchard. Mr. Pritchard said:</p>
<p><b><i>Sometimes we will face things for which there is no earthly explanation.</i></b><i> In those moments we need to erect a sign that reads, "Quiet: God at Work." Meanwhile, hold on, child of God. Keep believing. Dont quit. Dont give up. Let God do His work in you. The greatest tragedy is to miss what God wants to teach us through our troubles.</i><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>This life isnt easy. It wasnt designed to be. It is very hard. These are the last days, but you are a chosen generation blessed with what you need for these times. You have lived in the promised land, but it is not Disneyland. Throughout your lives, all of you will experience both success and failure. Do not be too anxious for the applause for the success or for the pity for the failure. Remember, the common denominator in both success and failure is that neither of these conditions is permanent.</p>
<p>President Howard W. Hunter taught us:</p>
<p><i>If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>So it is up to you. Let me add a few words to Berton Braleys poem titled "Success":</p>
<p><i>If you want a thing bad enough</i><br />
<i>To go out and fight for it,</i><br />
<i>Work day and night for it,</i><br />
<i>Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it,</i> . . .<br />
<i>If youll simply go after that thing that you want,</i><br />
<i>With all your capacity,</i> . . .<br />
<i>Faith, hope and confidence, stern</i> [tenacity], . . .<br />
<i>If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,</i><br />
[If you determine now how you will measure your life in the end,]<br />
<i>Youll get it!</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<h2><b>Second Secret</b></h2>
<p>Know who you are in relation to God and to each other. When you really understand this, you will act differently and will treat others differently.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story about some children who knew who they really were and who understood their relationships to each other.</p>
<p>The story occurred at a track and field meet for children with special needs. The children had trained and were so excited for this day. Try to imagine the parents of these physically or mentally challenged children who had decided to run in these races. The parents thought that if their children could win, it would be good for their self-esteem.</p>
<p>The parents sat in the stands waiting for the races to begin. Their children were on the track getting ready for the 100-meter dash. As the gun fired, all nine contestants began to run. Not long into the race, one of the boys fell down, hurt his knee, and started to cry. The other racers, hearing him cry, stopped, turned around, and went back and gathered around him. One little girl with Down syndrome kissed him on the head and said, "Now that will make it better." Together they lifted him up, joined arms, and walked to the finish line together.</p>
<p>To the parents, what had begun as an exciting race was now a little confusing as they watched those little athletes walk to the finish line together. The parents stood and cheered. And they cheered for a long time. They realized that these children knew all along who they really were and what winning really means. The parents thought self-esteem would come from winning, but they learned that self-esteem comes from doing <i>esteemable</i> things every day.</p>
<h2><b>Third Secret</b></h2>
<p>Never love anything that cant love you back. Remember, a distraction doesnt have to be evil to be effective.</p>
<p>Now make no mistake: we want you to be competitive, we want you to be successful, and we want you to rise to the top. But you might think owning things will make that easier - the latest cell phones and devices, virtual reality, and surround sound. These things are wonderful to have, but in life the real dance starts when the music stops.</p>
<p>Life is not about accumulation. Life is about contribution.</p>
<p>The world would have you believe that success is all about fame and fortune. But as we have all heard before, money does not buy happiness; it only makes you wealthy. Happiness is not measured in zeros but in relationships.</p>
<p>Now dont be afraid that you wont become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Tom Brady or J. K. Rowling. Here is what ought to scare you to death: that at the end of your life you wont have become who you were supposed to have become while you were here.</p>
<p>John Greenleaf Whittier wrote:</p>
<p><i>For of all sad words of tongue or pen,</i><br />
<i>The saddest are these: "It might have been!"</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Graduates, you are ready to launch. And the Lord is counting on you.</p>
<p>The story of Job is a wonderful example of the principles that we have talked about today. At the beginning of the story, Job was described as an upright man who feared God, and God blessed him. Job had vast wealth, a good family, and was important in the community and amongst his peers. Then Job had all of that taken from him.</p>
<p>In Job 29 we find Job remembering the days when he had all those things. His words teach us a very important principle. He recounted, "Oh that I were as in months past."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Now that is a reflection of a man looking back on his life. That will happen to you someday as you reflect back on your lives.</p>
<p>Job went on to say that the Lord had blessed him with the Spirit and that he had had his children around him. Describing his great wealth, he said, "The rock poured me out rivers of oil."<sup>10</sup> It seemed that everything Job had touched had turned to gold. He had had the respect of others. When Job approached, "the young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. The princes refrained talking."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Job described those wonderful days, and then he taught us the secret. Job said he had had all of these things</p>
<p><i>because I delivered the poor</i> . . . <i>and him that had none to help him. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</i></p>
<p><i>I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>The reason Job had all that wealth and status was because he was good to his fellowmen. He did all of the "esteemable" things that we do for those who need our help. Job even went looking for ways to help others.</p>
<p>All along Job knew the secret and the order from which greatness comes. Job also knew who would get him through the dark and difficult days. Job used his time wisely and intentionally. He knew who he was in relationship to God and to others. He loved the right things.</p>
<p>As we seek the Lord, we should remember His promise to us: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God . . . ; and all these things shall be added unto you."<sup>13</sup> We must always seek Him first and not the reverse.</p>
<p>The Lord knows who you are. He knows your circumstances, and He will help you. He will bless you as you bless others. As inscribed at the entrance to this university, "Enter to learn [which you have done]; [now] go forth to serve." On behalf of your professors, your parents, and your friends, I give you words from a song written by Don Besig:</p>
<p><i>The time we had together is almost at an end,</i><br />
<i>and now we have to try to say good-bye.</i><br />
<i>Theres so much to remember, and so much still ahead,</i><br />
<i>I wish you all the good things you can find.</i></p>
<p><i>Wherever life may lead you, may you go with a song in your heart,</i><br />
<i>and a spirit inside that makes you want to sing.</i><br />
<i>When you find someone who needs you, may you share the song in your heart</i><br />
<i>and discover all the joy that it can bring.</i><sup>14</sup></p>
<p>This graduation day is just one beginning of many. When you look back upon this experience called mortality, how will you measure your life? My prayer is that when you graduate from this earth life, you will rejoice and others will cry.</p>
<p>I testify that the Savior lives and that the day will come when we will go to be with Him or He will return to be with us. And when He does, "we shall see him as he is."<sup>15</sup> And He will see us as we are, or as we have become. May we become like Him I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of "outstanding life and contribution to society and the world."
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, "With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor."
Then my daughter exclaimed, "What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!"
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xian Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, "Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well." Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer - now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater - in Chinese, "the mother school."
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, "As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them."
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto "Go forth to serve" has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, "go forth to serve" could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of ones undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you - graduates, parents, and other supporters - thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbruck, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they dont. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests - like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesnt end, the quest doesnt end, and our relationships dont end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didnt know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: "Believe in yourself as I believe in you." It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together ("Believe in Yourself," The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is an honor to be asked to speak at this devotional. Our family has a real loyalty to Brigham Young University. My husband and I, our five children, and their spouses all graduated from BYU. As our grandchildren approach their college years, we hope they will carry on the BYU tradition.
As I thought about speaking here today, I reflected back on the days when I attended BYU - a half century ago. That makes me sound so old!
I came to BYU from a small high school; there were fewer than sixty of us in our graduating class. I hadnt traveled much. Living on a farm meant there was always work to be done, cows to milk, and water to change, so we didnt get far from home. Coming to BYU was quite an exciting adventure for me. I admit I came a little starry-eyed, with my head full of dreams, as I looked forward to more independence, new friends, and new opportunities to prepare for my future. That is probably why I was a little disappointed when the first boy to ask me out on a date was from my high school. He was also the second one to ask me out - and the third and the fourth.
I became concerned that this hometown boy would begin thinking there was more to our relationship than I thought there was, and I determined that I needed to talk to him about it. One night as he took me home from a date, I looked for just the right opportunity.
As he took me to the door, and before I could say anything, he said, "I was just wondering if you would like to go steady with me."
It had happened just as I was afraid it would, and I quickly responded, "Oh, no, I cant do that. I didnt come here to BYU to do that. I came here to date lots of guys, have fun, and meet lots of people."
As I went on and on, his eyes got wide, and, finally, when I paused to take a breath, he asked, "What did you think I just asked you?"
A little puzzled, I responded, "You asked me if I would like to go steady with you."
He shook his head and said, "No, I asked if you would like to go study with me - s-t-u-d-y. Study."
Needless to say, he never asked me out again!
I offer this advice: If anyone asks you to go study or to go steady, ask them to spell it.
As I was reading in the book of John recently, I paused to ponder the Saviors words when He said, "I am come that they [meaning you and me] might have life, and that they [you and me] might have it more abundantly."1 Everything the Savior did and said was for the benefit of humankind. His Atonement, His example, and His teachings - everything was to help us not only to have a more abundant life on earth but also to attain the most abundant of all life - even eternal life.
Today I would like to emphasize three principles the Savior taught that will lead us to live a more abundant life.
One foundational principle is seeking light and truth. The Savior blesses those who "are seeking diligently to learn w</span>
