  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="We read in Acts, chapter two, verse 17, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams."

I hesitate to mention today that I have had a dream, because doing so implies something about my age. I would rather report to you about a vision. Nevertheless, I had a dream about another talk I had to give a few months ago.

During the preparation for that talk, I awoke one morning from a dream. I had come to the pulpit in my dream to give my address. However, as I stood by the pulpit, vines began to grow all around the pulpit. They covered the pulpit like a large trellis. As I began to talk, the pulpit was faced backward. I was standing with my back to the congregation and was addressing my remarks to those sitting on the stand. As I stood there, facing backward, with vines all around me, the Orem High School marching band came into the chapel, marching up and down the aisles playing "76 Trombones." Well, I am happy to be here this morning and to see that the pulpit is facing the right way, that the plants on the stand have not grown, and that the marching band has not arrived.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Law of the Harvest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
This spring my eight-year-old son and I went through the normal spring ritual of planting a garden. It is a delightful experience. We have learned two things over the years.

First, when we plant corn seeds, we receive corn back. When we plant radish seeds, we get radishes, carrots beget carrots, etc.

Second, we also learned that whatever we planted came back in abundance. When we planted zucchini, we got lots of zucchini.

These two principles are referred to as the law of the harvest. I am grateful to Brother Frederick W. Babbel for helping me understand this concept and realize the significance of this principle of the gospel. He authored a great book entitled "&lt;i&gt;To Him That Believeth.&lt;/i&gt;"

Brother Babbel writes:

&lt;i&gt;Some people call this the Law of Cause and Effect; others call it the Law of Action and Reaction; still others call it the Law of Karma. References in the holy scriptures usually refer to it as the Law of the Harvest. This law can be named as the first law given during the creation of this earth and all form of life thereon. &lt;/i&gt;[See Genesis 1:1112, 2728.]

&lt;i&gt;Everything multiplies "after his kind." This includes plants, fruit trees, birds, fish, insects, animals, and human beings. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As we apply this principle to daily life situations, we will discern that it also applies to our thoughts, feelings, and actions. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Whatever you give to life will return to you - multiplied! This applies to our daily thoughts, feelings, and actions, be they positive or negative, uplifting or depressing. Hence, we need to make wise decisions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Because of this principle, you can make for yourself a heaven or a hell on earth. You alone must bear the responsibility for the choices you make.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who sets the standard of what forgiveness you may expect to receive? You do. (Matthew 6:1415.) If you wish to be forgiven, you must first forgive others.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who sets the standard of how you will be judged? You do. (Matthew 7:12.) Your own judgment by your Heavenly Father will be compassionate or harsh, depending upon what standard you have set in judging others.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The things you desire from life, you must first give to life. (Matthew 7:12.) What about acquiring the things you want? Like the seed planted in the ground, life can only return to you that which you first have given - with the added promise that everything you give must ultimately return to you multiplied. Perhaps that is why a sage of bygone years said a great truth, "Give to the world the best that you have and the best will come back to you." And we might add, it will be multiplied!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If you feel that you are accident-prone, or a "worry wart," or a "Why-does-this-always-happen-to-me" sort of person, you have become a victim rather than a master of this law. . . . This law can work for you as well as against you.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Job and the Law of the Harvest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Brother Babbel continues:

&lt;i&gt;In the Bible, Job is the epitome of a just and perfect man with many problems. At the beginning of his record it appears that he did not understand the implications of the Law of the Harvest.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As a young person in Sunday School, it used to bother me a great deal when our teacher related to us the story of Job and his excruciating suffering and pain. The explanation was always that we must be patient in our afflictions and sufferings, just like Job.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The rationalization was always that the devil wanted to test Job and that God gave him the privilege of literally wrecking this poor mans life and everything he had built up. I could never accept that kind of a God, one who would compromise or "make a deal" with the devil. My experience has confirmed to me that he is a God of love, a God of kindness, and a God of patience. . . . I could not conceive of his deliberately permitting this type of suffering to happen to a perfect person.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;After reading the biblical account many times, &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;I finally realized&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;i&gt; that Job tells the real cause of all his disasters in the third chapter, twenty-fifth verse: "For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me." (Job 3:25.)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In other words, Job acknowledged that he was afraid, that he was a worrier. What would he do if he lost his health? What would he do if he lost his possessions? What would he do if he lost his business? What would he do if he lost his house? What would happen if he lost some of his loved ones? What would happen if he lost his entire family? What would happen if his closest friends turned against him? Such thoughts, apparently, preyed on him continually.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The law is that the things which we think and the things which we harbor generate our feelings, and these feelings result in our acts which produce the harvest. For "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." (Galatians 6:7.) "For as &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;a man&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;i&gt; thinketh in his heart, so is he." (Proverbs 23:7.)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Since Job sowed seeds of worry, doubt, and fear, the devil had access to him and the harvest was calamitous. He lost everything but his faith in the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The things that Job was admittedly so much concerned about, came to pass. They became so unbearable that he wished that he had never been born, that he had been hidden under the greatest mountain chain so that not even God could find him or have any recollection of his existence.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But with all his problems and troubles, he did not deny God. Finally the Lord came to him and said, in effect, "Job, wake up and be a man. Dont you recall how happy you were in the morn of creation and how eagerly you looked forward to the wonderful opportunity of coming to this earth and partaking of the beauties here? Now stop whining and be a man. Gird up your loins and speak as if thou hast understanding."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When Job perceived the message and realized that he had sown the seeds of his own problems and undoing, he took on new courage. (Job 42.) He then departed from fear and desired the things which are of God. He was eager to follow the guidelines that the Lord had given him. Note how the Law of the Harvest began to work for his benefit when he changed his attitude.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The scriptures reveal that when Job realized the cause of his dilemma and asked the Lords forgiveness, his blessings were multiplied abundantly; he was rewarded two-fold in family, in friends, in flocks and herds, in health, and in all that makes for an abundant life. &lt;/i&gt;[Frederick W. Babbel, &lt;i&gt;"To Him That Believeth"&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), pp. 2529]

What are some of the seeds that we may plant in our lives? The seeds of the adversary include the following:

&lt;i&gt;Faultfinding (criticism)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Discord (quarrel)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Contention (argument)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Pride (dispute)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Envy&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Discouragement&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Disbelief (doubt)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Fear (worry, anxiety)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Anger&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Hate&lt;/i&gt;

But the seeds of our Father in Heaven would have us plant are these:

&lt;i&gt;Love&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Rejoicing (praise)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thankfulness (gratitude)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Joy&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Faith&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Patience (longsuffering)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Humility (meekness)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Harmony&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Peace&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Temperance&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Goodness&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Gentleness&lt;/i&gt;

[Babbel, p. 33]

Today I would like to add three additional seeds to this impressive and inspired list. First, that of obedience; second, repentance; and last, what I call the telephone parable, reach out and touch someone.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obedience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
An illustration of the blessings that one receives through obedience is given by this story of Abraham Smoot. As you know, the administration building bears his name.

After the hardships of Ohio, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Abraham Smoot finally was able to settle down in Salt Lake City, build comfortable accommodations for his family, and become mayor of the city. Brigham asked Brother Smoot to come to Provo and be the stake president. The Brigham Young Academy was not Church funded and was the personal responsibility of the stake president. Brother Smoot balked at the idea. "Brother Brigham, Ive put my family through so much. I have done all I was asked to do. Now, finally, I have some of the comforts of life, I have a position of respect, and I am able to provide for my family. It is too much to ask. I will not go to Provo."

At that, Brigham Young, the Lion of the Lord, is reputed to have said, "Brother Smoot, you will go to Provo, or you will go to  -  -  - !" Brother Smoot went to Provo. By the time he died, Abraham O. Smoot was deeply in debt from keeping the university functioning. His homes were mortgaged and an auction was held to settle the debts.

Jesse Knight showed up at the sale and happened to be the highest bidder on every one of the Smoot homes. He took the deeds and signed one over to each of the wives of Abraham Smoot living in the homes.

Brother Smoot demonstrated to us that by being obedient we harvest eternal blessings which are far more important than the material wealth of this life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repentance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The second seed that I would like you to plant in your life is that of repentance. I have a daughter who runs the 100-meter hurdles for Orem High School. There are 10 hurdles that she must jump in the race. The race takes about 16 seconds. In fact, some girls have run the 100-meter hurdles in 14.5 seconds. One of her goals has always been to finish the race. This young daughter has worked hard, put in many hours of practice, and has been taught correct principles in how to run hurdles. She has developed faith in herself, and she has been successful in being one of the top hurdlers in the state of Utah.

The other day I looked at the hurdles from the starting point, and it is quite an awesome sight to see those ten hurdles in straight and narrow lanes. It reminded me that eternal life is our destination, and straight and narrow is the way.

In one recent meet, my daughter hit the first hurdle, knocking her into the other lane. This disqualified her from the race. They call it being DQd. We, too, have hurdles in our way. It may be the hurdle of sin, of transgression, of reluctance, of procrastination, of pride, or of the lack of faith. We, too, have had experience, teachings, hard work, and faith. Sometimes in our life we hit hurdles and may be temporarily DQd. Unlike my daughter, however, the race is not over for us. Repentance allows us to continue.

The Savior provided for us that process of repentance. Jesus taught us the path. He personally walked that path and commanded us to follow him and do the things that he had done. Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way . . . that leadeth to salvation (see Matthew 7:14, D&amp;amp;C 132:22).

Jesus walked the path of disappointment. Remember in Luke 13:34 he said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children . . ., and ye would not!"

Jesus also walked the path of obedience. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8).

Jesus walked the path of service. "Love thy neighbor . . ." (see Luke 10:27). Jesus walked the path of prayer and taught us whom we should pray to - our Father in Heaven (Luke 11:2). And to be obedient, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). And finally he taught us to pray for others. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).

So as we move along the narrow path, it is important that we follow the Savior and his example. If we are temporarily DQd, then repentance allows us to continue on and to be successful in our lives.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Touch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The last seed I would like to plant in your life is for you to understand the importance of the human touch. Again, the Savior provided us with the proper example. "And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them" (Matthew 8:15). "Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it" (Matthew 9:29, 30). "And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him" (Luke 22:51). "And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them" (3 Nephi 18:36).

In all of these cases, the Savior was telling us that it is important to express feeling through the human touch. We visualize that when we see a new baby with its mother or when we see an engaged couple holding hands or a father and son wrestling on the living room floor. President Holland is a touch person. President Kimball also emulates that trait. Other examples of the human touch include a handshake, a pat on the back, or a hug. "A hug says it all and makes both the hugger and the huggee feel terrific" (&lt;i&gt;Family Circle,&lt;/i&gt;28 April 1981, p. 79). Let me identify a few occasions where giving a hug would be appropriate:

&lt;i&gt;Your kids say, "Wow! Leftovers!"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your father insists, "I like to wallpaper ceilings."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You change your hair color and your husband not only notices, he whistles.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your seven-year-old turns off the TV and says, "I just feel like reading a book."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your thirteen-year-old daughter sits down to write a thank-you note - with no prompting.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You find your husband - who started out to clean the attic - dreamily looking at your old wedding album.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your husband looks at the ruined fender, then at you, and asks, "Are you sure youre all right?"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your son comes home from college with a haircut.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your teenage son borrows the car and returns it with a full tank.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your teenage daughter calls at midnight to say the partys gotten out of hand, and would you come to pick her up?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your two-year-old asks you to marry her.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your husband says "Im sorry" even though you know its just as much your fault.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The puppy is trained at last.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your husband does the dishes - and the pots.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Your nine-year-olds Little League team loses 32 in an extra inning.&lt;/i&gt;

[Mary Mobler, "Fifty Reasons to Give a Hug," &lt;i&gt;Family Circle, &lt;/i&gt;28 April 1981, p. 79]

The human touch conveys so many emotions.

We recently had a family home evening where the opposite of this principle was taught. Each of us had a tag on a piece of string around our necks. During the day, when any one of us said anything negative to another, we would tear a little of that persons tag, indicating that what the offender had done was to give negative rather than positive reinforcement.

So often we do the opposite of what the Savior has taught by tearing each others tags. For example, when I say to my children, "Why do you do those dumb things?" "You cant do that," "Dont be silly," or "You dummy," I convey a negative connotation to my children. That is, I "tear their tags."

Each morning, as I would awaken my eight-year-old son, I would say, "Look in the mirror and see the monkey." And then he would stop at the landing, and again I would say, "Look in the mirror and see the monkey." And finally, in the bathroom, I would tear his tag again by saying, "Look at the monkey in the mirror." I didnt realize that I was "tearing his tag" until one day at family prayer he said, "Please, Father in Heaven, make it so my Daddy doesnt call me a monkey anymore." Now when we look in the mirror I say, "Look at that neat kid with his handsome father." How often do we tear each others tags rather than follow the example of lifting through the human touch?

My older son, who is currently serving a mission, told me of an experience he had while he worked as a disc jockey for K-96. He worked the two till six a.m. shift. One evening he received a phone call from a BYU coed who was not a member of the Church. He could sense that she was distraught and very emotional. She wanted to know the phone number of the Crisis Center since she said, "I am contemplating suicide."

It seems that her roommates had never invited her to church meetings or activities. They had meant well by honoring her own beliefs, but in the process had forgotten to include her, had forgotten to reach out and touch her. They had not been harsh or mean, but, at the same time, their "neutral" position had not built or sustained a relationship. She felt so alone and unloved.

He was able to keep her on the telephone, telling her about the gospel and about the Savior, only occasionally breaking off to do the necessary station identification. As the sun started to peek over Timpanogos, only then was she able to bring her emotions under control. His two-hour conversation helped put her life into perspective. He had reached out and touched her.

How many young people are there who have their tags torn, unable really to experience the joy that comes from the human touch? Children seem to understand this concept so much better than those of us who are called adults.

My wife teaches second grade at Rock Canyon School. One of her students this year was somewhat of an outcast. He was different. He had a difficult time writing. He had a difficult time expressing his emotions.

The class members, under my wifes tutelage, learned that they could help him. She would use pats on the back and hugs as positive reinforcement. Whenever this young man achieved, the entire class would applaud.

It seems that children are always able to respond openly and honestly in terms of their feelings. I asked my young son one time if he was going to become an Eagle like his brother. After much thought he replied, "Nope, I think Id rather be a duck." One young second grade student responded the following way when asked to name the four seasons: "Duck, deer, fishing, pheasant." He received full credit since his answer conveyed a loving relationship with a committed father.

Let me further illustrate this caring concept with the following stories.

Elaine and Dave arrived at the hotel exhausted. Elaine had made all the arrangements for the room and the concert they planned to attend, and she let Dave know about it all the way, telling him how hard shed worked to coordinate everything.

Then - horrors! - they walked up to the desk and the hotel manager told them they had no reservations. He pulled out the letter Elaine had written and proved he was right.

"I had put down the wrong dates," she groaned. "And having been so full of myself, I thought for sure Dave would give it to me."

What Dave gave her instead was a hug. "Honey," he said, "dont worry. Well find something else." It dawned on Elaine that she had married the kind of person who never hits you when youre down. "I think of that whenever I start complaining to myself about all that Dave isnt. It reminds me that Ive picked the right person."

&lt;i&gt;Soon after their sixth anniversary, . . . Angi and Davids home burned to the ground. Angis first act, when they were allowed to hunt through the blackened remains, was to search for their very precious photograph albums. And when she went to tell David the news that the pictures indeed had survived, she found him kneeling in ashes to rescue, and carefully place in a box, some charred, folded pieces of paper - their courtship love letters.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"As I watched David there in the ashes," she &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;says&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;i&gt;, "I was overcome with the certainty that we were meant for one another. There, in the face of our greatest tragedy, our first thoughts were not of our material loss but of the potential loss of these precious parts of ourselves and of our life together. As I knelt to help him with the letters, I was certain that we hadnt lost anything that mattered after all." &lt;/i&gt;[Judith Viorst, "True Love Stories," &lt;i&gt;Redbook,&lt;/i&gt; February 1982, p. 38]

We have developed a game that we play in our home called "Touched You Last." Most nights, as we tuck the children in bed, we play this fun game. One night, after we all had been in bed for a few minutes and the lights were out, my daughter got out of her bed and in the dark crawled quietly on her hands and knees from her room down the hall into our room. She crawled to my side of the bed, reached up and said, "Touched you last." I want you to know that my heart is okay.

Last spring, our golden retriever, Duchess, had seven brand-new puppies. One day, when the puppies were about five weeks old, I brought the puppies to the Tanner Building so the secretaries could see them.

While I was here on campus, I took them out on the east side of the Tanner Building and let them run around on the patio area which leads down to Helaman Halls. It was a neat experience to watch these mature, scholarly students as they would stop to play with the puppies. Everyone who stopped got down on their hands and knees and played with the puppies, allowing the little dogs to kiss them.

It was great to see these college students "reach out and touch" and extend love to little warm puppies. Surely the Peanuts character, Charlie Brown, was right when he said, "Happiness is a warm puppy."

Today I have told you that whatever a person soweth, so shall he or she reap. This is the law of the harvest. Also, Ive said that we have within our grasp the full potential for our own happiness. It is really up to us. As we are obedient to the principles of the gospel and as we put our lives in order, through repentance, we can then "reach out and touch someone."

Finally, let me end with a short story written by one of my wifes students. The story illustrates the seed and essence of happiness.

&lt;i&gt;If I found some gold and jewels, I would share with my family. I would buy my mom a new car, some clothes, and a new house. My sister some clothes. And a Cabbage Patch for Jane, my sister. Now my brother some new clothes, a car for Jim. For Jack which he thinks he is the king, because he gets everything he wants, I would get him some clothes. Now for my dad anything he wants. My grandma and grandpa I would give them some money. And what do I get! Do you think I need some money? You do, oh! I dont think so. Because I shared with my family and it made me happy. And so I was the richest in the world.&lt;/i&gt;

May we plant in our lives the seed of obedience to the gospel principles, the seed of repentance, and the seed of the human touch so that our harvest is one of happiness and joy. My brothers and sisters, I bear testimony to you of the divinity of the Savior Jesus Christ. As we follow his example we will secure joy and harvest the happiness we all so desire. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>We read in Acts, chapter two, verse 17, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams."</p>
<p>I hesitate to mention today that I have had a dream, because doing so implies something about my age. I would rather report to you about a vision. Nevertheless, I had a dream about another talk I had to give a few months ago.</p>
<p>During the preparation for that talk, I awoke one morning from a dream. I had come to the pulpit in my dream to give my address. However, as I stood by the pulpit, vines began to grow all around the pulpit. They covered the pulpit like a large trellis. As I began to talk, the pulpit was faced backward. I was standing with my back to the congregation and was addressing my remarks to those sitting on the stand. As I stood there, facing backward, with vines all around me, the Orem High School marching band came into the chapel, marching up and down the aisles playing "76 Trombones." Well, I am happy to be here this morning and to see that the pulpit is facing the right way, that the plants on the stand have not grown, and that the marching band has not arrived.</p>
<h2><b>Law of the Harvest</b></h2>
<p>This spring my eight-year-old son and I went through the normal spring ritual of planting a garden. It is a delightful experience. We have learned two things over the years.</p>
<p>First, when we plant corn seeds, we receive corn back. When we plant radish seeds, we get radishes, carrots beget carrots, etc.</p>
<p>Second, we also learned that whatever we planted came back in abundance. When we planted zucchini, we got lots of zucchini.</p>
<p>These two principles are referred to as the law of the harvest. I am grateful to Brother Frederick W. Babbel for helping me understand this concept and realize the significance of this principle of the gospel. He authored a great book entitled "<i>To Him That Believeth.</i>"</p>
<p>Brother Babbel writes:</p>
<p><i>Some people call this the Law of Cause and Effect; others call it the Law of Action and Reaction; still others call it the Law of Karma. References in the holy scriptures usually refer to it as the Law of the Harvest. This law can be named as the first law given during the creation of this earth and all form of life thereon. </i>[See Genesis 1:1112, 2728.]</p>
<p><i>Everything multiplies "after his kind." This includes plants, fruit trees, birds, fish, insects, animals, and human beings. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>As we apply this principle to daily life situations, we will discern that it also applies to our thoughts, feelings, and actions. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Whatever you give to life will return to you - multiplied! This applies to our daily thoughts, feelings, and actions, be they positive or negative, uplifting or depressing. Hence, we need to make wise decisions.</i></p>
<p><i>Because of this principle, you can make for yourself a heaven or a hell on earth. You alone must bear the responsibility for the choices you make.</i></p>
<p><i>Who sets the standard of what forgiveness you may expect to receive? You do. (Matthew 6:1415.) If you wish to be forgiven, you must first forgive others.</i></p>
<p><i>Who sets the standard of how you will be judged? You do. (Matthew 7:12.) Your own judgment by your Heavenly Father will be compassionate or harsh, depending upon what standard you have set in judging others.</i></p>
<p><i>The things you desire from life, you must first give to life. (Matthew 7:12.) What about acquiring the things you want? Like the seed planted in the ground, life can only return to you that which you first have given - with the added promise that everything you give must ultimately return to you multiplied. Perhaps that is why a sage of bygone years said a great truth, "Give to the world the best that you have and the best will come back to you." And we might add, it will be multiplied!</i></p>
<p><i>If you feel that you are accident-prone, or a "worry wart," or a "Why-does-this-always-happen-to-me" sort of person, you have become a victim rather than a master of this law. . . . This law can work for you as well as against you.</i></p>
<h2><b>Job and the Law of the Harvest</b></h2>
<p>Brother Babbel continues:</p>
<p><i>In the Bible, Job is the epitome of a just and perfect man with many problems. At the beginning of his record it appears that he did not understand the implications of the Law of the Harvest.</i></p>
<p><i>As a young person in Sunday School, it used to bother me a great deal when our teacher related to us the story of Job and his excruciating suffering and pain. The explanation was always that we must be patient in our afflictions and sufferings, just like Job.</i></p>
<p><i>The rationalization was always that the devil wanted to test Job and that God gave him the privilege of literally wrecking this poor mans life and everything he had built up. I could never accept that kind of a God, one who would compromise or "make a deal" with the devil. My experience has confirmed to me that he is a God of love, a God of kindness, and a God of patience. . . . I could not conceive of his deliberately permitting this type of suffering to happen to a perfect person.</i></p>
<p><i>After reading the biblical account many times, </i>[<i>I finally realized</i>]<i> that Job tells the real cause of all his disasters in the third chapter, twenty-fifth verse: "For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me." (Job 3:25.)</i></p>
<p><i>In other words, Job acknowledged that he was afraid, that he was a worrier. What would he do if he lost his health? What would he do if he lost his possessions? What would he do if he lost his business? What would he do if he lost his house? What would happen if he lost some of his loved ones? What would happen if he lost his entire family? What would happen if his closest friends turned against him? Such thoughts, apparently, preyed on him continually.</i></p>
<p><i>The law is that the things which we think and the things which we harbor generate our feelings, and these feelings result in our acts which produce the harvest. For "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." (Galatians 6:7.) "For as </i>[<i>a man</i>]<i> thinketh in his heart, so is he." (Proverbs 23:7.)</i></p>
<p><i>Since Job sowed seeds of worry, doubt, and fear, the devil had access to him and the harvest was calamitous. He lost everything but his faith in the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>The things that Job was admittedly so much concerned about, came to pass. They became so unbearable that he wished that he had never been born, that he had been hidden under the greatest mountain chain so that not even God could find him or have any recollection of his existence.</i></p>
<p><i>But with all his problems and troubles, he did not deny God. Finally the Lord came to him and said, in effect, "Job, wake up and be a man. Dont you recall how happy you were in the morn of creation and how eagerly you looked forward to the wonderful opportunity of coming to this earth and partaking of the beauties here? Now stop whining and be a man. Gird up your loins and speak as if thou hast understanding."</i></p>
<p><i>When Job perceived the message and realized that he had sown the seeds of his own problems and undoing, he took on new courage. (Job 42.) He then departed from fear and desired the things which are of God. He was eager to follow the guidelines that the Lord had given him. Note how the Law of the Harvest began to work for his benefit when he changed his attitude.</i></p>
<p><i>The scriptures reveal that when Job realized the cause of his dilemma and asked the Lords forgiveness, his blessings were multiplied abundantly; he was rewarded two-fold in family, in friends, in flocks and herds, in health, and in all that makes for an abundant life. </i>[Frederick W. Babbel, <i>"To Him That Believeth"</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), pp. 2529]</p>
<p>What are some of the seeds that we may plant in our lives? The seeds of the adversary include the following:</p>
<p><i>Faultfinding (criticism)</i></p>
<p><i>Discord (quarrel)</i></p>
<p><i>Contention (argument)</i></p>
<p><i>Pride (dispute)</i></p>
<p><i>Envy</i></p>
<p><i>Discouragement</i></p>
<p><i>Disbelief (doubt)</i></p>
<p><i>Fear (worry, anxiety)</i></p>
<p><i>Anger</i></p>
<p><i>Hate</i></p>
<p>But the seeds of our Father in Heaven would have us plant are these:</p>
<p><i>Love</i></p>
<p><i>Rejoicing (praise)</i></p>
<p><i>Thankfulness (gratitude)</i></p>
<p><i>Joy</i></p>
<p><i>Faith</i></p>
<p><i>Forgiveness</i></p>
<p><i>Patience (longsuffering)</i></p>
<p><i>Humility (meekness)</i></p>
<p><i>Harmony</i></p>
<p><i>Peace</i></p>
<p><i>Temperance</i></p>
<p><i>Goodness</i></p>
<p><i>Gentleness</i></p>
<p>[Babbel, p. 33]</p>
<p>Today I would like to add three additional seeds to this impressive and inspired list. First, that of obedience; second, repentance; and last, what I call the telephone parable, reach out and touch someone.</p>
<h2><b>Obedience</b></h2>
<p>An illustration of the blessings that one receives through obedience is given by this story of Abraham Smoot. As you know, the administration building bears his name.</p>
<p>After the hardships of Ohio, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Abraham Smoot finally was able to settle down in Salt Lake City, build comfortable accommodations for his family, and become mayor of the city. Brigham asked Brother Smoot to come to Provo and be the stake president. The Brigham Young Academy was not Church funded and was the personal responsibility of the stake president. Brother Smoot balked at the idea. "Brother Brigham, Ive put my family through so much. I have done all I was asked to do. Now, finally, I have some of the comforts of life, I have a position of respect, and I am able to provide for my family. It is too much to ask. I will not go to Provo."</p>
<p>At that, Brigham Young, the Lion of the Lord, is reputed to have said, "Brother Smoot, you will go to Provo, or you will go to  -  -  - !" Brother Smoot went to Provo. By the time he died, Abraham O. Smoot was deeply in debt from keeping the university functioning. His homes were mortgaged and an auction was held to settle the debts.</p>
<p>Jesse Knight showed up at the sale and happened to be the highest bidder on every one of the Smoot homes. He took the deeds and signed one over to each of the wives of Abraham Smoot living in the homes.</p>
<p>Brother Smoot demonstrated to us that by being obedient we harvest eternal blessings which are far more important than the material wealth of this life.</p>
<h2><b>Repentance</b></h2>
<p>The second seed that I would like you to plant in your life is that of repentance. I have a daughter who runs the 100-meter hurdles for Orem High School. There are 10 hurdles that she must jump in the race. The race takes about 16 seconds. In fact, some girls have run the 100-meter hurdles in 14.5 seconds. One of her goals has always been to finish the race. This young daughter has worked hard, put in many hours of practice, and has been taught correct principles in how to run hurdles. She has developed faith in herself, and she has been successful in being one of the top hurdlers in the state of Utah.</p>
<p>The other day I looked at the hurdles from the starting point, and it is quite an awesome sight to see those ten hurdles in straight and narrow lanes. It reminded me that eternal life is our destination, and straight and narrow is the way.</p>
<p>In one recent meet, my daughter hit the first hurdle, knocking her into the other lane. This disqualified her from the race. They call it being DQd. We, too, have hurdles in our way. It may be the hurdle of sin, of transgression, of reluctance, of procrastination, of pride, or of the lack of faith. We, too, have had experience, teachings, hard work, and faith. Sometimes in our life we hit hurdles and may be temporarily DQd. Unlike my daughter, however, the race is not over for us. Repentance allows us to continue.</p>
<p>The Savior provided for us that process of repentance. Jesus taught us the path. He personally walked that path and commanded us to follow him and do the things that he had done. Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way . . . that leadeth to salvation (see Matthew 7:14, D&amp;C 132:22).</p>
<p>Jesus walked the path of disappointment. Remember in Luke 13:34 he said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children . . ., and ye would not!"</p>
<p>Jesus also walked the path of obedience. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8).</p>
<p>Jesus walked the path of service. "Love thy neighbor . . ." (see Luke 10:27). Jesus walked the path of prayer and taught us whom we should pray to - our Father in Heaven (Luke 11:2). And to be obedient, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). And finally he taught us to pray for others. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).</p>
<p>So as we move along the narrow path, it is important that we follow the Savior and his example. If we are temporarily DQd, then repentance allows us to continue on and to be successful in our lives.</p>
<h2><b>Human Touch</b></h2>
<p>The last seed I would like to plant in your life is for you to understand the importance of the human touch. Again, the Savior provided us with the proper example. "And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them" (Matthew 8:15). "Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it" (Matthew 9:29, 30). "And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him" (Luke 22:51). "And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them" (3 Nephi 18:36).</p>
<p>In all of these cases, the Savior was telling us that it is important to express feeling through the human touch. We visualize that when we see a new baby with its mother or when we see an engaged couple holding hands or a father and son wrestling on the living room floor. President Holland is a touch person. President Kimball also emulates that trait. Other examples of the human touch include a handshake, a pat on the back, or a hug. "A hug says it all and makes both the hugger and the huggee feel terrific" (<i>Family Circle,</i>28 April 1981, p. 79). Let me identify a few occasions where giving a hug would be appropriate:</p>
<p><i>Your kids say, "Wow! Leftovers!"</i></p>
<p><i>Your father insists, "I like to wallpaper ceilings."</i></p>
<p><i>You change your hair color and your husband not only notices, he whistles.</i></p>
<p><i>Your seven-year-old turns off the TV and says, "I just feel like reading a book."</i></p>
<p><i>Your thirteen-year-old daughter sits down to write a thank-you note - with no prompting.</i></p>
<p><i>You find your husband - who started out to clean the attic - dreamily looking at your old wedding album.</i></p>
<p><i>Your husband looks at the ruined fender, then at you, and asks, "Are you sure youre all right?"</i></p>
<p><i>Your son comes home from college with a haircut.</i></p>
<p><i>Your teenage son borrows the car and returns it with a full tank.</i></p>
<p><i>Your teenage daughter calls at midnight to say the partys gotten out of hand, and would you come to pick her up?</i></p>
<p><i>Your two-year-old asks you to marry her.</i></p>
<p><i>Your husband says "Im sorry" even though you know its just as much your fault.</i></p>
<p><i>The puppy is trained at last.</i></p>
<p><i>Your husband does the dishes - and the pots.</i></p>
<p><i>Your nine-year-olds Little League team loses 32 in an extra inning.</i></p>
<p>[Mary Mobler, "Fifty Reasons to Give a Hug," <i>Family Circle, </i>28 April 1981, p. 79]</p>
<p>The human touch conveys so many emotions.</p>
<p>We recently had a family home evening where the opposite of this principle was taught. Each of us had a tag on a piece of string around our necks. During the day, when any one of us said anything negative to another, we would tear a little of that persons tag, indicating that what the offender had done was to give negative rather than positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>So often we do the opposite of what the Savior has taught by tearing each others tags. For example, when I say to my children, "Why do you do those dumb things?" "You cant do that," "Dont be silly," or "You dummy," I convey a negative connotation to my children. That is, I "tear their tags."</p>
<p>Each morning, as I would awaken my eight-year-old son, I would say, "Look in the mirror and see the monkey." And then he would stop at the landing, and again I would say, "Look in the mirror and see the monkey." And finally, in the bathroom, I would tear his tag again by saying, "Look at the monkey in the mirror." I didnt realize that I was "tearing his tag" until one day at family prayer he said, "Please, Father in Heaven, make it so my Daddy doesnt call me a monkey anymore." Now when we look in the mirror I say, "Look at that neat kid with his handsome father." How often do we tear each others tags rather than follow the example of lifting through the human touch?</p>
<p>My older son, who is currently serving a mission, told me of an experience he had while he worked as a disc jockey for K-96. He worked the two till six a.m. shift. One evening he received a phone call from a BYU coed who was not a member of the Church. He could sense that she was distraught and very emotional. She wanted to know the phone number of the Crisis Center since she said, "I am contemplating suicide."</p>
<p>It seems that her roommates had never invited her to church meetings or activities. They had meant well by honoring her own beliefs, but in the process had forgotten to include her, had forgotten to reach out and touch her. They had not been harsh or mean, but, at the same time, their "neutral" position had not built or sustained a relationship. She felt so alone and unloved.</p>
<p>He was able to keep her on the telephone, telling her about the gospel and about the Savior, only occasionally breaking off to do the necessary station identification. As the sun started to peek over Timpanogos, only then was she able to bring her emotions under control. His two-hour conversation helped put her life into perspective. He had reached out and touched her.</p>
<p>How many young people are there who have their tags torn, unable really to experience the joy that comes from the human touch? Children seem to understand this concept so much better than those of us who are called adults.</p>
<p>My wife teaches second grade at Rock Canyon School. One of her students this year was somewhat of an outcast. He was different. He had a difficult time writing. He had a difficult time expressing his emotions.</p>
<p>The class members, under my wifes tutelage, learned that they could help him. She would use pats on the back and hugs as positive reinforcement. Whenever this young man achieved, the entire class would applaud.</p>
<p>It seems that children are always able to respond openly and honestly in terms of their feelings. I asked my young son one time if he was going to become an Eagle like his brother. After much thought he replied, "Nope, I think Id rather be a duck." One young second grade student responded the following way when asked to name the four seasons: "Duck, deer, fishing, pheasant." He received full credit since his answer conveyed a loving relationship with a committed father.</p>
<p>Let me further illustrate this caring concept with the following stories.</p>
<p>Elaine and Dave arrived at the hotel exhausted. Elaine had made all the arrangements for the room and the concert they planned to attend, and she let Dave know about it all the way, telling him how hard shed worked to coordinate everything.</p>
<p>Then - horrors! - they walked up to the desk and the hotel manager told them they had no reservations. He pulled out the letter Elaine had written and proved he was right.</p>
<p>"I had put down the wrong dates," she groaned. "And having been so full of myself, I thought for sure Dave would give it to me."</p>
<p>What Dave gave her instead was a hug. "Honey," he said, "dont worry. Well find something else." It dawned on Elaine that she had married the kind of person who never hits you when youre down. "I think of that whenever I start complaining to myself about all that Dave isnt. It reminds me that Ive picked the right person."</p>
<p><i>Soon after their sixth anniversary, . . . Angi and Davids home burned to the ground. Angis first act, when they were allowed to hunt through the blackened remains, was to search for their very precious photograph albums. And when she went to tell David the news that the pictures indeed had survived, she found him kneeling in ashes to rescue, and carefully place in a box, some charred, folded pieces of paper - their courtship love letters.</i></p>
<p><i>"As I watched David there in the ashes," she </i>[<i>says</i>]<i>, "I was overcome with the certainty that we were meant for one another. There, in the face of our greatest tragedy, our first thoughts were not of our material loss but of the potential loss of these precious parts of ourselves and of our life together. As I knelt to help him with the letters, I was certain that we hadnt lost anything that mattered after all." </i>[Judith Viorst, "True Love Stories," <i>Redbook,</i> February 1982, p. 38]</p>
<p>We have developed a game that we play in our home called "Touched You Last." Most nights, as we tuck the children in bed, we play this fun game. One night, after we all had been in bed for a few minutes and the lights were out, my daughter got out of her bed and in the dark crawled quietly on her hands and knees from her room down the hall into our room. She crawled to my side of the bed, reached up and said, "Touched you last." I want you to know that my heart is okay.</p>
<p>Last spring, our golden retriever, Duchess, had seven brand-new puppies. One day, when the puppies were about five weeks old, I brought the puppies to the Tanner Building so the secretaries could see them.</p>
<p>While I was here on campus, I took them out on the east side of the Tanner Building and let them run around on the patio area which leads down to Helaman Halls. It was a neat experience to watch these mature, scholarly students as they would stop to play with the puppies. Everyone who stopped got down on their hands and knees and played with the puppies, allowing the little dogs to kiss them.</p>
<p>It was great to see these college students "reach out and touch" and extend love to little warm puppies. Surely the Peanuts character, Charlie Brown, was right when he said, "Happiness is a warm puppy."</p>
<p>Today I have told you that whatever a person soweth, so shall he or she reap. This is the law of the harvest. Also, Ive said that we have within our grasp the full potential for our own happiness. It is really up to us. As we are obedient to the principles of the gospel and as we put our lives in order, through repentance, we can then "reach out and touch someone."</p>
<p>Finally, let me end with a short story written by one of my wifes students. The story illustrates the seed and essence of happiness.</p>
<p><i>If I found some gold and jewels, I would share with my family. I would buy my mom a new car, some clothes, and a new house. My sister some clothes. And a Cabbage Patch for Jane, my sister. Now my brother some new clothes, a car for Jim. For Jack which he thinks he is the king, because he gets everything he wants, I would get him some clothes. Now for my dad anything he wants. My grandma and grandpa I would give them some money. And what do I get! Do you think I need some money? You do, oh! I dont think so. Because I shared with my family and it made me happy. And so I was the richest in the world.</i></p>
<p>May we plant in our lives the seed of obedience to the gospel principles, the seed of repentance, and the seed of the human touch so that our harvest is one of happiness and joy. My brothers and sisters, I bear testimony to you of the divinity of the Savior Jesus Christ. As we follow his example we will secure joy and harvest the happiness we all so desire. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am honored to have the chance to speak to you today.
As you probably know, we are under attack by hackers and others seeking to steal our online identities or information. Some attacks in the news recently included Target, Home Depot, Sony, and the IRS. In one of the largest attacks, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management reported the theft of sensitive information from twenty-two million people - virtually anyone who had undergone a government background check in the last fifteen years. In addition, there are lots of online scams just waiting to trap us.
We are also under spiritual attack. As stated in 2 Nephi 2:27, Satan and his followers are doing everything that is possible to make us "miserable like unto" them. Brigham Young said:
It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise.1
Recently President Thomas S. Monson stated, "Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and its growing ever wider."2 However, as threatening as this may seem, we also have been promised spiritual protection. Today I am going to speak about some ways to improve our computer-security behavior, and I am going to offer some spiritual-behavior tips to keep us safe spiritually. While neither of these lists is complete, they are a good place to start.
Security Warnings and Habituation
As was mentioned, I am a professor in the Information Systems Department. I do research at the intersection of neuroscience and behavioral information security. Basically, my research team and I study what is going on in peoples brains when they are interacting with security messages.
We have discovered some interesting things about how and why people behave the way they do in a computer-security setting. Our research shows that when computer users are exposed to a security message more than once, on the second - and on any following - repetition, the brain saves energy by relying on memory rather than visually processing that security message on subsequent viewings.
The region at the back of the brain, called the occipital lobe, is responsible for visual processing and is one of the main areas in which we saw a decreased response over the repetitions. As you can guess, this is problematic because we are tuning out these messages without really seeing them. We have developed some variations on the security messages, and these variations cause the computer users brains to pay attention. In this way - working with biology instead of against it - we can make users more secure by changing the software rather than by increasing the training for users.
In a sense, this habituation to se</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Let me begin by relating an obscure historical event, and then I will draw out some lessons that can be learned from this remote maritime misfortune.
In the early seventeenth century, Sweden was a world power. Swedens king, Gustav II Adolf, commissioned a warship that would be christened the Vasa. The ship represented a substantial outlay of resources, particularly the oak from which the vessel would be built. Oak was so valuable that cutting down an oak tree without authorization was a capital offense. Gustav Adolf closely oversaw the construction process, attempting to ensure that the Vasa would fully realize his expectations.
After construction had begun, Gustav Adolf ordered the Vasa to be made longer. Because the width supports had already been built from precious oak, the king directed the builders to increase the ships length without increasing its width. Although the shipwrights knew that doing so would compromise the Vasas seaworthiness, they were hesitant to tell the king something they knew he did not want to hear. They complied. Gustav Adolf also insisted that this ship have not simply the customary single deck of guns but cannons on three decks, with the heaviest cannons on the upper deck. Again, against their better judgment, the shipwrights complied.
Over the course of several years, shipwrights, carpenters, rope makers, and others worked diligently to build the Vasa. Over one thousand oak trees were used to complete the ship. It had sixty-four cannons and masts taller than 150 feet. To give the ship the opulence befitting a kings flagship, several hundred gilded and painted sculptures were added.
On August 10, 1628, the Vasa began its maiden voyage. In view of countless spectators, the ship left its mooring directly below the royal castle in Stockholm. After being pulled along by anchors for the first several hundred feet, the Vasa left the shelter of the harbor. A stronger wind entered its sails, and the ship began to tip. The Vasa righted itself slightly, but only temporarily. Before long, as recorded by an observer, "she heeled right over and water gushed in through the gun ports until she slowly went to the bottom under sail, pennants and all."1 The Vasas maiden voyage was about 4,200 feet.
The Vasa rested at the bottom of the Baltic Sea until it was recovered three centuries later in 1961. It was successfully raised from the seabed and towed back to Stockholm. Today the Vasa rests in a temperature- and humidity-controlled museum in Djurgarden, an island in central Stockholm. I have a model of the ship in my office at Church headquarters as a reminder of several lessons that underlie its short, tragic history.
Despite the Vasas magnificent appearance, the ship was not seaworthy. The alterations in its construction resulted in it not having sufficient lateral stabilit</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Its wonderful to be with you this morning on the BYU campus. Before I share with you my prepared remarks, I have just a couple of thoughts I would like to express. First of all, thank you for that lovely choir that has come together with a beautiful hymn. I felt of the Spirit, and I pray the Spirit will continue as we meet here today.
I just returned a few days ago from an assignment in the South Pacific, where I had stake conferences and trained temple workers in the islands of Fiji and Tonga and visited missionaries in the New Zealand Wellington Mission. I wish I could take you there and let you feel of the faith of these wonderful Saints of the islands, and I wish I could bring them here to see the opportunities that you have. We would both benefit from that. The Church is doing well in those islands, but there are great challenges. They dont have near the opportunities and privileges that you have - especially for education. But how blessed you are and how blessed they are to do what they can in the circumstances that they have.
Second, the last almost six years I have been a member of the Church Board of Education, which includes the Board of Trustees for Brigham Young University here at Provo and for the other Church Educational System institutions. I meet every other week with the executive board, which consists of two members of the Twelve and the Church commissioner, and then every month we meet with the First Presidency as the Board of Trustees. I just want you to know how much these Brethren love you and how concerned they are that you get a good education, that you are happy, that you are doing well, that you are physically healthy and strong, and that you are achieving what you desire to achieve here at this university.
This is a remarkable university. President Cecil Samuelson is one of my esteemed Brethren of the Seventy, and we served together in the presidency for several years before he was called to this position. So its a wonderful privilege to be back here. Im also grateful for Brother John Tanner, one of your great vice presidents who does all that he does so very well.
Now, what I would like to do today is to share with you a beautiful parable. Most of the parables are found in the New Testament, where Jesus taught with such beauty and simplicity; however, the parable I would like to share is found in the Doctrine and Covenants and was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland in 1833. It is the parable of the watchman on the tower:
A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and plant twelve olive-trees;
And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive-trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As always at this time of year, I look forward to welcoming each of you to campus and the start of what we anticipate will be a wonderful, productive, and enriching new academic year. We are grateful to have each of you: those who are here for the first time, those who are continuing, and those who are returning after missions or other endeavors elsewhere. It is good to be in your company.
If I were a student, which I try to be, I would now be entering my senior year at BYU. I have been generally delighted by my experiences and hope that this is your lot as well. BYU is wonderful. It is also a big, complicated, and sometimes intimidating place. I am grateful to so many who go out of their way to be friendly and extend greetings as we pass each other on the campus. I hope that all of you will make special efforts to reach out and befriend your new associates. Some of you come with already made friends and previous contacts. While these relationships will and should continue, I hope and ask that all of you will consciously seek to broaden your circles, meet new friends, and always be friendly and courteous to everyone you encounter. This is part of what BYU is and should be.
We must never forget that BYU is not just another "good" university. It was established by the Lords servants and continues to be blessed with the direction and support of prophets, seers, and revelators. While we may not understand all of the details, we do know that Brigham Young University occupies a key place in the Lords plans for the completion of His work in these last days.
Because there is so much that is good and praiseworthy here at BYU, and because almost all of you are so good and praiseworthy, it is a great temptation to spend our limited time together in complimentary expressions. These are in order, and I do express my deep and profound appreciation and admiration for so much and to so many of you, especially those who make the BYU experience possible: the faithful tithe payers of the Church, your loyal families and supporting friends, our generous supporters and donors, and others who contribute in so many ways.
As I do so, however, I also feel impressed to share with you some reflections of admonition that accompany my appreciation and admiration. I listen to and read with deep interest the comments that many in our community make and those that are shared by people who mainly love and care about BYU and you. You would not be surprised that in my responsibilities I receive significant input. My e-mail and letter boxes are often quite full, and in my meetings and question-and-answer sessions with students, faculty, staff, and administrative colleagues, as well as with alumni, community groups, university supporters, and Church leaders, I am provided with volumes of feedback, suggestions, and occasional criticisms. Almost all are constructive and well-meaning, although there is occasional evidence of a little carping, lac</span>
