  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am  grateful for the opportunity to speak today. The weekly devotionals and forums have been a big part of my BYU experience. I attended them when I was a  student, and my wife and I still attend them with our children who are students here. I am also grateful to my family, friends, and colleagues who have  taken the time to be with us today.

Today is my father’s birthday. He is eighty-seven years old. He and my mother are in Wisconsin watching this  devotional, and if the volume on the television is turned all the way up, they are listening to it too.

My father’s name is Gordon Smith. My  mother told me recently—and she reminds me often—that my father never wanted a son named Gordon, but he agreed to give me his first name as my middle name.  This is the story about why I took that name upon myself and why I have come to believe that the names we call each other are important.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why I Took My  Father’s Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
To understand why I took my father’s name as my own, you need to know a bit about my relationship with my father. My father and  several generations before him had been dairy farmers in Wisconsin, but in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, my father, only seventeen years  old at the time, joined the navy and was assigned to serve in the South Pacific. He eventually made a career of the military, and I was born in a naval  hospital in Bremerton, Washington. Shortly after my birth he was transferred to San Diego, California, where he taught Teletype repair for five years.  Following his retirement our family returned to his childhood home of Wisconsin, and that’s where I grew up. Many of my earliest memories involve feeding  and caring for cows, pigs, and chickens on our small farm, though I was temperamentally not well suited to farming.

My uneasy relationship with  farming became apparent to our whole family when our pigs disappeared. Our pigs were named Slurp and Burp. One day they were just gone, and I asked around,  “Where did Slurp and Burp go?” Nobody else seemed troubled by their disappearance. They just said that somebody had come and taken them away.

A  few weeks later, over a dinner featuring pork chops, my older sister—who introduced so much of life to me—said, pointing at my plate, “Remember Slurp and  Burp?”

Lessons about the circle of life were plentiful on that small farm. I saw my father assist in the birthing of a calf, and we drank milk  from the calf’s mother. I was playing basketball in the yard one day when a rabid raccoon came toward me, and my dad shot the raccoon. (At first I was  worried I had been in trouble, and I thought he had just missed.) We learned by observation that chickens do indeed come from eggs, and we also learned by  observation what it means to “run around like a chicken with its head cut off.”

Despite our humble and remote circumstances, I managed to  cultivate big dreams on that farm, in no small part because of my dad. During his last year of service in the navy he traveled the world and sent us  souvenirs from Europe, Asia, and Africa. He was gone for a year, and I remember that when he returned, I didn’t know what he looked like because I was only  four years old when he left and five when he returned. But I treasured those souvenirs that he sent me, and I spent many hours in my room in Wisconsin  looking at photos of Rome or pounding on a drum from Africa or playing with toys from the Philippines, imagining what it would be like to visit those  faraway lands.

Some of my most treasured memories from childhood involve sitting in the living room or in the backyard listening to stories about  my father’s childhood or about his adventures in the navy. Like Aesop’s fables, these stories almost always came with some moral that we were supposed to  take from them. My son Drew and I were recently in Wisconsin for a family reunion, and we again heard stories about the importance of hard work, competence,  and integrity.

My father also taught me—more through his reaction to war than through his words—to despise war. Although he could never speak of  combat—and he still can’t to this day—one navy story inevitably connected to another, and he often found himself led to memories that he would rather  suppress. We could discern when he had reached this point because he swallowed hard, his eyes welled with tears, and he looked off into the distance. My  mother recently observed, “They don’t give Purple Hearts for those wounds.”

Another significant lesson—never stated explicitly but reinforced  repeatedly in his stories—was that one person could change the world. As far as I know, my dad never changed the course of the war through his naval  service, but his stories showed me why the navy always valued one more good man. During the war he was only an enlisted radioman, but I was convinced as a  young boy that, aside from Admiral Nimitz, my father was the most important person in the Pacific Fleet. To me he was—and he remains—a great  man.

As President Joseph F. Smith wrote over 100 years ago:

&lt;i&gt;Those things which we call extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may  make history, but they do not make real life.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind,  is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman.&lt;/i&gt;  [“Common-Place Things,” &lt;i&gt;Juvenile Instructor, &lt;/i&gt;15 December 1905, 752]

From my own experience I knew that my dad could fix anything.  Whether the problem was mechanical, electrical, or personal, he seemed to always have an answer. Like many young boys I looked up to my dad. He was one of  my heroes.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing My Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
During those growing-up years in Osseo, Wisconsin, everyone called me by my first name, Doug. Strangely, my  group of friends went through a phase in which we decided to call each other by our fathers’ names. Some of those names stuck, but “Gordon Smith” did not  seem like a good fit for me at that time. And I was largely content with my name, except when my high school English teacher decided to call me “Dougie.” No  one in that day was asking me to teach them “how to Dougie.”

I was still Doug Smith when I arrived at BYU in August 1980. I was not a member of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but my first class in college was Religion 121: The Book of Mormon. My best friend in high school, who had  convinced me to attend BYU with him, told me I shouldn’t worry about this class. He said the Book of Mormon was just a history of South America, and that  was all I knew about the course.

So I showed up on the first day, and the professor introduced the course by saying we would be covering the first  half of the Book of Mormon. He started to talk about the events that we would encounter. I wasn’t worried until the guy next to me raised his hand and said,  “Will we be discussing the sons of Mosiah in this course?”

I did a double take. I thought, “How does he know anything about what’s in this book?”  And I thought, “Well, the professor will provide us some context for the people who didn’t read ahead.” But he just answered the student as if it was a  completely natural question.

And then another student raised his hand and said, “How about Samuel the Lamanite? That guy is cool!” Everybody  laughed, and I completely missed the joke. Then another person said something, and by this point in the class I was starting to panic.

I wasn’t in  the habit of praying at the time—I didn’t really pray much at all—but I just decided that since I was at BYU, I would bow my head and say a little prayer:  “Please, God, make them stop.”

Well, it did eventually stop, and at the end of class I approached the teacher and asked, “Did you post an  assignment for the first class?”

“No, why do you ask?”

“Well, it just seems like everybody’s read ahead.”

He looked me up and  down and said, “You aren’t a member, are you?”

I thought about that for a second, and I responded, “A member of what?”

So we had a nice  long talk about the class, and I read the Book of Mormon in my first year at BYU.

The transition from that first day of college to my baptism in  the fall semester of my sophomore year did not require a dramatic change in my lifestyle, but my worldview was completely upended. Embracing the gospel  impelled me to look outward in a way that I never had before, to place others before myself: “Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will  lose his life for my sake shall find it” (Matthew 16:25).

I decided to serve a mission, and one year after my baptism I was called to serve in  Vienna, Austria. I became Elder Smith. Over the past few weeks I have read my missionary journals. I don’t know if any of you have done that, but it is a  horrifying experience. I’m not a great journal writer, but I was impressed by the effort I expended in trying to create a new identity for myself as Elder  Smith. I wanted to become a powerful missionary. I knew that Austria was not a high-baptizing mission, but, I thought, England wasn’t a high-baptizing  mission before Wilford Woodruff got there either. Unfortunately my motives were entirely self-interested: I felt like I had a debt to pay, and I wanted to  pay it. I hadn’t internalized the lesson taught by King Benjamin that even if we serve God with our “whole souls,” we remain “unprofitable servants” (Mosiah  2:21).

I worked hard in Austria, and I was frustrated at my inability to reduce my debt. Every sacrifice that I made, every extra effort that I  made, was repaid many times over, and early in my mission I wrote about my frustration in my journal:

&lt;i&gt;I have been so blessed by the Lord  . . . , and I wanted to go on a mission, in part, to show the Lord how much I love Him. To think of my mission as just something else by which I can make  myself better is offensive to me. That implies that the biggest attempt I’ve made in my life to be selfless has turned into the most selfish endeavor that I  have ever undertaken.&lt;/i&gt;

By the end of my mission I had come to terms with God over my indebtedness, and I had learned that the  most valuable lesson of my mission was to love the people. As King Benjamin said, “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the  service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). During my last week in Austria I wrote the following entry in my journal while riding on a train from Vienna  to Linz:

&lt;i&gt;Austria is a beautiful land, dotted with small villages. One of the most common sights from the train is the steeple of a  Catholic church against the background of rolling green hills. We are sitting with a lady from Vienna who is dressed in a traditional Austrian hat, blouse,  and skirt. Tradition prevents most Austrians from hearing our message. And, yet, after being rejected by thousands of people, I have learned to love these  people with a love that I have felt for no others. Somehow, I pray for them, cry for them, and hope for them as I do my own  family.&lt;/i&gt;

You can perceive in these entries a journey taken by many young people—a transition from inward-looking, self-centered  teenagers to outward-looking, empathetic adults.

When I returned to Osseo after my mission, I shed the title of Elder Smith, and, like many  returned missionaries, including my son Drew, who just came home from Ukraine, I went through that awkward phase of adjusting to being called by my first  name. In my case, however, my pre-mission name evoked thoughts about a confused young boy who had arrived at BYU three years before. “Doug” just didn’t seem  to fit anymore, but I didn’t do anything about it until I met a young woman at BYU the following year who was changing her name. She just decided one day to  ask people to call her by her middle name. And they did!

I thought, “Is that really all there is to it? Just tell people, ‘Call me [Whatever],’  and they do it?” This was a revelation to me. I didn’t have to be Doug Smith anymore. I could be anything I wanted! After much contemplation I decided that  using my middle name would not only be the simplest change—after all, I wouldn’t have to make a legal change to my name—but it would also honor my father.  What I did not fully comprehend was how that change would affect me.

Changing my name was a tremendous hassle. My wife, Sue, was supportive, and I  didn’t ask our families to call me Gordon, so when we visit relatives I’m still Doug. But the real challenge was among my friends. In my first accounting  class of the fall semester, legendary accounting professor Jay Smith called on me by my first name, and I asked, “Would you mind calling me  Gordon?”

By that time I was well into my major, and both he and my classmates looked at me quizzically, wondering, “What’s the punch  line?”

But I didn’t have a punch line. “Um . . . I changed my name to Gordon.”

In another class so many people knew me by the name Doug  that they simply wouldn’t allow me to change my name to Gordon. They insisted, over my protests, that I was joking. My coworkers and supervisors in the  Reading and Writing Center split about evenly between those who made the adjustment and those who couldn’t, and that just caused confusion. It was hard on  people.

Several times during the first few months I considered abandoning my project. In conversation I stumbled over my new name. More than once  I failed to acknowledge people who called me Gordon. I experimented with new signatures. I changed my driver’s license. I learned to fill out forms that had  blanks for “First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name.”

At the same time I was surprised to discover that when people called me Gordon, it felt  different than being called Doug. In the beginning, each reference to Gordon caused me to think about my father. I was clothing myself in his name, and I  felt obliged to wear it honorably. I didn’t want to become my father, but I wanted to become a person who would make him proud. Over time I came to  associate the name Gordon with my Mormon identity and the name Doug with my pre-Mormon life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking Christ’s Name Upon Us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I have sometimes  thought of the experience of changing my name in relation to my baptism—an ordinance in which I took upon myself the name of Jesus Christ. In both instances  the name was given to me by another, but I was asked to embrace the name as my own. Now each week in taking the sacrament I reaffirm my willingness to take  upon myself the name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77). What is the significance of this representation?

When I took upon myself the name of my  father, I was not using his name as a description of my character. I was not saying, “I am my father.” Rather, I was using the name to honor him and to  inspire myself to develop attributes like him. Similarly, taking upon ourselves the name of Christ is not a recognition of an achievement but rather a nudge  toward improved behavior.

King Benjamin gave his people the name of Christ only after the Spirit had changed their hearts, but he gave them the  name not because they had reached some threshold and not because they had “no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (Mosiah 5:2). Rather,  he gave them the name so that they could remember that moment and remain “steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works” (Mosiah  5:15).

When faithful people take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ, they assume a name that is imbued with meaning. President Spencer W.  Kimball once said, “The name Jesus Christ and what it represents has been plowed deep into the history of the world, never to be uprooted” (“Why Call Me  Lord, Lord, and Do Not the Things Which I Say?” &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;May 1975, 4). This feature of the name is useful in transmitting large quantities of  information. Rather than saying that we should have “faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility,  diligence” (D&amp;amp;C 4:6)—or any of the other myriad of attributes that we associate with Jesus Christ—we can say more simply that we take upon ourselves the  name of Christ. Moreover, because we have stories of His life, Christ’s name has a richness and texture that is impossible to convey merely by listing the  attributes of His character.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name-Calling and Judging&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I have spoken about the positive power of naming, but naming also has a dark side.  Just as naming can inspire and direct, it can also discourage or obstruct. This is a phenomenon that we all recognize as name-calling or labeling. The line  between labeling for the purpose of providing information and labeling for the purpose of marginalizing others can be subtle, but I will strive to  illustrate a few guiding principles from my experiences as a law professor.

Each year BYU Law School attracts some of the brightest law students  in the country. I have taught at six law schools in the United States and in several programs abroad, and I know from law students. When I came to BYU five  years ago, some of my colleagues at other law schools wondered aloud whether law could be taught effectively at a school whose students who share so many  religious values.

While an outsider might imagine legal education at BYU Law School as a form of indoctrination, my experience has been quite the  contrary. The fairly high degree of religious homogeneity we experience here has actually enabled or encouraged discussions in class that are more vigorous  than those discussions that typically occur at other law schools. While students at other law schools often pass off their disagreements on the simplistic  grounds that they belong to different value groups, students at BYU’s law school often feel compelled to examine the implications of their assumed shared  beliefs. This is real learning, not indoctrination.

For example, in my Contracts class, students express a range of views about the social  implications of contracting. (The following discussion draws in part on Stewart Macaulay, Jean Braucher, John Kidwell, and William Whitford, &lt;i&gt;Contracts:  Law in Action,&lt;/i&gt; 3rd ed. [New Providence, New Jersey: LexisNexis Matthew Bender, 2010], 491–93.) Some students enter the class with a bias in favor of  market transactions, believing that economic efficiency and respect for the liberty of individuals should compel courts to enforce almost all contracts,  regardless of the consequences. The students who hold this view sometimes invoke the gospel principle of agency, arguing that we all benefit if people are  encouraged to take responsibility for their own risk.

Other students enter the course with a bias in favor of social control, believing that  respect for the dignity of individuals should compel courts to protect the weakest members of our society. The students who hold this view sometimes appeal  to the gospel principle of charity, arguing that legal rules should ensure that contracts are fair and that people with more wealth, talent, or bargaining  skill should not be allowed to use those advantages to prey upon the weak.

Former Yale law professor Arthur Allen Leff recognized both of these  impulses and described in poetic prose why we cannot have our cake and eat it too:

&lt;i&gt;In effect, we want to have the world so arranged that  everyone will be motivated to get as good a deal for himself as possible by being as informed and efficient as he can be, but that no one will have to get a  bad deal in the process. But the payoff for the former necessitates, indeed entails, the latter. Hence doing both is not a technical problem . . . but a  cultural one: we cannot have perfect freedom and perfect fairness at once. What we have, instead,&lt;/i&gt;[are] . . . &lt;i&gt;legal device&lt;/i&gt;[s] &lt;i&gt;that  &lt;/i&gt;[allow]&lt;i&gt; us, inconsistently and with only symbolic impact, an occasional evasive bow in the direction of our incoherent hearts’ desires.&lt;/i&gt; [“Thomist  Unconscionability,”&lt;i&gt;Canadian Business Law Journal&lt;/i&gt; 4 (1979–1980): 428]

Sometimes in the course of our class discussions the students  will square off in these two camps—even identifying members of the rival camp with a derogatory name—but I strive to be sensitive about the formation of  viewpoint cliques in the classroom. If students caricature their classmates—if they attempt to marginalize someone in the class as an “other”—then learning  suffers and we have to talk about the importance of empathy in learning law. We truly understand our own views only when we understand the views of those  who disagree with us. In seeking to understand those who disagree with us, my own experience has been that views evolve. This is not only acceptable but  praiseworthy.

In the April 2012 general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf reminded us to “stop judging others and replace judgmental  thoughts and feelings with a heart full of love for God and His children” (“The Merciful Obtain Mercy,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;May 2012, 75). Name-calling and  labeling are forms of judgment, and the problem with judgment is its finality. As disciples of Jesus Christ we should encourage people to change and  improve. If we believe that others have taken a wrong turn, one of the greatest acts of charity that we can perform is to give them room to  repent.

As observed by President Uchtdorf:

&lt;i&gt;We must recognize that we are all imperfect—that we are beggars before God. Haven’t  we all, at one time or another, meekly approached the mercy seat and pleaded for grace? Haven’t we wished with all the energy of our souls for mercy—to be  forgiven for the mistakes we have made and the sins we have committed?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Because we all depend on the mercy of God, how can we deny to others  any measure of the grace we so desperately desire for ourselves? My beloved brothers and sisters, should we not forgive as we wish to be forgiven? &lt;/i&gt;[“The  Merciful Obtain Mercy,” 75]

Thus, if we are to be like Jesus Christ—if we have truly taken upon ourselves His name—we should avoid  name-calling and labeling and stand ever ready to receive those who have strayed. My own experience has been that when we exercise influence “by persuasion,  by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (D&amp;amp;C 121:41), we not only bless the lives of others but we also elevate  ourselves.

I pray that we may all come closer to that ideal, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I am  grateful for the opportunity to speak today. The weekly devotionals and forums have been a big part of my BYU experience. I attended them when I was a  student, and my wife and I still attend them with our children who are students here. I am also grateful to my family, friends, and colleagues who have  taken the time to be with us today.</p>
<p>Today is my father’s birthday. He is eighty-seven years old. He and my mother are in Wisconsin watching this  devotional, and if the volume on the television is turned all the way up, they are listening to it too.</p>
<p>My father’s name is Gordon Smith. My  mother told me recently—and she reminds me often—that my father never wanted a son named Gordon, but he agreed to give me his first name as my middle name.  This is the story about why I took that name upon myself and why I have come to believe that the names we call each other are important.</p>
<h2><b>Why I Took My  Father’s Name</b></h2>
<p>To understand why I took my father’s name as my own, you need to know a bit about my relationship with my father. My father and  several generations before him had been dairy farmers in Wisconsin, but in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, my father, only seventeen years  old at the time, joined the navy and was assigned to serve in the South Pacific. He eventually made a career of the military, and I was born in a naval  hospital in Bremerton, Washington. Shortly after my birth he was transferred to San Diego, California, where he taught Teletype repair for five years.  Following his retirement our family returned to his childhood home of Wisconsin, and that’s where I grew up. Many of my earliest memories involve feeding  and caring for cows, pigs, and chickens on our small farm, though I was temperamentally not well suited to farming.</p>
<p>My uneasy relationship with  farming became apparent to our whole family when our pigs disappeared. Our pigs were named Slurp and Burp. One day they were just gone, and I asked around,  “Where did Slurp and Burp go?” Nobody else seemed troubled by their disappearance. They just said that somebody had come and taken them away.</p>
<p>A  few weeks later, over a dinner featuring pork chops, my older sister—who introduced so much of life to me—said, pointing at my plate, “Remember Slurp and  Burp?”</p>
<p>Lessons about the circle of life were plentiful on that small farm. I saw my father assist in the birthing of a calf, and we drank milk  from the calf’s mother. I was playing basketball in the yard one day when a rabid raccoon came toward me, and my dad shot the raccoon. (At first I was  worried I had been in trouble, and I thought he had just missed.) We learned by observation that chickens do indeed come from eggs, and we also learned by  observation what it means to “run around like a chicken with its head cut off.”</p>
<p>Despite our humble and remote circumstances, I managed to  cultivate big dreams on that farm, in no small part because of my dad. During his last year of service in the navy he traveled the world and sent us  souvenirs from Europe, Asia, and Africa. He was gone for a year, and I remember that when he returned, I didn’t know what he looked like because I was only  four years old when he left and five when he returned. But I treasured those souvenirs that he sent me, and I spent many hours in my room in Wisconsin  looking at photos of Rome or pounding on a drum from Africa or playing with toys from the Philippines, imagining what it would be like to visit those  faraway lands.</p>
<p>Some of my most treasured memories from childhood involve sitting in the living room or in the backyard listening to stories about  my father’s childhood or about his adventures in the navy. Like Aesop’s fables, these stories almost always came with some moral that we were supposed to  take from them. My son Drew and I were recently in Wisconsin for a family reunion, and we again heard stories about the importance of hard work, competence,  and integrity.</p>
<p>My father also taught me—more through his reaction to war than through his words—to despise war. Although he could never speak of  combat—and he still can’t to this day—one navy story inevitably connected to another, and he often found himself led to memories that he would rather  suppress. We could discern when he had reached this point because he swallowed hard, his eyes welled with tears, and he looked off into the distance. My  mother recently observed, “They don’t give Purple Hearts for those wounds.”</p>
<p>Another significant lesson—never stated explicitly but reinforced  repeatedly in his stories—was that one person could change the world. As far as I know, my dad never changed the course of the war through his naval  service, but his stories showed me why the navy always valued one more good man. During the war he was only an enlisted radioman, but I was convinced as a  young boy that, aside from Admiral Nimitz, my father was the most important person in the Pacific Fleet. To me he was—and he remains—a great  man.</p>
<p>As President Joseph F. Smith wrote over 100 years ago:</p>
<p><i>Those things which we call extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may  make history, but they do not make real life.</i></p>
<p><i>After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind,  is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman.</i>  [“Common-Place Things,” <i>Juvenile Instructor, </i>15 December 1905, 752]</p>
<p>From my own experience I knew that my dad could fix anything.  Whether the problem was mechanical, electrical, or personal, he seemed to always have an answer. Like many young boys I looked up to my dad. He was one of  my heroes.</p>
<h2><b>Changing My Name</b></h2>
<p>During those growing-up years in Osseo, Wisconsin, everyone called me by my first name, Doug. Strangely, my  group of friends went through a phase in which we decided to call each other by our fathers’ names. Some of those names stuck, but “Gordon Smith” did not  seem like a good fit for me at that time. And I was largely content with my name, except when my high school English teacher decided to call me “Dougie.” No  one in that day was asking me to teach them “how to Dougie.”</p>
<p>I was still Doug Smith when I arrived at BYU in August 1980. I was not a member of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but my first class in college was Religion 121: The Book of Mormon. My best friend in high school, who had  convinced me to attend BYU with him, told me I shouldn’t worry about this class. He said the Book of Mormon was just a history of South America, and that  was all I knew about the course.</p>
<p>So I showed up on the first day, and the professor introduced the course by saying we would be covering the first  half of the Book of Mormon. He started to talk about the events that we would encounter. I wasn’t worried until the guy next to me raised his hand and said,  “Will we be discussing the sons of Mosiah in this course?”</p>
<p>I did a double take. I thought, “How does he know anything about what’s in this book?”  And I thought, “Well, the professor will provide us some context for the people who didn’t read ahead.” But he just answered the student as if it was a  completely natural question.</p>
<p>And then another student raised his hand and said, “How about Samuel the Lamanite? That guy is cool!” Everybody  laughed, and I completely missed the joke. Then another person said something, and by this point in the class I was starting to panic.</p>
<p>I wasn’t in  the habit of praying at the time—I didn’t really pray much at all—but I just decided that since I was at BYU, I would bow my head and say a little prayer:  “Please, God, make them stop.”</p>
<p>Well, it did eventually stop, and at the end of class I approached the teacher and asked, “Did you post an  assignment for the first class?”</p>
<p>“No, why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Well, it just seems like everybody’s read ahead.”</p>
<p>He looked me up and  down and said, “You aren’t a member, are you?”</p>
<p>I thought about that for a second, and I responded, “A member of what?”</p>
<p>So we had a nice  long talk about the class, and I read the Book of Mormon in my first year at BYU.</p>
<p>The transition from that first day of college to my baptism in  the fall semester of my sophomore year did not require a dramatic change in my lifestyle, but my worldview was completely upended. Embracing the gospel  impelled me to look outward in a way that I never had before, to place others before myself: “Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will  lose his life for my sake shall find it” (Matthew 16:25).</p>
<p>I decided to serve a mission, and one year after my baptism I was called to serve in  Vienna, Austria. I became Elder Smith. Over the past few weeks I have read my missionary journals. I don’t know if any of you have done that, but it is a  horrifying experience. I’m not a great journal writer, but I was impressed by the effort I expended in trying to create a new identity for myself as Elder  Smith. I wanted to become a powerful missionary. I knew that Austria was not a high-baptizing mission, but, I thought, England wasn’t a high-baptizing  mission before Wilford Woodruff got there either. Unfortunately my motives were entirely self-interested: I felt like I had a debt to pay, and I wanted to  pay it. I hadn’t internalized the lesson taught by King Benjamin that even if we serve God with our “whole souls,” we remain “unprofitable servants” (Mosiah  2:21).</p>
<p>I worked hard in Austria, and I was frustrated at my inability to reduce my debt. Every sacrifice that I made, every extra effort that I  made, was repaid many times over, and early in my mission I wrote about my frustration in my journal:</p>
<p><i>I have been so blessed by the Lord  . . . , and I wanted to go on a mission, in part, to show the Lord how much I love Him. To think of my mission as just something else by which I can make  myself better is offensive to me. That implies that the biggest attempt I’ve made in my life to be selfless has turned into the most selfish endeavor that I  have ever undertaken.</i></p>
<p>By the end of my mission I had come to terms with God over my indebtedness, and I had learned that the  most valuable lesson of my mission was to love the people. As King Benjamin said, “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the  service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). During my last week in Austria I wrote the following entry in my journal while riding on a train from Vienna  to Linz:</p>
<p><i>Austria is a beautiful land, dotted with small villages. One of the most common sights from the train is the steeple of a  Catholic church against the background of rolling green hills. We are sitting with a lady from Vienna who is dressed in a traditional Austrian hat, blouse,  and skirt. Tradition prevents most Austrians from hearing our message. And, yet, after being rejected by thousands of people, I have learned to love these  people with a love that I have felt for no others. Somehow, I pray for them, cry for them, and hope for them as I do my own  family.</i></p>
<p>You can perceive in these entries a journey taken by many young people—a transition from inward-looking, self-centered  teenagers to outward-looking, empathetic adults.</p>
<p>When I returned to Osseo after my mission, I shed the title of Elder Smith, and, like many  returned missionaries, including my son Drew, who just came home from Ukraine, I went through that awkward phase of adjusting to being called by my first  name. In my case, however, my pre-mission name evoked thoughts about a confused young boy who had arrived at BYU three years before. “Doug” just didn’t seem  to fit anymore, but I didn’t do anything about it until I met a young woman at BYU the following year who was changing her name. She just decided one day to  ask people to call her by her middle name. And they did!</p>
<p>I thought, “Is that really all there is to it? Just tell people, ‘Call me [Whatever],’  and they do it?” This was a revelation to me. I didn’t have to be Doug Smith anymore. I could be anything I wanted! After much contemplation I decided that  using my middle name would not only be the simplest change—after all, I wouldn’t have to make a legal change to my name—but it would also honor my father.  What I did not fully comprehend was how that change would affect me.</p>
<p>Changing my name was a tremendous hassle. My wife, Sue, was supportive, and I  didn’t ask our families to call me Gordon, so when we visit relatives I’m still Doug. But the real challenge was among my friends. In my first accounting  class of the fall semester, legendary accounting professor Jay Smith called on me by my first name, and I asked, “Would you mind calling me  Gordon?”</p>
<p>By that time I was well into my major, and both he and my classmates looked at me quizzically, wondering, “What’s the punch  line?”</p>
<p>But I didn’t have a punch line. “Um . . . I changed my name to Gordon.”</p>
<p>In another class so many people knew me by the name Doug  that they simply wouldn’t allow me to change my name to Gordon. They insisted, over my protests, that I was joking. My coworkers and supervisors in the  Reading and Writing Center split about evenly between those who made the adjustment and those who couldn’t, and that just caused confusion. It was hard on  people.</p>
<p>Several times during the first few months I considered abandoning my project. In conversation I stumbled over my new name. More than once  I failed to acknowledge people who called me Gordon. I experimented with new signatures. I changed my driver’s license. I learned to fill out forms that had  blanks for “First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name.”</p>
<p>At the same time I was surprised to discover that when people called me Gordon, it felt  different than being called Doug. In the beginning, each reference to Gordon caused me to think about my father. I was clothing myself in his name, and I  felt obliged to wear it honorably. I didn’t want to become my father, but I wanted to become a person who would make him proud. Over time I came to  associate the name Gordon with my Mormon identity and the name Doug with my pre-Mormon life.</p>
<h2><b>Taking Christ’s Name Upon Us</b></h2>
<p>I have sometimes  thought of the experience of changing my name in relation to my baptism—an ordinance in which I took upon myself the name of Jesus Christ. In both instances  the name was given to me by another, but I was asked to embrace the name as my own. Now each week in taking the sacrament I reaffirm my willingness to take  upon myself the name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;C 20:77). What is the significance of this representation?</p>
<p>When I took upon myself the name of my  father, I was not using his name as a description of my character. I was not saying, “I am my father.” Rather, I was using the name to honor him and to  inspire myself to develop attributes like him. Similarly, taking upon ourselves the name of Christ is not a recognition of an achievement but rather a nudge  toward improved behavior.</p>
<p>King Benjamin gave his people the name of Christ only after the Spirit had changed their hearts, but he gave them the  name not because they had reached some threshold and not because they had “no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (Mosiah 5:2). Rather,  he gave them the name so that they could remember that moment and remain “steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works” (Mosiah  5:15).</p>
<p>When faithful people take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ, they assume a name that is imbued with meaning. President Spencer W.  Kimball once said, “The name Jesus Christ and what it represents has been plowed deep into the history of the world, never to be uprooted” (“Why Call Me  Lord, Lord, and Do Not the Things Which I Say?” <i>Ensign, </i>May 1975, 4). This feature of the name is useful in transmitting large quantities of  information. Rather than saying that we should have “faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility,  diligence” (D&amp;C 4:6)—or any of the other myriad of attributes that we associate with Jesus Christ—we can say more simply that we take upon ourselves the  name of Christ. Moreover, because we have stories of His life, Christ’s name has a richness and texture that is impossible to convey merely by listing the  attributes of His character.</p>
<h2><b>Name-Calling and Judging</b></h2>
<p>I have spoken about the positive power of naming, but naming also has a dark side.  Just as naming can inspire and direct, it can also discourage or obstruct. This is a phenomenon that we all recognize as name-calling or labeling. The line  between labeling for the purpose of providing information and labeling for the purpose of marginalizing others can be subtle, but I will strive to  illustrate a few guiding principles from my experiences as a law professor.</p>
<p>Each year BYU Law School attracts some of the brightest law students  in the country. I have taught at six law schools in the United States and in several programs abroad, and I know from law students. When I came to BYU five  years ago, some of my colleagues at other law schools wondered aloud whether law could be taught effectively at a school whose students who share so many  religious values.</p>
<p>While an outsider might imagine legal education at BYU Law School as a form of indoctrination, my experience has been quite the  contrary. The fairly high degree of religious homogeneity we experience here has actually enabled or encouraged discussions in class that are more vigorous  than those discussions that typically occur at other law schools. While students at other law schools often pass off their disagreements on the simplistic  grounds that they belong to different value groups, students at BYU’s law school often feel compelled to examine the implications of their assumed shared  beliefs. This is real learning, not indoctrination.</p>
<p>For example, in my Contracts class, students express a range of views about the social  implications of contracting. (The following discussion draws in part on Stewart Macaulay, Jean Braucher, John Kidwell, and William Whitford, <i>Contracts:  Law in Action,</i> 3rd ed. [New Providence, New Jersey: LexisNexis Matthew Bender, 2010], 491–93.) Some students enter the class with a bias in favor of  market transactions, believing that economic efficiency and respect for the liberty of individuals should compel courts to enforce almost all contracts,  regardless of the consequences. The students who hold this view sometimes invoke the gospel principle of agency, arguing that we all benefit if people are  encouraged to take responsibility for their own risk.</p>
<p>Other students enter the course with a bias in favor of social control, believing that  respect for the dignity of individuals should compel courts to protect the weakest members of our society. The students who hold this view sometimes appeal  to the gospel principle of charity, arguing that legal rules should ensure that contracts are fair and that people with more wealth, talent, or bargaining  skill should not be allowed to use those advantages to prey upon the weak.</p>
<p>Former Yale law professor Arthur Allen Leff recognized both of these  impulses and described in poetic prose why we cannot have our cake and eat it too:</p>
<p><i>In effect, we want to have the world so arranged that  everyone will be motivated to get as good a deal for himself as possible by being as informed and efficient as he can be, but that no one will have to get a  bad deal in the process. But the payoff for the former necessitates, indeed entails, the latter. Hence doing both is not a technical problem . . . but a  cultural one: we cannot have perfect freedom and perfect fairness at once. What we have, instead,</i>[are] . . . <i>legal device</i>[s] <i>that  </i>[allow]<i> us, inconsistently and with only symbolic impact, an occasional evasive bow in the direction of our incoherent hearts’ desires.</i> [“Thomist  Unconscionability,”<i>Canadian Business Law Journal</i> 4 (1979–1980): 428]</p>
<p>Sometimes in the course of our class discussions the students  will square off in these two camps—even identifying members of the rival camp with a derogatory name—but I strive to be sensitive about the formation of  viewpoint cliques in the classroom. If students caricature their classmates—if they attempt to marginalize someone in the class as an “other”—then learning  suffers and we have to talk about the importance of empathy in learning law. We truly understand our own views only when we understand the views of those  who disagree with us. In seeking to understand those who disagree with us, my own experience has been that views evolve. This is not only acceptable but  praiseworthy.</p>
<p>In the April 2012 general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf reminded us to “stop judging others and replace judgmental  thoughts and feelings with a heart full of love for God and His children” (“The Merciful Obtain Mercy,” <i>Ensign, </i>May 2012, 75). Name-calling and  labeling are forms of judgment, and the problem with judgment is its finality. As disciples of Jesus Christ we should encourage people to change and  improve. If we believe that others have taken a wrong turn, one of the greatest acts of charity that we can perform is to give them room to  repent.</p>
<p>As observed by President Uchtdorf:</p>
<p><i>We must recognize that we are all imperfect—that we are beggars before God. Haven’t  we all, at one time or another, meekly approached the mercy seat and pleaded for grace? Haven’t we wished with all the energy of our souls for mercy—to be  forgiven for the mistakes we have made and the sins we have committed?</i></p>
<p><i>Because we all depend on the mercy of God, how can we deny to others  any measure of the grace we so desperately desire for ourselves? My beloved brothers and sisters, should we not forgive as we wish to be forgiven? </i>[“The  Merciful Obtain Mercy,” 75]</p>
<p>Thus, if we are to be like Jesus Christ—if we have truly taken upon ourselves His name—we should avoid  name-calling and labeling and stand ever ready to receive those who have strayed. My own experience has been that when we exercise influence “by persuasion,  by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (D&amp;C 121:41), we not only bless the lives of others but we also elevate  ourselves.</p>
<p>I pray that we may all come closer to that ideal, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During our mission in Canada, my wife and I gave a “last instruction” to departing missionaries the day before they went home. Each of these young elders and sisters were heroes to us, and we wanted their transition home to be very, very successful. Our instruction was given with love and good fun. I particularly enjoyed instructing on dating and marriage.
One afternoon as I stood at the blackboard during a last instruction, the Spirit pressed Helaman 5:12 deeply into my mind. This scripture came from what could have been the Book of Mormon prophet Helaman’s “last instruction” to his sons prior to their departure for their magnificent mission to the Nephites and the Lamanites.
We all quoted the scripture together:
And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
What a magnificent verse of scripture. Think of it: Helaman promised us that if we build our foundation upon our Savior, we cannot fall, regardless of what Satan throws at us. What a powerful promise!
Our Savior gave the same promise in the Sermon on the Mount:
Whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken . . . unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock—
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.1
I bet a lot of you Primary graduates are thinking of a song. Would you sing it with me—just the first two verses, with hand motions?
The wise man built his house upon the rock,
The wise man built his house upon the rock,
The wise man built his house upon the rock,
And the rains came tumbling down.
The rains came down, and the floods came up,
The rains came down, and the floods came up,
The rains came down, and the floods came up,
And the house on the rock stood still.2
Thank you! Doesn’t this simple song teach a powerful lesson?
Luke put it slightly differently:
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them . . .
. . . is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.3
When a person comes to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and he</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Today I would like to talk about some of the big issues of our time through the lens of history and literature as well as the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We live in a day of technological and scientific marvels. It is also a time of uncertainty—one in which many ­question whether or not faith and religion have a place in their lives or in the public square. You too will have to decide whether faith has an enduring place in your own life.
In fact, there are dramatic changes occurring within this country as it relates to faith and religion. A recent Pew Research Center study reported a dramatic decline in the share of the U.S. population that identifies as Christian. From 2007 to 2014—in just seven years—it fell by an extraordinary 8 percent.1 While the drop is occurring across the board, it is especially pronounced among young adults. The world today poses many threats to faith in God, and the unfortunate fact is that faith in God is waning.
This is not the first time in history that such a crisis of faith has loomed. There was a similar period around 100 years ago. As the twentieth century opened, the world held great hope and enthusiasm for the future. Science was supplying astounding breakthroughs at every turn and the world seemed to be rushing toward a modern period when mankind, through its own self-generated progress and technology, might finally be able to solve the ancient problems of our world.
Consider some of the varied discoveries and inventions in just the first decade of the twentieth century. The modern escalator was invented—perhaps a kind of metaphor of man’s supposedly inevitable rise. Marconi sent the first transatlantic radio signal. The vacuum cleaner and the tractor were developed—­harbingers of liberation from more arduous forms of labor. The Wright brothers flew the first manned flight. Albert Einstein stunned the world with his theory of relativity. Henry Ford produced more than 10,000 cars on the first assembly line of its kind. The world saw its first talking motion picture and Marie Curie discovered radium.2
Cultural historian Richard Tarnas characterized the period this way:
Using his own natural intelligence, and without the aid of Holy Scripture’s divine revelation, man had penetrated nature’s mysteries, transformed his universe, and immeasurably enhanced his existence. . . . His own wits and will could change his world. Science gave man a new faith—not only in scientific knowledge, but in himself.3
This period of time gave rise to what is known as “the myth of progress”—that is, the idea that mankind was somehow destined to rise inexorably on this wave of scientific progress to a new Eden. So it was that on the eve of the First World War, as the quest for power and political dominance reared its ugly head yet again in Europe, the response was a sadly naïve one.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I feel honored and humbled to have received the assignment from the First Presidency to speak to you precious young people today. I hope that you have an appreciation of how much the prophet and the First Presidency care about you and love you. You are among “the noble and great.”1
[A man arrived] home from work to find a very small girl sitting on the curb in front of his house, crying. He asked if he could help. Through her sobs she explained that she was lost. He told her that this was his house and his wife was inside. He told her he knew she shouldn’t go with strangers, but if she felt comfortable going inside, he and his wife would try to find her home. They went into his house, and his wife, Linda, began to console the little girl. “I’m sure you must be very frightened,” she said.
“I was frightened,” the girl responded, “until I saw the picture of Jesus hanging on your wall. Then I knew I would be safe.”2
It is the same for us all. The answer always is Jesus Christ. At times you may feel that you are sitting on the curb lost and afraid, but if you will look to the Savior, He will guide you safely home. He is the one infallible source of help for each of us, my dear young adult friends.
One of the most profound and sublime of gospel understandings is the doctrine of law. It is stated so simply in the Doctrine and Covenants: “That which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.”3 By law, the Father governs us within His great plan of happiness. He sent His Son to show us the way. We learn of Him. We follow Him. We have faith in Him. We pray in His name. Because of His enabling Atonement we can grow, repent, and do what is necessary to invite the fulness of Heavenly Father’s blessings. And we do all of this by law. Within the law, each of us is fully responsible. To have the law work in our lives, we must act; we must stand up from the curb and follow Him.
In my sweet interactions with young people in both single and married stakes and as a mission president, I have seen how each young person must discover and then choose to walk his or her own personal path. Sometimes we are tempted to measure our progress by looking at what others are doing or have achieved. Your path is unique to you. Only you can receive heavenly guidance to pursue your path. If you choose to take detours, then you and only you can find your way back. President Henry B. Eyring taught:
Heavenly Father has perfect foresight, knows each of us, and knows our future. He knows what difficulties we will pass through. He sent His Son to suffer so that He would know how to succor us in all our trials.4
Christ understands and is aware of your personal young adult decisions; your questions, hopes, dreams, and needs; and the intents of your heart5—and even y</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I came to BYU after a career in advertising, and now I’m enjoying my thirteenth year in a “career crescendo.” I don’t know what that means to those in music, but I’ve enjoyed every minute of those thirteen years so far.
The field of sports is a wonderful place to find metaphors and analogies for life, and I would like to begin with one this morning: the phrase “leaving it all on the field,” which is to say that one gives everything out there on the playing field, the court, or the stage, holding nothing back. There are times in our lives when this analogy makes particular sense. For example, when serving a mission you would want to make sure that you came home with no regrets, that you “left it all” in your field of labor. There is something awfully satisfying about giving 100 percent, whatever the assignment.
But what if your pre-earth assignment was to come to the playing field of mortality, where there would be forces of opposition trying to keep you from leaving it all on the field? Such is certainly the case with earth life. But how do we then give our all? What can we do to ensure that we leave this life with the fewest possible regrets? For the next few minutes I will discuss one sure way, and that is to come under the influence of the Master—the one perfect example of someone who indeed left it all on this very playing field.
And so I have titled my remarks this morning “The Approachable Master: Life’s Critical Relationship.” Let me begin by putting a series of related questions to all of us:
Why is it that we do not befriend with greater intensity our Savior, “The Master of ocean and earth and skies,”1 at a level that truly affects—perhaps even drives—our own personal behavior?
Said another way, why do we not capitalize on the Spirit of Christ within all of us to more completely comprehend the Master’s purpose and the will of the only name under heaven by which we may gain life eternal?2
Lastly, why do we not accept more openly the Savior’s simple invitation to “come unto me?”
In much the same way President Ezra Taft Benson approached our tendency as a people to undervalue the positive effects of studying the Book of Mormon,3 may I be bold enough this morning to suggest that the same condition may well apply for us as we come to know the Savior. There is so much more to gain by developing a truly interactive relationship with the Master. To use His own parable, could it be that we are the travelers on the highway and that the master has bid us to his wedding feast? Why would we not come?4
We can learn of the Master, even love Him for all He has accomplished on our behalf, and yet still position ourselves beyond our own ability to receive many additional and ennobling blessings. It would be like joining a sports team but not going to practice, not benefiting from the coach’s experience, and n</span>
