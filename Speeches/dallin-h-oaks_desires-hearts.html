  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Each of us desires the ultimate blessing of exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Even when we fall short, we desire what is right. That is my subject - "The Desires of Our Hearts."

I am interested in this subject because it highlights a critical contrast between the laws of God, as revealed in the scriptures, and what I will call the laws of man, as set out in the national and state laws with which I was concerned in my thirty years in the legal profession.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laws - Mans and Gods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The laws of man are never concerned about a persons desires or thoughts in isolation. When the law inquires into a persons state of mind or intent, it only seeks to determine what consequence should be assigned to particular actions that person has taken.

In contrast, the laws of God are concerned with spiritual things. Spiritual consequences are affected by actions, but they are also affected by desires or thoughts, independent of actions. Gospel consequences flow from the desires of our hearts.

A simple example will illustrate that contrast. Suppose your neighbor has a beautiful sports car parked in his driveway. You take no action. You just look on that car longingly, and covet it. You have sinned. You have broken one of the Ten Commandments (see Exodus 20:17). Eternal consequences follow.

Up to this point you have not broken any of the laws of man. However, if you take a particular action, such as jumping the ignition wires and driving away in the car, you will have committed a wrong that could be punished or redressed under the laws of man.

To determine what consequence should be assigned to your action, the law would attempt to determine your intent in taking the car. If you simply intended to borrow the car in the mistaken belief that your neighbor would consent, you might not be guilty of a crime. However, you would surely be liable for damages for the wrongful use of the car. If you intended to use the car contrary to the wishes of the owner and yet return it in a short time, you would have committed a minor crime. If you intended to take the car permanently, you would have committed a major crime. To choose among these various alternatives, a judge or jury would attempt to determine your state of mind.

This simple example makes the point that the laws of man will sometimes inquire into a persons state of mind in order to determine the consequences of particular actions, but the law will never punish or give effect to intent or desires standing alone. It was so in Book of Mormon times. As we read in Alma, the people of Nephi could be punished for their criminal actions, but "there was no law against a mans belief" (Alma 30:11).

It is good that this is so. The law is an imperfect instrument. It has no reliable way to look into a persons heart.

In contrast, Gods law can assign consequences solely on the basis of our innermost thoughts and desires. There is no uncertainty in the administration of this law. As Ammon taught King Lamoni, God "looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning" (Alma 18:32).

Similarly, Paul warned the Hebrews that God "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart," and "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him" (Hebrews 4:1213).

In other words, God judges us not only for our acts, but also for the desires of our hearts. He has said so again and again. This is a challenging reality, but it is not surprising. Agency and accountability are eternal principles. We exercise our free agency not only by what we &lt;i&gt;do, &lt;/i&gt;but also by what we &lt;i&gt;decide, &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;will, &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;desire. &lt;/i&gt;Restrictions on freedom can deprive us of the power &lt;i&gt;to do, &lt;/i&gt;but no one can deprive us of the power to &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;desire. &lt;/i&gt;Accountability must therefore reach and attach consequences to the desires of our hearts.

This principle applies both in a negative way - making us guilty of sin for evil thoughts and desires - and in a positive way - promising us blessings for righteous desires.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sins of Desire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The best-known scriptural designation of sin on the basis of the desires of our hearts concerns sexual sin. The Savior declared:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart. &lt;/i&gt;[3 Nephi 12:2728; see also Matthew 5:2728]

The New Testament also condemns anger and unrighteous feelings - another example of sins committed solely on the basis of thoughts (see Matthew 5:22).

The Book of Mormon illustrates this same principle in its definition of priestcraft, the sin committed by those who preach the gospel to gain personal advantage rather than to further the work of the Lord:

&lt;i&gt;Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Nephi 26:29; see also Alma 1:16]

Priestcraft is not a sin that is committed solely on the basis of our desires because it involves acts. Those acts becomes sinful only when they are done with the wrong desire, to get gain or praise. The sin is in the desire, not in the act.

The same is true of those who draw near to the Lord with their lips but have removed their hearts far from him. (See Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:8; 2 Nephi 27:25; JS - H 1:19.) Likewise, the Psalmist condemned the people of ancient Israel because "their heart was not right with [God]" (Psalms 78:37).

When is our heart right with God? Our heart is right with God when we truly desire what is righteous - when we desire what God desires.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Educating Our Desires&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Our divinely granted willpower gives us control over our desires, but it may take many years for us to be sure that we have willed and educated them to the point that all are entirely righteous.

President Joseph F. Smith taught that the "education. . . of our desires is one of far-reaching importance to our happiness in life" (Joseph F. Smith, &lt;i&gt;Gospel Doctrine &lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 297).

How do we educate our desires? We begin, I suppose, with our feelings. The desires of our hearts are deep-seated and fundamental. But our feelings are closer to the surface and easier for us to identify and influence.

Have you ever found yourself doing something you thought was right, but doing it because you "had" to? Did you ever keep a commandment of God with an attitude of resentment or self-righteousness, or even because you expected some immediate personal benefit? I suppose most of us have had this experience. Do you remember your feelings on such occasions? Do you think such feelings will be ignored by a Father in Heaven who gave us the willpower we call agency? Dont such feelings tell us something about the desires of our hearts?

In order to have righteous desires, we have to control our thoughts and achieve appropriate feelings. My widowed mother understood that principle. "Pray about your feelings," she used to say. She taught her three children that we should pray to have the right kind of feelings about our experiences - positive or negative - and about the people we knew. If our feelings were right, we would be more likely to take right actions and to act for the right reasons.

Mormon teaches that if our heart is not right, even a good action is not counted for righteousness.

&lt;i&gt;For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, &lt;/i&gt;. . . &lt;i&gt;except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God. &lt;/i&gt;[Moroni 7:68]

In other words, we must not only act, we must act for the right reasons. There are no blessings for actions taken without real intent.

Mormon even applied this principle to our prayers.

&lt;i&gt;And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth nonesuch. &lt;/i&gt;[Moroni 7:9]

When Joseph Smith first went to Cumorah, the angel refused to give him the plates, saying it was not yet time. During the years he had to wait before receiving the plates, the young prophet struggled with his desires. In 1832 he wrote:

&lt;i&gt;I had been tempted of the adversary and sought the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandment that I should have an eye single to the glory of God therefore I was chastened and sought diligently to obtain the plates and obtained them not until I was twenty one years of age.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, &lt;/i&gt;comp. Dean C. Jessee (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1984), p. 7]

The Lord saw into the heart of the young prophet, chastened him for his improper desires, gave him time to repent and mature, and eventually forgave him and allowed him to continue his mission.

Many scriptures reveal how the thoughts of our hearts will be relevant on the day of judgment. Alma taught that when we are brought before the bar of God to be judged, our works, our words, and our thoughts will all condemn us (see Alma 12:12, 14).

Two of my favorite verses of scripture are in the Twenty-fourth Psalm:

&lt;i&gt;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.&lt;/i&gt;

[Psalms 24:34; see also Alma 5:19]

If we refrain from evil acts, we have clean hands. If we refrain from forbidden thoughts, we have pure hearts. Those who would ascend and stand in the ultimate holy place must have both.

In the second chapter of Romans, the Apostle Paul teaches to the same effect. He explains that God will "judge the secrets of men" (Romans 2:16) "according to truth" (Romans 2:2). He contrasts the position of the Gentiles who do not have the Mosaic law but by their actions "shew the work of the law written in their hearts" (Romans 2:15) with those Jews who preach the law and then do not practice it. The Apostle Paul then concludes with these profound truths:

&lt;i&gt;For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. &lt;/i&gt;[Romans 2:2829]

What do these teachings about feelings and desires mean for each of us?

Are we sure to be guiltless under the law of God if we merely refrain from evil acts? What if we entertain evil thoughts and desires?

Will hateful feelings go unnoticed in the day of judgment? Will envy? Will covetousness?

Are we guiltless if we engage in business practices that are intended to deceive, even though they involve no act that is punishable by law?

Are we guiltless under the law of God just because the law of man provides no legal remedy for our victim?

Are we eligible for blessings if we seem to seek the things of God, such as by preaching or publishing the message of the gospel, but do so to obtain riches or honor rather than with an eye single to his glory?

Our answers to such questions illustrate what we might call the bad news, that we can sin without overt acts, merely by our feelings and the desires of our hearts.

There is also good news. Under the law of God, we can be rewarded for righteousness even where we are unable to perform the acts that are usually associated with such blessings.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blessings for Righteous Desires&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
When someone genuinely wanted to do something for my father-in-law but was prevented by circumstances, he would say: "Thank you. I will take the good will for the deed." Similarly, I believe that our Father in Heaven will receive the true desires of our hearts as a substitute for actions that are genuinely impossible.

Here we see another contrast between the laws of God and the laws of men. It is entirely impractical to grant a &lt;i&gt;legal &lt;/i&gt;advantage on the basis of an intent not translated into action. "I intended to sign that contract" or "We intended to get married" cannot stand as the equivalent of the act required by law. If the law were to give effect to intentions in lieu of specific acts, it would open the door for too much abuse, since the laws of man have no reliable means of determining our innermost thoughts.

In contrast, the &lt;i&gt;law of God &lt;/i&gt;can reward a righteous desire because an omniscient God can discern it. As revealed through the prophet of this dispensation, God "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (D&amp;amp;C 33:1). If a person refrains from a particular act because he is genuinely unable to perform it, but truly would if he could, our Heavenly Father will know this and can reward that person accordingly.

Perhaps the best scriptural illustration of this is King Benjamins teaching about giving:

&lt;i&gt;And again, I say unto the poor. &lt;/i&gt;. . &lt;i&gt;all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless. &lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 4:2425]

Paul described the same principle in his second letter to the Corinthians: "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not" (2 Corinthians 8:12).

President Harold B. Lee relied on these scriptures in another example:

[Women] &lt;i&gt;who have been denied the blessings of wifehood or motherhood in this life - who say in their heart, if I could have done, I would have done, or I would give if I had, but I cannot for I have not - the Lord will bless you as though you had done, and the world to come will compensate for those who desire in their hearts the righteous blessings that they were not able to have because of no fault of their own. &lt;/i&gt;[Harold B. Lee, &lt;i&gt;Ye Are the Light of the World &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974), p. 292]

The desires of our hearts will be an important consideration in the final judgment. Alma taught that God "granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; . . . according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. Yea, . . . he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires" (Alma 29:45).

That is a sobering teaching, but it is also a gratifying one. It means that when we have &lt;i&gt;done &lt;/i&gt;all that we can, our &lt;i&gt;desires &lt;/i&gt;will carry us the rest of the way. It also means that if our desires are right, we can be forgiven for the mistakes we will inevitably make as we try to carry those desires into effect. What a comfort for our feelings of inadequacy! As Alma said:

&lt;i&gt;It is requisite with the justice of God that. &lt;/i&gt;. . &lt;i&gt;if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 41:3, 6]

Similarly, in this dispensation the Lord has revealed that he "will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts" (D&amp;amp;C 137:9).

I caution against two possible misunderstandings: First, we must remember that desire is a substitute only when action is truly impossible. If we attempt to use impossibility of action as a cover for our lack of true desire and therefore do not do all that we can to perform the acts that have been commanded, we may deceive ourselves, but we will not deceive the Righteous Judge.

In order to serve as a substitute for action, desire cannot be superficial, impulsive, or temporary. It must be heartfelt, through and through. To be efficacious for blessings, the desires of our hearts must be so genuine that they can be called godly.

Second, we should not assume that the desires of our hearts can serve as a substitute for an ordinance of the gospel. Consider the words of the Lord in commanding two gospel ordinances: "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). And in respect to the three degrees in the celestial glory, modern revelation states, "In order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]" (D&amp;amp;C 131:2). No exception is implied in these commands or authorized elsewhere in the scriptures.

In the justice and mercy of God, these rigid commands pertaining to essential ordinances are tempered by divine authorization to perform those ordinances by proxy for those who did not have them performed in this life. Thus, a person in the spirit world who so desires is credited with participating in the ordinance just as if he or she had done so personally. In this manner, through the loving service of living proxies, departed spirits are also rewarded for the desires of their hearts.

In summary, under the law of God we are accountable for our feelings and desires as well as our acts. Evil thoughts and desires will be punished. Acts that seem to be good bring blessings only when they are done with real and righteous intent. On the positive side, we will be blessed for the righteous desires of our hearts even though some outside circumstance has made it impossible for us to carry those desires into action.

To paraphrase Pauls teaching in Romans 2:29, he is a true Latter-day Saint who is one inwardly, whose conversion is that of the spirit, in the heart, whose praise is not of men for outward acts, but of God, for the inward desires of the heart.

May God bless us to understand this great principle and to act upon it. It challenges us. It comforts us. It is true.

God lives. Jesus Christ is his Son. He suffered and died for our sins, that through repentance, through good works, through the righteous desires of our hearts, and through compliance with all the laws and ordinances of the gospel, we may attain to the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom. That is the destiny of the children of God. Of that I bear testimony as I ask the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon each of us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Each of us desires the ultimate blessing of exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Even when we fall short, we desire what is right. That is my subject - "The Desires of Our Hearts."</p>
<p>I am interested in this subject because it highlights a critical contrast between the laws of God, as revealed in the scriptures, and what I will call the laws of man, as set out in the national and state laws with which I was concerned in my thirty years in the legal profession.</p>
<h2><b>Laws - Mans and Gods</b></h2>
<p>The laws of man are never concerned about a persons desires or thoughts in isolation. When the law inquires into a persons state of mind or intent, it only seeks to determine what consequence should be assigned to particular actions that person has taken.</p>
<p>In contrast, the laws of God are concerned with spiritual things. Spiritual consequences are affected by actions, but they are also affected by desires or thoughts, independent of actions. Gospel consequences flow from the desires of our hearts.</p>
<p>A simple example will illustrate that contrast. Suppose your neighbor has a beautiful sports car parked in his driveway. You take no action. You just look on that car longingly, and covet it. You have sinned. You have broken one of the Ten Commandments (see Exodus 20:17). Eternal consequences follow.</p>
<p>Up to this point you have not broken any of the laws of man. However, if you take a particular action, such as jumping the ignition wires and driving away in the car, you will have committed a wrong that could be punished or redressed under the laws of man.</p>
<p>To determine what consequence should be assigned to your action, the law would attempt to determine your intent in taking the car. If you simply intended to borrow the car in the mistaken belief that your neighbor would consent, you might not be guilty of a crime. However, you would surely be liable for damages for the wrongful use of the car. If you intended to use the car contrary to the wishes of the owner and yet return it in a short time, you would have committed a minor crime. If you intended to take the car permanently, you would have committed a major crime. To choose among these various alternatives, a judge or jury would attempt to determine your state of mind.</p>
<p>This simple example makes the point that the laws of man will sometimes inquire into a persons state of mind in order to determine the consequences of particular actions, but the law will never punish or give effect to intent or desires standing alone. It was so in Book of Mormon times. As we read in Alma, the people of Nephi could be punished for their criminal actions, but "there was no law against a mans belief" (Alma 30:11).</p>
<p>It is good that this is so. The law is an imperfect instrument. It has no reliable way to look into a persons heart.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gods law can assign consequences solely on the basis of our innermost thoughts and desires. There is no uncertainty in the administration of this law. As Ammon taught King Lamoni, God "looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning" (Alma 18:32).</p>
<p>Similarly, Paul warned the Hebrews that God "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart," and "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him" (Hebrews 4:1213).</p>
<p>In other words, God judges us not only for our acts, but also for the desires of our hearts. He has said so again and again. This is a challenging reality, but it is not surprising. Agency and accountability are eternal principles. We exercise our free agency not only by what we <i>do, </i>but also by what we <i>decide, </i>or <i>will, </i>or <i>desire. </i>Restrictions on freedom can deprive us of the power <i>to do, </i>but no one can deprive us of the power to <i>will </i>or <i>desire. </i>Accountability must therefore reach and attach consequences to the desires of our hearts.</p>
<p>This principle applies both in a negative way - making us guilty of sin for evil thoughts and desires - and in a positive way - promising us blessings for righteous desires.</p>
<h2><b>Sins of Desire</b></h2>
<p>The best-known scriptural designation of sin on the basis of the desires of our hearts concerns sexual sin. The Savior declared:</p>
<p><i>Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;</i></p>
<p><i>But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart. </i>[3 Nephi 12:2728; see also Matthew 5:2728]</p>
<p>The New Testament also condemns anger and unrighteous feelings - another example of sins committed solely on the basis of thoughts (see Matthew 5:22).</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon illustrates this same principle in its definition of priestcraft, the sin committed by those who preach the gospel to gain personal advantage rather than to further the work of the Lord:</p>
<p><i>Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion. </i>[2 Nephi 26:29; see also Alma 1:16]</p>
<p>Priestcraft is not a sin that is committed solely on the basis of our desires because it involves acts. Those acts becomes sinful only when they are done with the wrong desire, to get gain or praise. The sin is in the desire, not in the act.</p>
<p>The same is true of those who draw near to the Lord with their lips but have removed their hearts far from him. (See Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:8; 2 Nephi 27:25; JS - H 1:19.) Likewise, the Psalmist condemned the people of ancient Israel because "their heart was not right with [God]" (Psalms 78:37).</p>
<p>When is our heart right with God? Our heart is right with God when we truly desire what is righteous - when we desire what God desires.</p>
<h2><b>Educating Our Desires</b></h2>
<p>Our divinely granted willpower gives us control over our desires, but it may take many years for us to be sure that we have willed and educated them to the point that all are entirely righteous.</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith taught that the "education. . . of our desires is one of far-reaching importance to our happiness in life" (Joseph F. Smith, <i>Gospel Doctrine </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 297).</p>
<p>How do we educate our desires? We begin, I suppose, with our feelings. The desires of our hearts are deep-seated and fundamental. But our feelings are closer to the surface and easier for us to identify and influence.</p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself doing something you thought was right, but doing it because you "had" to? Did you ever keep a commandment of God with an attitude of resentment or self-righteousness, or even because you expected some immediate personal benefit? I suppose most of us have had this experience. Do you remember your feelings on such occasions? Do you think such feelings will be ignored by a Father in Heaven who gave us the willpower we call agency? Dont such feelings tell us something about the desires of our hearts?</p>
<p>In order to have righteous desires, we have to control our thoughts and achieve appropriate feelings. My widowed mother understood that principle. "Pray about your feelings," she used to say. She taught her three children that we should pray to have the right kind of feelings about our experiences - positive or negative - and about the people we knew. If our feelings were right, we would be more likely to take right actions and to act for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Mormon teaches that if our heart is not right, even a good action is not counted for righteousness.</p>
<p><i>For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, </i>. . . <i>except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.</i></p>
<p><i>For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.</i></p>
<p><i>For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God. </i>[Moroni 7:68]</p>
<p>In other words, we must not only act, we must act for the right reasons. There are no blessings for actions taken without real intent.</p>
<p>Mormon even applied this principle to our prayers.</p>
<p><i>And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth nonesuch. </i>[Moroni 7:9]</p>
<p>When Joseph Smith first went to Cumorah, the angel refused to give him the plates, saying it was not yet time. During the years he had to wait before receiving the plates, the young prophet struggled with his desires. In 1832 he wrote:</p>
<p><i>I had been tempted of the adversary and sought the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandment that I should have an eye single to the glory of God therefore I was chastened and sought diligently to obtain the plates and obtained them not until I was twenty one years of age.</i> [<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, </i>comp. Dean C. Jessee (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1984), p. 7]</p>
<p>The Lord saw into the heart of the young prophet, chastened him for his improper desires, gave him time to repent and mature, and eventually forgave him and allowed him to continue his mission.</p>
<p>Many scriptures reveal how the thoughts of our hearts will be relevant on the day of judgment. Alma taught that when we are brought before the bar of God to be judged, our works, our words, and our thoughts will all condemn us (see Alma 12:12, 14).</p>
<p>Two of my favorite verses of scripture are in the Twenty-fourth Psalm:</p>
<p><i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?</i></p>
<p><i>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.</i></p>
<p>[Psalms 24:34; see also Alma 5:19]</p>
<p>If we refrain from evil acts, we have clean hands. If we refrain from forbidden thoughts, we have pure hearts. Those who would ascend and stand in the ultimate holy place must have both.</p>
<p>In the second chapter of Romans, the Apostle Paul teaches to the same effect. He explains that God will "judge the secrets of men" (Romans 2:16) "according to truth" (Romans 2:2). He contrasts the position of the Gentiles who do not have the Mosaic law but by their actions "shew the work of the law written in their hearts" (Romans 2:15) with those Jews who preach the law and then do not practice it. The Apostle Paul then concludes with these profound truths:</p>
<p><i>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</i></p>
<p><i>But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. </i>[Romans 2:2829]</p>
<p>What do these teachings about feelings and desires mean for each of us?</p>
<p>Are we sure to be guiltless under the law of God if we merely refrain from evil acts? What if we entertain evil thoughts and desires?</p>
<p>Will hateful feelings go unnoticed in the day of judgment? Will envy? Will covetousness?</p>
<p>Are we guiltless if we engage in business practices that are intended to deceive, even though they involve no act that is punishable by law?</p>
<p>Are we guiltless under the law of God just because the law of man provides no legal remedy for our victim?</p>
<p>Are we eligible for blessings if we seem to seek the things of God, such as by preaching or publishing the message of the gospel, but do so to obtain riches or honor rather than with an eye single to his glory?</p>
<p>Our answers to such questions illustrate what we might call the bad news, that we can sin without overt acts, merely by our feelings and the desires of our hearts.</p>
<p>There is also good news. Under the law of God, we can be rewarded for righteousness even where we are unable to perform the acts that are usually associated with such blessings.</p>
<h2><b>Blessings for Righteous Desires</b></h2>
<p>When someone genuinely wanted to do something for my father-in-law but was prevented by circumstances, he would say: "Thank you. I will take the good will for the deed." Similarly, I believe that our Father in Heaven will receive the true desires of our hearts as a substitute for actions that are genuinely impossible.</p>
<p>Here we see another contrast between the laws of God and the laws of men. It is entirely impractical to grant a <i>legal </i>advantage on the basis of an intent not translated into action. "I intended to sign that contract" or "We intended to get married" cannot stand as the equivalent of the act required by law. If the law were to give effect to intentions in lieu of specific acts, it would open the door for too much abuse, since the laws of man have no reliable means of determining our innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <i>law of God </i>can reward a righteous desire because an omniscient God can discern it. As revealed through the prophet of this dispensation, God "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (D&amp;C 33:1). If a person refrains from a particular act because he is genuinely unable to perform it, but truly would if he could, our Heavenly Father will know this and can reward that person accordingly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best scriptural illustration of this is King Benjamins teaching about giving:</p>
<p><i>And again, I say unto the poor. </i>. . <i>all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</i></p>
<p><i>And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless. </i>[Mosiah 4:2425]</p>
<p>Paul described the same principle in his second letter to the Corinthians: "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not" (2 Corinthians 8:12).</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee relied on these scriptures in another example:</p>
<p>[Women] <i>who have been denied the blessings of wifehood or motherhood in this life - who say in their heart, if I could have done, I would have done, or I would give if I had, but I cannot for I have not - the Lord will bless you as though you had done, and the world to come will compensate for those who desire in their hearts the righteous blessings that they were not able to have because of no fault of their own. </i>[Harold B. Lee, <i>Ye Are the Light of the World </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974), p. 292]</p>
<p>The desires of our hearts will be an important consideration in the final judgment. Alma taught that God "granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; . . . according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. Yea, . . . he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires" (Alma 29:45).</p>
<p>That is a sobering teaching, but it is also a gratifying one. It means that when we have <i>done </i>all that we can, our <i>desires </i>will carry us the rest of the way. It also means that if our desires are right, we can be forgiven for the mistakes we will inevitably make as we try to carry those desires into effect. What a comfort for our feelings of inadequacy! As Alma said:</p>
<p><i>It is requisite with the justice of God that. </i>. . <i>if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</i></p>
<p><i>If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness. </i>[Alma 41:3, 6]</p>
<p>Similarly, in this dispensation the Lord has revealed that he "will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts" (D&amp;C 137:9).</p>
<p>I caution against two possible misunderstandings: First, we must remember that desire is a substitute only when action is truly impossible. If we attempt to use impossibility of action as a cover for our lack of true desire and therefore do not do all that we can to perform the acts that have been commanded, we may deceive ourselves, but we will not deceive the Righteous Judge.</p>
<p>In order to serve as a substitute for action, desire cannot be superficial, impulsive, or temporary. It must be heartfelt, through and through. To be efficacious for blessings, the desires of our hearts must be so genuine that they can be called godly.</p>
<p>Second, we should not assume that the desires of our hearts can serve as a substitute for an ordinance of the gospel. Consider the words of the Lord in commanding two gospel ordinances: "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). And in respect to the three degrees in the celestial glory, modern revelation states, "In order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]" (D&amp;C 131:2). No exception is implied in these commands or authorized elsewhere in the scriptures.</p>
<p>In the justice and mercy of God, these rigid commands pertaining to essential ordinances are tempered by divine authorization to perform those ordinances by proxy for those who did not have them performed in this life. Thus, a person in the spirit world who so desires is credited with participating in the ordinance just as if he or she had done so personally. In this manner, through the loving service of living proxies, departed spirits are also rewarded for the desires of their hearts.</p>
<p>In summary, under the law of God we are accountable for our feelings and desires as well as our acts. Evil thoughts and desires will be punished. Acts that seem to be good bring blessings only when they are done with real and righteous intent. On the positive side, we will be blessed for the righteous desires of our hearts even though some outside circumstance has made it impossible for us to carry those desires into action.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Pauls teaching in Romans 2:29, he is a true Latter-day Saint who is one inwardly, whose conversion is that of the spirit, in the heart, whose praise is not of men for outward acts, but of God, for the inward desires of the heart.</p>
<p>May God bless us to understand this great principle and to act upon it. It challenges us. It comforts us. It is true.</p>
<p>God lives. Jesus Christ is his Son. He suffered and died for our sins, that through repentance, through good works, through the righteous desires of our hearts, and through compliance with all the laws and ordinances of the gospel, we may attain to the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom. That is the destiny of the children of God. Of that I bear testimony as I ask the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon each of us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Humans are creatures of habit. We all have habits that affect the way we dress and groom ourselves, how and what we eat, how we travel to the university each day, and how we go about our work. In addition we have recreational and entertainment habits, reading and study habits, and even prayer habits. Just as we have habitual ways of behaving, we also have habitual ways of thinking. President Howard W. Hunter acknowledged the existence of thinking habits when he declared, "Outward circumstances do not determine the course of our lives as much as the thoughts that habitually occupy our minds."1
In 1910 John Dewey wrote the book How We Think, in which he described some of the ways that thinking habits influence the way people think. In recent years other scholars have elaborated on the idea of thinking habits.2
Scholars who have tried to create programs designed to teach people to think better have discovered that many people already possess the skills needed to think effectively. What they lacked was not the necessary abilities but the commitment and the willingness to invest their time and effort in using the thinking skills they had already acquired. This finding led researchers to conclude that people have dispositions that influence the way they think.3 Consequently, many scholars today believe that effective thinking includes both intellectual skills and positive dispositions regarding the use of such skills. For my purposes today, I shall treat habits of mind and thinking dispositions as being essentially synonymous and interchangeable.
Shari Tishman and her colleagues at Harvard define thinking dispositions as "abiding tendencies toward distinct patterns of thinking behaviors."4 Hence a thinking disposition is a consistent tendency or inclination to think in certain ways. Thinking dispositions are somewhat stable and generalizable. To be disposed to think in a certain manner means that an individual has a consistent tendency to employ the same thinking pattern in different situations and on different occasions. For example, some people are disposed to be analytical and skeptical. They typically try to examine the available evidence before deciding whether to accept a proposition. Other people may be prone to rationalize. They make up their mind first and then search for evidence to support their chosen point of view while ignoring any evidence to the contrary.5
Let me call your attention to an instance in the New Testament that provides an interesting example of a thinking habit. When Jesus described the Pharisees as being "blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel" (Matthew 23:24), he was doing more than just using figurative language. He was accusing them of having a tendency to make mountains out of molehills when it was to their advantage, and to make molehills out of mountains when that was to their advantage. In </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I need to start with a little confession. My wife, Ann, and I are tyrants. We want our three children to play the piano, and we stop just short of shackling their ankles to the bench to make sure that happens. The other night as we were driving home from an especially dismal piano lesson, I was haranguing my two sons over their sad performance and obvious lack of preparation. As soon as I took a breath, my 11-year-old seized the opportunity to adjust my thinking.
"Okay, Dad, I had a bad lesson tonight. But, do you know what? I dont care."
Where had he learned to express himself so clearly? My firstborn apparently possesses not an ounce of desire to excel at the piano, in spite of years of coaxing and persuasion from his parents. Can any of you relate? Does "You will thank me later for making you practice" sound familiar to you? Or "You will be grateful you learned to play the hymns when you hit the mission field." Ever heard that?
I am counting on Adams heart softening toward the piano as he matures, because he is actually quite talented. I have the feeling that he will go through the same cycle of change that I did, eventually developing a very personal, internal desire to master the piano for the love of music and what it does for his soul. But, for now, my wife and I accept the fact that he will need steady external motivation if we expect to see any progress. Adam will practice the piano because we force him to.
I wonder why you do the things you do. Why did you practice the piano? Why did you quit practicing the piano? Why do you wear your hair that way? Why are you in college? Why are you dating that particular girl?
As a freshman at BYU, I remember going to bed that first Saturday night in my ultracompact Helaman Halls room and realizing that I could decide whether or not to get up for nine oclock church the next morning. Mom and Dad were in California and would have no idea whether I went or not.
The decision to get up on Sunday morning was strictly up to me, dictated by the internal desires of my heart. It is really the same with every choice we make. People around us see the choice itself, but only we know why we made that choice. In contrast to our childhood years, when many of our choices were made with little thought or were based on some external motivator - such as our parents or teachers or maybe a best friend - the more mature and independent we become, the more personal responsibility we have for our choices and the more those choices are governed by the motives that lie within our own hearts. Although external forces will always lean on our behavior, they become more and more subservient to the personal, heartfelt desires we carry inside of us.
President James E. Faust explained:
We must at times search our own souls and discover what we really are. Our real character, much as we would wish, cannot be hidden. It shines from </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Im reminded of a survey that I recently heard of in which people were asked to list their greatest fears. The majority of those surveyed listed giving a talk as that which they feared most. The second most feared activity was that of dying. I suppose that one could deduce from the study that most people would rather die than give a talk.
Preparation for this devotional has been a most interesting experience. It has given me the chance to more closely focus on an area that is becoming increasingly important to me. I seek for your faith and prayers that what I have prepared will be presented clearly and that you will find value in its content.
During my 26 years as a faculty member at BYU I have discovered that age is a relative matter. If you continue to work and absorb the beauty in the world about you, you find that age does not necessarily mean getting old. Rather it refers to a continual process of developing and maturing. In my case it refers to an ever-increasing desire to fill my mind with things that will make life more productive and meaningful. Age has taught me the importance of using all that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13) to create a shield in my mind that can ward off temptation and assist me in drawing closer to God and his Son Jesus Christ.
Today I want to share with you some reasons for, as well as examples of, using two areas of the fine arts - visual representation and music - to give us increased ability to make our lives better and more productive, especially as they relate to our purpose here: to become like Christ.
There is no profession more important than that of teaching. At any level it is a great responsibility. Good teachers help shape and give direction to the lives of their students.
One of the principles that plays such an important part in the process of teaching is that there are some things teachers can give to students rather easily and some things they cannot give, except as the students are willing to reach out, grab, and take hold of an object or thought - thus beginning to pay the price for making it an integral part of their lives.
It is a wonderfully rewarding experience to see the "light go on" in a students eyes after seeing them grapple and come to grips with a problem or a new experience. On the other hand, it is a disheartening experience to see a student who, when exposed to that which is "of good report or praiseworthy," rejects it because, paraphrasing the American composer Charles Ives, they seek only that which allows the ears to "lie back in an easy chair" (Charles Ives, as quoted by Joseph Machlis in The Enjoyment of Music [New York: Norton, 1977], p. 566).
There are few things that require concentration or extra effort that are comfortable or convenient. Those people who do not want to put themselves out or "seek" for that which is "of good report or prais</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Janet: Let me tell you of an experience that I had on this campus when I was a student. The setting was a beautiful, sunny spring morning in my dorm room. As my roommate and I were getting ready for the day, we were discussing our activities of the previous evening. I had just had my first date with a recently returned missionary who was a little hard for me to figure out. He was different from anyone I had ever dated.
"Would you go out with him again if he asked you?" my roommate inquired. As I was searching for an answer, the phone rang. It was for me, and as I put the receiver to my ear, this is what I heard.
(Rex Lee and Larry Shumway singing)
I tried so hard, my dear, to show
That youre my every dream,
Yet every time I see your face
It makes me want to scream.
You look much better to me, dear, 
The further were apart.
Your liver may be warm,
But youve got a cold, cold heart.
Youll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry,
But you could cry much better
If you had another eye.
When I see you walk in the room
It makes my eyeballs smart
Why dont you go fall off your broom 
And break your cold, cold heart.
The song ended and no one spoke. In fact, the connection was dead at the other end of the line. I wasnt certain who the "musicians" were, but I thought I recognized an Arizona twang in at least one of the voices. Could that have been my date from the night before? Was this his way of telling me that I was cold and unfriendly? Where in the world did he dig up that song, anyway? Was he trying to say, "I never want to see you again"? What kind of person would call, sing that ridiculous song, and then hang up? Too strange for me, I decided, and gave an emphatic "no" to my roommates earlier question.
Rex: She was, of course, dead wrong. Singing that particular song was the highest compliment we could have paid her, and she should have been profoundly flattered. Let me explain why. My duet partner was and is Larry Shumway, now the chairman of our humanities department and then my roommate with whom I had grown up in St. Johns, Arizona. For whatever reason, it was very difficult for us to tell our dates that we liked them. So, for those we really liked, we sang to them over the telephone. We didnt try to give an explanation because thats what was hard for us to do. We just sang and then hung up. Nothing more. The words of the song we picked were irrelevant. The significant thing was that we sang. That Homer and Jethro version of "Cold, Cold Heart" was distinctive only in that musically it was the best in our repertoire. Therefore, by singing her that song, we were paying her the highest compliment we could pay. She should have considere</span>
