  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a pleasure to welcome all of you back to Brigham Young University in 2006. It is a new year and a time for many resolutions to improve and change, but hopefully most of these are made throughout the year when needed and appropriate. For all of you 2006 is a year for realizing countless opportunities, setting goals, and anticipating accomplishments. It will present many choices and decisions for you. They are yours to grasp, make, and lead you forward - if you always remember to seek and do the Lords will amidst the challenges and excitement of life each and every day. It is both my husbands and my wish that this year of your time here at the university will be a wonderful and successful one.

It was a little over a year ago when the devastating tsunami occurred in parts of Asia. We were all shocked and saddened by this news. Our hearts were deeply touched as we witnessed the devastation and loss of life as well the examples of compassion and goodness of people throughout the world seeking to help those who were suffering. A few days following the tragedy, I was watching a television program that was describing and discussing the tsunami and its aftermath. I cant recall the names or titles of the participants on the program; however, I vividly recall - and have never forgotten - a response to a question by the commentator given by a woman associated with and knowledgeable about the efforts being done to help the victims as well as to account for those who had lost their lives.

The interviewer put forth this question: "Can you give an estimate of how many lives have probably been lost as a result of this natural disaster?"

Her response was, "In many parts of the area where much damage was done, people are not counted in life; therefore, it is impossible to count them in death."

My first thought after a short and shocked hesitation - caused by the bluntness of her answer - was: "You are wrong. You neither are knowledgeable about nor understand the Lords magnificent plan of salvation. If only you really knew that our Heavenly Father counts each one of these men, women, and children as His son or daughter."

We are instructed in the Doctrine and Covenants and reassured many, many times throughout the scriptures to "remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&amp;amp;C 18:10). These souls include those who may never have had the opportunity in mortality to hear the message of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the principles of the gospel it teaches. As I listened to that program, I was so thankful for my testimony of these principles and the knowledge that all who have lived, are living, and will yet live in this earthly realm are sons and daughters of a loving Father in Heaven.

There have been times in my life when I have been in the midst of hundreds or thousands of people: for example, at a football game in LaVell Edwards Stadium, with 65,000 people screaming and cheering; a crowded metropolis at Christmastime with people scurrying in and out of stores shopping for gifts; or a busy airport with people hurrying to catch planes headed in a multitude of directions. You have had these experiences too. Maybe you too have felt as I have at times and also pondered the thought "I am but one person among all these hundreds and thousands of people." Then the mind tries to comprehend the millions and billions who have gone before, who are here now, and who will people the earth in the future. Have you at times asked yourselves, as I have, "Am I really that important? Just how much is my worth as I lead my life?"

This soul-searching question is answered in John 3:16, where we are taught that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" so we could have eternal life. We know that we are spirit children of an exalted, glorified being who is our Father in Heaven. The Lord counts us all in life as well as in death - as He does the victims of the tsunami - and because we know who we are, we know why we are here: to strive to return one day to dwell in His presence. And this is what He desires for us too.

The Lord loves each one of us. We are His own. Moses was told by the Lord that He created our world and its inhabitants and that all are His (see Moses 1:35). How blessed we are to have such knowledge. Listen to the words of a beautiful woman who gained this awareness as she struggled with her own self-worth and understanding of who she was:

&lt;i&gt;As a convert, the hymn "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" was sung at the very first sacrament meeting I attended as a brand-new member of the Church. For the first 18 years of my life I struggled with my worth and with who I was and what my importance was to anyone. I had been told I was the ugliest girl in my school, and I carried that label with me for many years. As I took the missionary discussions, I learned enough of the gospel plan to know it was true and right. At my first sacrament meeting when the third verse of that hymn was sung, I knew in that moment for the first time who I really was and what my importance was. That moment changed everything for me. Nothing on the outside changed, but everything on the inside did. I was part of His plan, His offering. And I hold a place within His Heart.&lt;/i&gt; [Personal communication]

The world in which we live today tells us that our sense of worth is based upon what is seen or accomplished. We are measured by possessions and wealth, physical appearance and dress styles, social status and achievements. Too many of us strive to gain acceptance using these standards, trying to enhance the perception of our worth by those who are part of our lives as well as those who view us from afar. If we are not careful, we can let others determine and establish our standards and feelings of self-worth. We can become someone elses image of success rather than our own.

President Harold B. Lee often quoted Harry Emerson Fosdicks description of a prayer of an old Edinburgh weaver: "O God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself" (Harry Emerson Fosdick, &lt;i&gt;Twelve Tests of Character&lt;/i&gt; [New York: Association Press, 1941], 35; see Harold B. Lee, "Understanding Who We Are Brings Self-Respect," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; January 1974, 4). In other words, the weaver prayed that he would value himself for what he was rather than for the opinions held by others. William Shakespeare also said:

&lt;i&gt;This above all: to thine own self be true,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it must follow, as the night the day,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thou canst not then be false to any man.&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;Hamlet,&lt;/i&gt; act 1, scene 3, lines 7880]

As university students you are dealing with the worldly requirements for success every day. Therefore, if you do not constantly remind yourselves of what is of true value and worth, you can lose perspective and insight as you forge ahead into the future. Sister Patricia Holland, speaking in a Brigham Young University devotional, stated:

&lt;i&gt;We are becoming so concerned about having perfect figures, or straight As, or professional status . . . that we are being torn from our true selves. We often worry so much about pleasing and performing for others that we lose our own uniqueness, that full and relaxed acceptance of ourselves as a person of worth and individuality.&lt;/i&gt; [Patricia T. Holland, "The Souls Center" (13 January 1987), &lt;i&gt;BYU 198687 Devotional and Fireside Speeches&lt;/i&gt; (Provo: BYU, 1987), 84]

My dear friends, I worry that we often forget that each one of us is inherently of great worth because we are children of God. It is easy to forget if we listen to the voices of the worlds values that surround us. Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it best: "Some among us mistakenly see the size and response of their audiences as the sole verification of their worth" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Irony: The Crust on the Bread of Adversity," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1989, 63).

Often these audiences would lead us to have a false sense of worth. This is evident today in the media messages as well as in the examples of many around us who live in and seek notoriety. The values of virtue, chastity, modesty, integrity, faith, love, and respect, among many others, are not perceived as worthwhile by so many today. The world would judge us to be of more worth by what we have than by what is in our hearts. It would have us reject these God-given values in favor of others that could lead us away from righteousness and positive feelings of self-worth.

The Lord has warned us in the scriptures that we are seeking the things of the world rather than seeking Him when we place the greatest value on riches and the praises of men. We are told that many are not chosen by the Lord "because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and [they] aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;amp;C 121:35).

It is invaluable to each one of us that we always know and never forget that the measure of our worth is in our divine heritage. The gospel teaches us that our true worth is based upon its teachings and principles. We do not need the world to tell us whether we are successful and worthwhile or not.

The Lord does desire for us to be successful in our righteous endeavors - whether temporal or spiritual. There are many things of the world that are pleasing in His sight - such as gaining knowledge and wisdom as you study here - but one must never forget that the source of all these things is the Lord, and thus we should show Him gratitude. Showing gratitude to the Lord helps us better see our worth in His sight.

We strengthen our sense of worth by being dignified in the lives we lead and by following the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ. As we rely upon our Savior for guidance and His deep love for us in all we do, our feelings of personal worth will be expressed in the lives we lead, and we then bless others by our example and service.

Our eternal worth is given to us by God. We do not have to let it be determined by others - only by God and ourselves. We can lose sight of our self-worth if we do not keep the commandments and consequently disregard the divinity within us. The focus of the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ, is each one of us, as expressed in the book of Moses: "For behold, this is my work and my glory - to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).

In conclusion, let me recite to you from the third verse of "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" that reminded my friend of her true self-worth - as it should remind all of us:

&lt;i&gt;Oh, love effulgent, love divine!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What debt of gratitude is mine,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That in his offring I have part&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And hold a place within his heart.&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 187]

It is my prayer that each of us may know of our worth to those who truly love us, especially our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>It is a pleasure to welcome all of you back to Brigham Young University in 2006. It is a new year and a time for many resolutions to improve and change, but hopefully most of these are made throughout the year when needed and appropriate. For all of you 2006 is a year for realizing countless opportunities, setting goals, and anticipating accomplishments. It will present many choices and decisions for you. They are yours to grasp, make, and lead you forward - if you always remember to seek and do the Lords will amidst the challenges and excitement of life each and every day. It is both my husbands and my wish that this year of your time here at the university will be a wonderful and successful one.</p>
<p>It was a little over a year ago when the devastating tsunami occurred in parts of Asia. We were all shocked and saddened by this news. Our hearts were deeply touched as we witnessed the devastation and loss of life as well the examples of compassion and goodness of people throughout the world seeking to help those who were suffering. A few days following the tragedy, I was watching a television program that was describing and discussing the tsunami and its aftermath. I cant recall the names or titles of the participants on the program; however, I vividly recall - and have never forgotten - a response to a question by the commentator given by a woman associated with and knowledgeable about the efforts being done to help the victims as well as to account for those who had lost their lives.</p>
<p>The interviewer put forth this question: "Can you give an estimate of how many lives have probably been lost as a result of this natural disaster?"</p>
<p>Her response was, "In many parts of the area where much damage was done, people are not counted in life; therefore, it is impossible to count them in death."</p>
<p>My first thought after a short and shocked hesitation - caused by the bluntness of her answer - was: "You are wrong. You neither are knowledgeable about nor understand the Lords magnificent plan of salvation. If only you really knew that our Heavenly Father counts each one of these men, women, and children as His son or daughter."</p>
<p>We are instructed in the Doctrine and Covenants and reassured many, many times throughout the scriptures to "remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&amp;C 18:10). These souls include those who may never have had the opportunity in mortality to hear the message of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the principles of the gospel it teaches. As I listened to that program, I was so thankful for my testimony of these principles and the knowledge that all who have lived, are living, and will yet live in this earthly realm are sons and daughters of a loving Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>There have been times in my life when I have been in the midst of hundreds or thousands of people: for example, at a football game in LaVell Edwards Stadium, with 65,000 people screaming and cheering; a crowded metropolis at Christmastime with people scurrying in and out of stores shopping for gifts; or a busy airport with people hurrying to catch planes headed in a multitude of directions. You have had these experiences too. Maybe you too have felt as I have at times and also pondered the thought "I am but one person among all these hundreds and thousands of people." Then the mind tries to comprehend the millions and billions who have gone before, who are here now, and who will people the earth in the future. Have you at times asked yourselves, as I have, "Am I really that important? Just how much is my worth as I lead my life?"</p>
<p>This soul-searching question is answered in John 3:16, where we are taught that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" so we could have eternal life. We know that we are spirit children of an exalted, glorified being who is our Father in Heaven. The Lord counts us all in life as well as in death - as He does the victims of the tsunami - and because we know who we are, we know why we are here: to strive to return one day to dwell in His presence. And this is what He desires for us too.</p>
<p>The Lord loves each one of us. We are His own. Moses was told by the Lord that He created our world and its inhabitants and that all are His (see Moses 1:35). How blessed we are to have such knowledge. Listen to the words of a beautiful woman who gained this awareness as she struggled with her own self-worth and understanding of who she was:</p>
<p><i>As a convert, the hymn "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" was sung at the very first sacrament meeting I attended as a brand-new member of the Church. For the first 18 years of my life I struggled with my worth and with who I was and what my importance was to anyone. I had been told I was the ugliest girl in my school, and I carried that label with me for many years. As I took the missionary discussions, I learned enough of the gospel plan to know it was true and right. At my first sacrament meeting when the third verse of that hymn was sung, I knew in that moment for the first time who I really was and what my importance was. That moment changed everything for me. Nothing on the outside changed, but everything on the inside did. I was part of His plan, His offering. And I hold a place within His Heart.</i> [Personal communication]</p>
<p>The world in which we live today tells us that our sense of worth is based upon what is seen or accomplished. We are measured by possessions and wealth, physical appearance and dress styles, social status and achievements. Too many of us strive to gain acceptance using these standards, trying to enhance the perception of our worth by those who are part of our lives as well as those who view us from afar. If we are not careful, we can let others determine and establish our standards and feelings of self-worth. We can become someone elses image of success rather than our own.</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee often quoted Harry Emerson Fosdicks description of a prayer of an old Edinburgh weaver: "O God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself" (Harry Emerson Fosdick, <i>Twelve Tests of Character</i> [New York: Association Press, 1941], 35; see Harold B. Lee, "Understanding Who We Are Brings Self-Respect," <i>Ensign,</i> January 1974, 4). In other words, the weaver prayed that he would value himself for what he was rather than for the opinions held by others. William Shakespeare also said:</p>
<p><i>This above all: to thine own self be true,</i></p>
<p><i>And it must follow, as the night the day,</i></p>
<p><i>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</i></p>
<p>[<i>Hamlet,</i> act 1, scene 3, lines 7880]</p>
<p>As university students you are dealing with the worldly requirements for success every day. Therefore, if you do not constantly remind yourselves of what is of true value and worth, you can lose perspective and insight as you forge ahead into the future. Sister Patricia Holland, speaking in a Brigham Young University devotional, stated:</p>
<p><i>We are becoming so concerned about having perfect figures, or straight As, or professional status . . . that we are being torn from our true selves. We often worry so much about pleasing and performing for others that we lose our own uniqueness, that full and relaxed acceptance of ourselves as a person of worth and individuality.</i> [Patricia T. Holland, "The Souls Center" (13 January 1987), <i>BYU 198687 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1987), 84]</p>
<p>My dear friends, I worry that we often forget that each one of us is inherently of great worth because we are children of God. It is easy to forget if we listen to the voices of the worlds values that surround us. Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it best: "Some among us mistakenly see the size and response of their audiences as the sole verification of their worth" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Irony: The Crust on the Bread of Adversity," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1989, 63).</p>
<p>Often these audiences would lead us to have a false sense of worth. This is evident today in the media messages as well as in the examples of many around us who live in and seek notoriety. The values of virtue, chastity, modesty, integrity, faith, love, and respect, among many others, are not perceived as worthwhile by so many today. The world would judge us to be of more worth by what we have than by what is in our hearts. It would have us reject these God-given values in favor of others that could lead us away from righteousness and positive feelings of self-worth.</p>
<p>The Lord has warned us in the scriptures that we are seeking the things of the world rather than seeking Him when we place the greatest value on riches and the praises of men. We are told that many are not chosen by the Lord "because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and [they] aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;C 121:35).</p>
<p>It is invaluable to each one of us that we always know and never forget that the measure of our worth is in our divine heritage. The gospel teaches us that our true worth is based upon its teachings and principles. We do not need the world to tell us whether we are successful and worthwhile or not.</p>
<p>The Lord does desire for us to be successful in our righteous endeavors - whether temporal or spiritual. There are many things of the world that are pleasing in His sight - such as gaining knowledge and wisdom as you study here - but one must never forget that the source of all these things is the Lord, and thus we should show Him gratitude. Showing gratitude to the Lord helps us better see our worth in His sight.</p>
<p>We strengthen our sense of worth by being dignified in the lives we lead and by following the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ. As we rely upon our Savior for guidance and His deep love for us in all we do, our feelings of personal worth will be expressed in the lives we lead, and we then bless others by our example and service.</p>
<p>Our eternal worth is given to us by God. We do not have to let it be determined by others - only by God and ourselves. We can lose sight of our self-worth if we do not keep the commandments and consequently disregard the divinity within us. The focus of the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ, is each one of us, as expressed in the book of Moses: "For behold, this is my work and my glory - to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me recite to you from the third verse of "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" that reminded my friend of her true self-worth - as it should remind all of us:</p>
<p><i>Oh, love effulgent, love divine!</i></p>
<p><i>What debt of gratitude is mine,</i></p>
<p><i>That in his offring I have part</i></p>
<p><i>And hold a place within his heart.</i></p>
<p>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 187]</p>
<p>It is my prayer that each of us may know of our worth to those who truly love us, especially our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is truly an honor and a privilege to be here with you today. When I was invited to speak at the devotional, I decided to ask my children what they felt was most important for BYU students to know. My eleven-year-old son, Nathan, said to tell you to not vote for a particular presidential candidate, who shall remain unnamed. My only daughter, Hannah, age eight, has three brothers. She felt that the most important thing to say should be directed at all the men and boys here in the audience in regard to their bathroom hygiene. Hannah and Nathan both offered some pretty sound advice, but I was particularly touched by the response from my five-year-old, Aidan. He said it was important to know that "God is special - and you are special."
I pondered Aidans words for some time. How can we know that we are special? More important, how can we know who we truly are?
Today I would like to talk about your royal identity.
When Elaine S. Dalton was the Young Women general president, she said:
Like the kings son, each of you has inherited a royal birthright. Each of you has a divine heritage. "You are literally the royal daughters of our Father in Heaven." Each of you was born to be a queen.1
What does it mean to be truly royal and what are the eternal implications of being royal? I study the effect of media on children and families. I just finished a study on the effect of the superhero and princess culture on children. If you have ever been around a preschool child, you know that both superheroes and princesses are very popular with this age group. In fact, many children this age say that they would like to be a superhero or a princess when they grow up.
I have been thinking quite a lot about superheroes and princesses over the past few years, and I would like to structure my talk with these two groups in mind. I will mainly be directing my comments on superheroes to the men in the room and my comments on princesses to the women. However, there are many overlaps in both categories, and I hope you can find things that apply to you in both sections.
Superheroes
I would first like to talk about the fantasy and reality of superheroes. Some of the most popular movies of all time have featured superheroes. Why are superheroes so popular today? Superheroes are pretty cool. We would like to imagine ourselves being able to fly faster than a speeding bullet, see through buildings, or be almost invincible. But there are definitely some fantasies and fallacies that are portrayed by superheroes in popular media.
Hypermasculinization
Because of your royal identity, you will one day have more power than the most powerful superhero. You have the potential to become limitless. As cool as superheroes are, they are</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Today is July 14. For most it is just another hot summer day, but for those with French connections it is La Fete Nationale, the day that France celebrates its independence. Every July 14 I am reminded of my missionary service in France and Belgium years ago. One July 14 my missionary companions and I watched from the port of Calais as fireworks burst over the English Channel in beautiful celebration of French freedom. This was a wonderful time for me - the last summer months of my mission among a people I had come to love and with whom I had labored to build faith and trust in God. Their faith had been terribly challenged by the ravages of war and other events, but some received the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and have been greatly blessed by its teachings.
Faith in God our Father and His Son Jesus Christ is a powerful force that moves souls and nations to look to the heavens for understanding of the purpose of life on earth. For me, some of the most inspiring verses of scripture are those that enumerate the exploits of the faithful, as in Hebrews 11 of the New Testament and Ether 12 of the Book of Mormon.
In Ether, Moroni told us that
faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.1
He then reminded us of the immovable faith of Alma and Amulek, Ammon and his brethren, Helamans sons Nephi and Lehi, and the brother of Jared.
In Hebrews 11, the apostle Paul wrote of the faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Sara. Of Abraham and Sara, Paul stated:
 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.2
Paul continued:
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.3
Then, referring to all these noble souls, Paul made a statement that captures our attention:
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.4
What was Paul teaching us in this passage? Was he saying that these great ones understood that this earth was not their home but rather a stopover on their way through the eternities?
This is one of the compelling questions of mankind. Are we truly strangers and pilgrims on the earth and is there more to our existence than meets the eye? Here we live on this small but beautiful blue planet. We each make ou</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I tell people I am a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics and English Language, I am often asked, "How many languages do you speak?" Or they may react and say, "Oh, Id better watch my grammar." While it is true that linguists study language, they study it in many different ways, not just by learning languages or by watching for grammar mistakes. I would like to give you a taste of what some of the linguists in our department and college do.
A few of my colleagues study and describe lesser-known languages - some that are spoken in North America, such as the Ute and Salish languages, along with other languages spoken around the world, such as Quichua, Xinkan, and Marshallese. Other colleagues study older forms of language, such as Old, Middle, and Early Modern English, with some examining how language has changed over time. Others investigate the language rules we are taught and which rules are useful to us today. One colleague studies how ambiguity in language - that is, how words or sentences can have more than one meaning - is applied in advertising. Others study how the pronunciation, words, and grammar of a language vary from one region or group to another. Another colleague has dedicated many years to researching the language in the Book of Mormon and constructing its original text. Some use technology to solve difficult and complex language problems. Others use databases containing millions of words to find language patterns, while others look for words and language patterns used by specific writers. Another group focuses on how languages are learned, particularly second languages, with some investigating the best ways to accurately measure proficiency in a language.
This research has been applied to a number of real-world problems by supporting language-preservation projects, creating language-frequency dictionaries and academic vocabulary lists, helping missionaries learn languages and assessing their progress, and extracting genealogical facts from texts in a fraction of the time it used to take.
These are just a few examples, but as you can see, there is much diversity in what my colleagues study; however, one thing they have in common is that they are passionate about and engaged in their research and teaching. While they have different stories of how they were led to study linguistics, they all have dedicated much of their time and effort to making their unique contributions to our field.
You do not have to be a linguist to be interested in language. You may have noticed differences in your own language or in others language when you came here to BYU or as you have traveled to different places. Some of you may have taken surveys available online that sometimes quite accurately pinpoint the area of the country you are from. These surveys include questions about how you pronounce different words. How do you pronounce these words: mountain, crayon, caramel? Do you p</span>
