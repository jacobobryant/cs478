  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="President Samuelson, honored guests, parents, family members, graduates, my dear brothers and sisters - Sister Uchtdorf and I extend our congratulations, commendation, and deep love to all of you whom we honor on this happy day. Even nature seems to be honoring you with the beauties of springtime as we mark the culmination of many years of hard work and study.

It is a great privilege for us to be with you today. And we are pleased to be with Elder and Sister Nelson, who are wonderful friends and true servants of the Lord.

I love this university. During my years as an airline captain, I would sometimes cross this beautiful part of Utah on flights from Frankfurt, Germany, to Los Angeles. When I did, I would often announce to the passengers that if they looked out their windows they would have the privilege of seeing the world-famous Brigham Young University below. Some captains might reserve such an announcement for sites like the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower, but to me Brigham Young University has always had a special place in my heart.

My wife and I did not have the privilege of attending BYU as students. However, our daughter received her bachelors and masters degrees here - and, by the way, she graduated summa cum laude. I assume that there are enough proud parents here today who can easily recognize one of their own. Let me share with you briefly why the memory of our daughters BYU experience is so tender to us.

Only a few months before receiving her degree, our daughter gave birth to twin boys who arrived six weeks early. Talk about student efficiency! When we observed how she and her husband found time to raise these two little babies while at the same time finishing their schooling, we were convinced that there is a special spirit at BYU. In this atmosphere not only does knowledge grow and multiply, so does the population!

My wife and I came all the way from Germany to attend our daughters commencement exercises. We sat way up there in the high bleachers with the two little babies in a double stroller, watching the students receive their diplomas. Little did we know that 19 years later we would be here once again, attending another commencement - this time with slightly better seats - representing the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

By the way, our handsome twin grandsons, who were born at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, are now six feet tall and serving missions for the Lord in Asia. Isnt it wonderful how life brings change, challenges, and blessings into our lives?

Today is a significant day of change for all of you. It is a day of closing and opening doors. It is a day of gratitude and rejoicing, a day of acknowledgment of our many debts to God, family, and friends. It is a day of radiant horizons and great expectations, and perhaps a day of a few fears as well.

My wife, Harriet, and I are honored to share this moment with you.

On a personal note, I am both humbled and grateful to receive this honorary degree. I thank you all for this. It will link my family even closer to this wonderful institution.

Happily, the honor I receive today comes without the necessity of taking final exams or, even worse, facing a panel of skeptical professors bent on uncovering vacuums of academic ignorance. So for that I am truly grateful. Nevertheless, I assure you that my family will treasure this honor as we treasure the memories of this beautiful day.

May I add that Harriet, who is with me here today, is the love of my life, and she actually deserves the highest honor within any authority to grant for being my wife and the sunshine of my life for 46 years.

When I asked our children what I should talk about at a commencement service, they quickly responded, "Keep it short, and dont worry about the topic. Everyone will be thinking about other things anyway."

That is excellent advice. However, there are three things I would like to leave with you - three things that may help you as you embark upon this new era of your lives. First, use time wisely. Second, continue to learn. Third, seek the Spirit always.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First: Use Time Wisely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A wise man once distinguished between "the noble art of getting things done" and "a nobler art of leaving things undone." True "wisdom in life," he taught, consists of "the elimination of non-essentials" (Lin Yutang, &lt;i&gt;The Importance of Living&lt;/i&gt; [New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1937], 162, 10). May I suggest that you periodically evaluate how you are doing in this area? What are the nonessential things that clutter your days and steal your time? What are the habits you may have developed that do not serve a useful purpose? What are the unfinished or unstarted things that could add vigor, meaning, and joy to your life?

Sometimes we make the mistake of neglecting the essentials of life. The Savior had harsh words for the scribes and Pharisees of His day: "Woe unto you," He told them, "for [you] have omitted the weightier matters of the law, [justice], mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done" (Matthew 23:23).

Although the Saviors words were directed to a specific audience thousands of years ago, they apply to us as well today.

In modern revelation, the Lord has commanded, "Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known" (D&amp;amp;C 60:13). It is quite common to hear people and friends of ours say, "Where has the time gone?" or "If I only had more time."

In reality, time is perhaps the only commodity of life that is divided equally among every person in the world. Think about it - we all have 24 hours in a day. Though some people have more demands on their time than others, we all have an equal opportunity to use those 24 hours wisely.

I learned how remarkably fair time is while performing long-range flights around the world. For example, we departed Frankfurt at 10:00 a.m. local time and, after an 11-hour flight in a B747, arrived in San Francisco at 12:00 noon California time, apparently only two hours later. That was wonderful - we had gained nine hours! Of course, you all know, on the next day, on our way back to Frankfurt, we lost the nine hours again.

Someone has said, "Time cannot be expanded, accumulated, mortgaged, hastened, or retarded" (anonymous, in John Cook, comp., &lt;i&gt;The Book of Positive Quotations,&lt;/i&gt; 2nd ed. [Minneapolis, Minnesota: 2007], 274).

And it is ever renewing. Even though we may have wasted time yesterday, there is hope. There is a full day waiting for us today and tomorrow. However, if we continue to take our allotted time for granted, we may find ourselves like Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it: "Either we use time wisely or it uses us; either we manage tasks effectively, or we are pushed about and prodded by them" (&lt;i&gt;The Smallest Part&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 46).

So how can we use our time wisely? In a world of so many things to do, how can we be sure that we are doing the best things? Elder Maxwell continued: "Since our impact must be selective [we must] do some goal-setting in terms of the outcomes we wish to achieve. Such goal-setting neednt be a hassling, hustling experience but rather a calm, periodic reasoned assessment of what we cherish enough to choose to do with our time" (&lt;i&gt;The Smallest Part,&lt;/i&gt; 46).

In qualifying for the degrees from this wonderful and grand institution today, you have shown the ability to determine what is most important, to set goals to achieve it, and to then use your time to accomplish these goals. I urge you to continue to set and work toward temporal and spiritual goals. These may include goals to give of your talents, of your time, and of your means to the weightier matters in life. Such goals will guide your decisions about how best to use your time.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second: Continue to Learn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It has been said that a university "is a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see" (John Masefield, remarks on receiving an honorary degree from Englands University of Sheffield in 1946, excerpts in "Beautiful Places," Education, &lt;i&gt;Time,&lt;/i&gt; 17 February 1947, 80).

What an eloquent reminder of your BYU motto: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."

Isnt this also a description of life itself? Isnt this what the great plan of happiness, the plan of salvation, is all about? Isnt this the purpose of our existence? My dear young friends, never stop learning. Never stop learning and never stop using what you learn to serve God and your fellowmen.

I encourage you to continue to pursue as much schooling as possible. In the competitive world of today, there is certainly a need to become an expert in your field of knowledge. However, there is also a great need to broaden and extend your horizons of learning and of interest.

Walk through life with open eyes and ears. The prophet Mormon as a child was described as one who was "quick to observe." He was told to remember the things that he had learned by observing the things around him (see Mormon 1:23).

Just think about it - even during the very difficult and challenging times in Kirtland, the Lord gave the Saints a charge to educate themselves:

&lt;i&gt;My grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in . . . all things that . . . are expedient for you to understand;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That ye may be prepared in all things.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 88:7880]

Expand and broaden your knowledge. My young friends, this is also your charge and your mission - for today and for the rest of your lives.

In my life I have learned that we can trust in God and in His promises. My familys circumstances during and after World War II made it almost impossible to get any advanced formal schooling. Most of my schooling had to be done after a full days work. Looking back, I can say the blessings of Church membership, the gospel, the unceasing desire to learn, and the willingness to work hard provided great opportunities even in most difficult times.

You and I cannot know everything. There is, however, One who does know it all, who understands all, who created all and everything - He is the Father of our spirits, our Father in Heaven. Because He is our Father, He has an intense interest in our education. He knows what we need to learn to fulfill our mission in life. Let us always be His students. Let us always open His textbooks. Let us sit at His feet and learn from Him. He knows every language and culture on this earth, and He will teach us in a way that we can understand. Let us always seek further light and knowledge from Him, the only real source of truth and light.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third: Seek the Spirit Always&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In piloting an airplane, you learn quickly that your flight path depends greatly on how you handle challenging external influences such as wind and weather. Even more important, however, are the decisions you make in response to those external influences. Your decisions, in fact, can counteract the external influences to ensure that you stay on course and reach your desired eternal, divine destination. In order to make those decisions correctly, it helps to know what your actual position is. Therefore, it is of vital importance to have a true and valid reference point like the polar star in the Northern Hemisphere or a reliable electronic platform wherever you are.

As you know, there are plenty of winds and storms in the world today that attempt to blow you off course. In order to continue the course you have begun here at Brigham Young University, you need a spiritual polar star in your life. You need a point of reference that has eternal consistency and reliability.

Today I bear witness to you, individually and collectively, that you do have the most stable and dependable reference platform for your spiritual and physical position available to you. It will help you to know at all times and in all places whether or not you are on the right path.

It is the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Always be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.

I firmly believe that a special spirit has rested upon this school from its very beginning. You have heard many times what Brigham Young told Karl G. Maeser as he commenced his work at Brigham Young Academy: "Remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser, &lt;i&gt;Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).

This wonderful and straightforward counsel by a prophet of God still applies to everything you do today and in the future. Keep this special BYU spirit in your lives. Do nothing without the Spirit of God. The presence of the Spirit of God will bring focus, certainty, and confidence into your life. And "by the power of the Holy Ghost [you] may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). The gift and the power of "the Holy Ghost . . . will show unto you all things what [you] should do" (2 Nephi 32:5).

What a wonderful promise for you as you move forward into your future.

You are a marvelous generation. You are blessed beyond measure. The world needs you and your goodness. Great opportunities await you. I love you; I admire you. Do not fear. God is with you; have faith. Use your time wisely, continue to learn, and always live worthy to have the Spirit with you.

I leave you my blessing and love, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>President Samuelson, honored guests, parents, family members, graduates, my dear brothers and sisters - Sister Uchtdorf and I extend our congratulations, commendation, and deep love to all of you whom we honor on this happy day. Even nature seems to be honoring you with the beauties of springtime as we mark the culmination of many years of hard work and study.</p>
<p>It is a great privilege for us to be with you today. And we are pleased to be with Elder and Sister Nelson, who are wonderful friends and true servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>I love this university. During my years as an airline captain, I would sometimes cross this beautiful part of Utah on flights from Frankfurt, Germany, to Los Angeles. When I did, I would often announce to the passengers that if they looked out their windows they would have the privilege of seeing the world-famous Brigham Young University below. Some captains might reserve such an announcement for sites like the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower, but to me Brigham Young University has always had a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>My wife and I did not have the privilege of attending BYU as students. However, our daughter received her bachelors and masters degrees here - and, by the way, she graduated summa cum laude. I assume that there are enough proud parents here today who can easily recognize one of their own. Let me share with you briefly why the memory of our daughters BYU experience is so tender to us.</p>
<p>Only a few months before receiving her degree, our daughter gave birth to twin boys who arrived six weeks early. Talk about student efficiency! When we observed how she and her husband found time to raise these two little babies while at the same time finishing their schooling, we were convinced that there is a special spirit at BYU. In this atmosphere not only does knowledge grow and multiply, so does the population!</p>
<p>My wife and I came all the way from Germany to attend our daughters commencement exercises. We sat way up there in the high bleachers with the two little babies in a double stroller, watching the students receive their diplomas. Little did we know that 19 years later we would be here once again, attending another commencement - this time with slightly better seats - representing the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>By the way, our handsome twin grandsons, who were born at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, are now six feet tall and serving missions for the Lord in Asia. Isnt it wonderful how life brings change, challenges, and blessings into our lives?</p>
<p>Today is a significant day of change for all of you. It is a day of closing and opening doors. It is a day of gratitude and rejoicing, a day of acknowledgment of our many debts to God, family, and friends. It is a day of radiant horizons and great expectations, and perhaps a day of a few fears as well.</p>
<p>My wife, Harriet, and I are honored to share this moment with you.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I am both humbled and grateful to receive this honorary degree. I thank you all for this. It will link my family even closer to this wonderful institution.</p>
<p>Happily, the honor I receive today comes without the necessity of taking final exams or, even worse, facing a panel of skeptical professors bent on uncovering vacuums of academic ignorance. So for that I am truly grateful. Nevertheless, I assure you that my family will treasure this honor as we treasure the memories of this beautiful day.</p>
<p>May I add that Harriet, who is with me here today, is the love of my life, and she actually deserves the highest honor within any authority to grant for being my wife and the sunshine of my life for 46 years.</p>
<p>When I asked our children what I should talk about at a commencement service, they quickly responded, "Keep it short, and dont worry about the topic. Everyone will be thinking about other things anyway."</p>
<p>That is excellent advice. However, there are three things I would like to leave with you - three things that may help you as you embark upon this new era of your lives. First, use time wisely. Second, continue to learn. Third, seek the Spirit always.</p>
<h2><b>First: Use Time Wisely</b></h2>
<p>A wise man once distinguished between "the noble art of getting things done" and "a nobler art of leaving things undone." True "wisdom in life," he taught, consists of "the elimination of non-essentials" (Lin Yutang, <i>The Importance of Living</i> [New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1937], 162, 10). May I suggest that you periodically evaluate how you are doing in this area? What are the nonessential things that clutter your days and steal your time? What are the habits you may have developed that do not serve a useful purpose? What are the unfinished or unstarted things that could add vigor, meaning, and joy to your life?</p>
<p>Sometimes we make the mistake of neglecting the essentials of life. The Savior had harsh words for the scribes and Pharisees of His day: "Woe unto you," He told them, "for [you] have omitted the weightier matters of the law, [justice], mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done" (Matthew 23:23).</p>
<p>Although the Saviors words were directed to a specific audience thousands of years ago, they apply to us as well today.</p>
<p>In modern revelation, the Lord has commanded, "Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known" (D&amp;C 60:13). It is quite common to hear people and friends of ours say, "Where has the time gone?" or "If I only had more time."</p>
<p>In reality, time is perhaps the only commodity of life that is divided equally among every person in the world. Think about it - we all have 24 hours in a day. Though some people have more demands on their time than others, we all have an equal opportunity to use those 24 hours wisely.</p>
<p>I learned how remarkably fair time is while performing long-range flights around the world. For example, we departed Frankfurt at 10:00 a.m. local time and, after an 11-hour flight in a B747, arrived in San Francisco at 12:00 noon California time, apparently only two hours later. That was wonderful - we had gained nine hours! Of course, you all know, on the next day, on our way back to Frankfurt, we lost the nine hours again.</p>
<p>Someone has said, "Time cannot be expanded, accumulated, mortgaged, hastened, or retarded" (anonymous, in John Cook, comp., <i>The Book of Positive Quotations,</i> 2nd ed. [Minneapolis, Minnesota: 2007], 274).</p>
<p>And it is ever renewing. Even though we may have wasted time yesterday, there is hope. There is a full day waiting for us today and tomorrow. However, if we continue to take our allotted time for granted, we may find ourselves like Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it: "Either we use time wisely or it uses us; either we manage tasks effectively, or we are pushed about and prodded by them" (<i>The Smallest Part</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 46).</p>
<p>So how can we use our time wisely? In a world of so many things to do, how can we be sure that we are doing the best things? Elder Maxwell continued: "Since our impact must be selective [we must] do some goal-setting in terms of the outcomes we wish to achieve. Such goal-setting neednt be a hassling, hustling experience but rather a calm, periodic reasoned assessment of what we cherish enough to choose to do with our time" (<i>The Smallest Part,</i> 46).</p>
<p>In qualifying for the degrees from this wonderful and grand institution today, you have shown the ability to determine what is most important, to set goals to achieve it, and to then use your time to accomplish these goals. I urge you to continue to set and work toward temporal and spiritual goals. These may include goals to give of your talents, of your time, and of your means to the weightier matters in life. Such goals will guide your decisions about how best to use your time.</p>
<h2><b>Second: Continue to Learn</b></h2>
<p>It has been said that a university "is a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see" (John Masefield, remarks on receiving an honorary degree from Englands University of Sheffield in 1946, excerpts in "Beautiful Places," Education, <i>Time,</i> 17 February 1947, 80).</p>
<p>What an eloquent reminder of your BYU motto: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."</p>
<p>Isnt this also a description of life itself? Isnt this what the great plan of happiness, the plan of salvation, is all about? Isnt this the purpose of our existence? My dear young friends, never stop learning. Never stop learning and never stop using what you learn to serve God and your fellowmen.</p>
<p>I encourage you to continue to pursue as much schooling as possible. In the competitive world of today, there is certainly a need to become an expert in your field of knowledge. However, there is also a great need to broaden and extend your horizons of learning and of interest.</p>
<p>Walk through life with open eyes and ears. The prophet Mormon as a child was described as one who was "quick to observe." He was told to remember the things that he had learned by observing the things around him (see Mormon 1:23).</p>
<p>Just think about it - even during the very difficult and challenging times in Kirtland, the Lord gave the Saints a charge to educate themselves:</p>
<p><i>My grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in . . . all things that . . . are expedient for you to understand;</i></p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, . . .</i></p>
<p><i>That ye may be prepared in all things.</i> [D&amp;C 88:7880]</p>
<p>Expand and broaden your knowledge. My young friends, this is also your charge and your mission - for today and for the rest of your lives.</p>
<p>In my life I have learned that we can trust in God and in His promises. My familys circumstances during and after World War II made it almost impossible to get any advanced formal schooling. Most of my schooling had to be done after a full days work. Looking back, I can say the blessings of Church membership, the gospel, the unceasing desire to learn, and the willingness to work hard provided great opportunities even in most difficult times.</p>
<p>You and I cannot know everything. There is, however, One who does know it all, who understands all, who created all and everything - He is the Father of our spirits, our Father in Heaven. Because He is our Father, He has an intense interest in our education. He knows what we need to learn to fulfill our mission in life. Let us always be His students. Let us always open His textbooks. Let us sit at His feet and learn from Him. He knows every language and culture on this earth, and He will teach us in a way that we can understand. Let us always seek further light and knowledge from Him, the only real source of truth and light.</p>
<h2><b>Third: Seek the Spirit Always</b></h2>
<p>In piloting an airplane, you learn quickly that your flight path depends greatly on how you handle challenging external influences such as wind and weather. Even more important, however, are the decisions you make in response to those external influences. Your decisions, in fact, can counteract the external influences to ensure that you stay on course and reach your desired eternal, divine destination. In order to make those decisions correctly, it helps to know what your actual position is. Therefore, it is of vital importance to have a true and valid reference point like the polar star in the Northern Hemisphere or a reliable electronic platform wherever you are.</p>
<p>As you know, there are plenty of winds and storms in the world today that attempt to blow you off course. In order to continue the course you have begun here at Brigham Young University, you need a spiritual polar star in your life. You need a point of reference that has eternal consistency and reliability.</p>
<p>Today I bear witness to you, individually and collectively, that you do have the most stable and dependable reference platform for your spiritual and physical position available to you. It will help you to know at all times and in all places whether or not you are on the right path.</p>
<p>It is the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Always be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that a special spirit has rested upon this school from its very beginning. You have heard many times what Brigham Young told Karl G. Maeser as he commenced his work at Brigham Young Academy: "Remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser, <i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).</p>
<p>This wonderful and straightforward counsel by a prophet of God still applies to everything you do today and in the future. Keep this special BYU spirit in your lives. Do nothing without the Spirit of God. The presence of the Spirit of God will bring focus, certainty, and confidence into your life. And "by the power of the Holy Ghost [you] may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). The gift and the power of "the Holy Ghost . . . will show unto you all things what [you] should do" (2 Nephi 32:5).</p>
<p>What a wonderful promise for you as you move forward into your future.</p>
<p>You are a marvelous generation. You are blessed beyond measure. The world needs you and your goodness. Great opportunities await you. I love you; I admire you. Do not fear. God is with you; have faith. Use your time wisely, continue to learn, and always live worthy to have the Spirit with you.</p>
<p>I leave you my blessing and love, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Internationally, BYU is known as "the language university." The 2017 edition of the pamphlet Y Facts reported that approximately 65 percent of BYU students speak more than one language.
Let me do a quick survey to see if those assembled here today are representative of BYU students in general. If you know more than one language, please raise your hand. [The majority of the audience raised their hand.]
I hope you realize how extraordinary it is that you have been given the gift of being able to communicate in more than one language. Think about it: language is the most complex of all human behaviors, and most of you can communicate in more than one language.
The Complexity of Language
Since we can all read English, I would like to demonstrate the complexity of language by giving you a simple English test. How would you read "St. Paul St." aloud?
You probably said, "Saint Paul Street." And your response to this simple task was likely not only correct but automatic. But can you explain to another person the rule for determining what the abbreviation "St." stands for? Perhaps you would say that "St." before a noun is an abbreviation for "saint," and "St." after a noun is an abbreviation for "street."
Now test your rule on the following street sign, which I saw near Disneyland in California: "St. College St."
Oops, there is no saint named College! However, there is a state college, so we will have to refine our rule for pronouncing the abbreviation "St."
Yes, even simple language is complex. Language is so complex that we are often hard pressed to explain how it operates. Yet we are generally unaware of how complex language is. In some ways language is like the air we breathe: we dont pay attention to it - unless there is something wrong with it.
Because people dont pay attention to language unless there is something wrong with it, you should not take compliments about your language skills too seriously. The fact that someone complimented you on your language is an indication that they noticed it - and that happens when there is something wrong with it.
Early in my mission in Austria, I was quite confident of my German language ability. In fact, several members had told me how well I spoke German. Then one Sunday after I said a prayer in sacrament meeting, I overheard some members commenting on my language skills.
One sister offered the critique, "War das nicht lieb? Genau wie ein kleines Kind!" Which means, "Wasnt that sweet? Just like a little child!"
The sister who made the comment was too kind to ever provide that honest feedback to me personally, so I was grateful that I had overheard the comment she had made to others. Her candid assessment let me know that I needed to improve my language skills.
Another mission experience taught me how complicated it is to translat</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You may wonder, as we gather to recognize and celebrate the end of your university career, why we hold a ceremony that we call a commencement. A commencement is, after all, a beginning, not an end. Some may conclude that this apparent misnomer occurs because university administrators, who organize and name such events, are often so confused that they are never sure whether they are coming or going or beginning or ending. That may be true. However, there are other explanations for this seeming contradiction.
We celebrate the final act of your university education with a commencement ceremony in part to impress upon you the need for perspective. Whether something is a beginning or an ending depends, in large measure, on the perspective from which things are viewed. A newly married couple - reflecting on the hectic events of the wedding day and all the details and planning that led up to it after a long engagement - was heard to say, "Now that we are married, we are finally at the end of all our troubles."
A wiser, more experienced couple standing nearby responded, "That is true, but the question is, at which end?" Perspective does matter.
While you may have taken your final final exam, while you may never again pull an overnighter to complete a research paper, and while you may no longer need to worry about what grade you receive on an assignment, that does not mean that your education is complete. Calling this ceremony a commencement hopefully serves to remind you that while you are graduating from this university, you have not concluded the learning phase of your life; instead, you are at the other end of that process, the beginning - the commencement.
Brigham Young, the founder of this university, put it this way:
We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it: never, never.1
Thus one of the aims of a BYU education is to prepare our students for "lifelong learning."2 And, in that regard, it is important to note that we believe in very long lives. As Brother Brigham explained:
We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information.3
I have met numerous lifelong learners in my life - people who, no matter how much they know or how far along they are in their careers or lives, seem compelled to learn more. One such was Domingo Catricura. Domingo was a student in an Indian law class I team taught at the University of Chile Law School more than twenty years ago. Domingo was in his fifties at the time and was one of about twenty-five non-law students who attended the class along with thirty law students. The non-law students were invited to attend the course because they were leaders in various Mapuche communities - the Mapuches being the largest indigenous group in Chile. They we</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I was born in Mountain View, California, the second of (eventually) eleven children. We settled in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the east side of San Jose, not far from the rolling foothills that are crowned by the imposing Mount Hamilton, home to the Lick Observatory, "the first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory in the world."1 The weather was usually pleasant, even during the warm, sunny days of summer. As spring yielded to summer, the foothills would turn from a verdant green to a cozy, warm brown. But even on hot days, a cool breeze would flow off the bay every afternoon just as temperatures were peaking for the day.
Our subdivision consisted of a single principal street with four cul-de-sacs branching off toward the east. To the south was a walnut orchard that, in a childs mind, seemed dark and foreboding - the stuff of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. To the east was a large strawberry field. One day Mom sent my older brother, Jim, and me out to pick strawberries. I remember doing a lot of picking and eating; I dont remember bringing much home in the bowl she gave us.
Shortly thereafter, bulldozers and earthmovers took over as Interstate 680 came to our neighborhood. The walnut orchard also gave way to construction. "Silicon Valley" had to be built, and it seemed we were in the middle of it.
When I was fourteen years old, my father decided to purchase a microcomputer kit. This seemed like a sensible activity for a systems analyst in Silicon Valley. He chose the Heathkit H-89, and it was as amazing in 1979 as an iPad is today! I am sorry to get a little nerdy here, but I need to paint the picture properly. The H-89 was an all-in-one model with a keyboard and a twelve-inch display built right in. Its brain was an eight-bit Zilog brand Z80 CPU2 that ran at more than two megahertz (that is more than two million clock cycles per second). The kit came standard with 16K of RAM,3 but since Dad bought three expansion packs over time, we eventually had an entire 56K of RAM in which to lose ourselves. (In contrast, a typical smartphone today has billions of bytes of RAM and executes billions of clock cycles each second.)
Dad let us older boys help build the thing, but, as I recall, I was the most zealous deputy in the bunch. We had to bolt and solder all sorts of parts together, and soon enough there was this box - a true marvel of engineering and a testament to not only mankinds creativity but also our ability to follow complex instructions and manipulate tiny parts. There it was, sitting on our kitchen table with its fan purring, enthusiastically waiting for that next instruction to come in from its mass storage device, a cassette tape recorder. (Yes, it took another upgrade before we could use modern, high-capacity floppy disk technology.4)
The computer was built, so what next? I had to learn how to program it. I knew how it was as</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you - graduates, parents, and other supporters - thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbruck, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they dont. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests - like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>
