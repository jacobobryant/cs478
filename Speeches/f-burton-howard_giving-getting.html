  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Throughout our years at the university, and for a considerable time thereafter, my wife and I lived in a congested area near downtown Salt Lake City. After graduating from law school, I was fortunate in obtaining a job at the state capitol. Church callings and the proximity of our home to my office caused us to be in no hurry to leave our small apartment, even had our financial situation allowed us to. One of the economies which my wife allowed me to practice was walking to work. The distance was not too great and the Capitol Hill climb kept me fit.

One brilliant, warm day, I had come home for lunch. As I was returning to work I noticed a small boy sitting on the curb at the foot of the hill. I knew him by sight as a neighbor who lived in a large apartment house next door to us. His parents were divorced. His mother worked and often left him alone in the afternoon to look after himself. As I was in no hurry to begin my ascent, I stopped to talk with him for a moment.

“What are you doing?” I said.

“Waiting for my brother.”

“Where is he?” I asked as I contemplated the hot climb up the hill. His answer brought me immediately to attention.

“He’s in school.”

“Don’t you know that school isn’t out until 3:30?” I gently asked.

He shuffled his toe in the dirt of the street and looked at me with what I am now positive was condescension. “Sure,” he said, “but I don’t want to miss him.”

“Maybe the kid had a point,” I thought as I climbed the hill. And I have pondered his statement many times since that day.

Of course he did. Whatever his reason for wanting his brother—whether for love or loneliness or just to deliver a family message—it was of sufficient importance for him to wait on the curb at the side of a hot street all afternoon. He was not going to miss his brother, whatever the discomfort or whatever the cost. He had nothing more important to do.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giving and Getting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It is difficult to sit in the sun on a street corner when all the world is hell-bent on seeking shade. But, as with many other things, it is where you sit that counts—or where you stand—or what you stand for. And with some things there is nothing more important to do than pay the price; even though it entails inconvenience or sacrifice.

Before getting much older, my young friend would find no shortage of those who would tell him he paid too much to see his brother that hot afternoon.

“Don’t be dumb,” they would say.

“You could have watched television until just before school let out.”

Or they would say, “You should have stayed in the shade at home, instead of sitting on that dusty old curb.”

“Be smart,” they would say. “Don’t give more than you have to, just to see your brother.”

But did he give too much? Was he just a naïve little boy? Can we learn something from him? To simplify the subject, let me suggest that the real question on that street corner was how much to give in exchange for his brother’s company that hot afternoon.

This question perhaps can be best understood by subdividing it into two:

How much was he &lt;i&gt;required&lt;/i&gt; to give and how much could he give? It is a paradox that, when we speak of how much &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be given, we usually speak of getting. Only when we talk in terms of how much &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be given, are we really speaking of giving.

Most of us were born with an egotistical streak. It is common in children. As we grow up we try to become less self-seeking and more interested in the welfare of others. But many labor mightily to obtain or retain as much as they can while giving up as little as possible in every giving and getting transaction. I suppose everyone has played Monopoly with such a person. It is sobering to realize that life is a never-ending series of such transactions, dozens each day, and that the sum total of all these seemingly insignificant things constitutes our mortal probation.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Time of Waiting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I remember what it is like to attend a university. I don’t think I would voluntarily trade places with any of you, even if I could be young again. I remember the pain. I remember staying up all night to prepare for an examination. I vividly recall homework and homesickness, grades and graduation. I remember part-time jobs that never paid enough and roommates that borrowed things. I remember worrying about what to do and what to be (which, by the way, I believe are the same thing). I remember the relief when the books closed for the last time, and the diplomas were finally awarded. I remember thinking that at last I could get on with the real business of living.

The university was for me as it is for you, a time of waiting—and therein lies a danger. Everything a student does seems pointed to the future. Students are transients. Their hearts are often elsewhere. Summer jobs, lectures, credits—all of these promise a time when prosperity and peace will finally reign—when they can come home after work to a real home and do what they want; when one well-paying job will allow enjoyment of the important things like marriage or family or church service.

C. S. Lewis once said,

&lt;i&gt;Nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to the present; fear, avarice, lust and ambition look ahead. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;The Screwtape Letters&lt;/i&gt; (Time Incorporated, 1963), p. 49]

The prophet Jacob put it another way. He spoke of the necessity of understanding “things as they really are, and of things as they really will be.” He described the Jews as searching for things that they could not understand and being blinded because of “looking beyond the mark” (Jacob 4:13–14).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Real Test Is Today, Not Tomorrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
So it is that college students, and others as well, often look beyond the mark. They live in inexpensive apartments. They economize on their grocery bills. They walk to school or work. They take out loans they do not know how to repay. They live on hand-me-downs and food baskets from their parents. They look for bargains. They accept student rates at theaters and take vacations that don’t cost much. They settle for less in order to have more some day. Because much of what they live for lies in the future, young people sometimes forget that the real test is never tomorrow but it is always today.

Students are usually in a hurry to get on with life. Some remind me of a missionary I had in the mission field. He once penned an unforgettable line: “President,” he wrote, “do you know any quick way to memorize the discussions? If you do, send it to me right away.”

Because students are anxious to begin living, they tend to look for shortcuts. They sometimes merely endure difficult courses. They have been known to avoid hard teachers and to read long books in outline form. Students have often been known to cram for examinations, and burn the midnight oil. All of this is done in expectation of better things to come. Sadly, those who burn the candle at both ends are usually more concerned with getting than with giving.

Because there is never enough time, students sometimes develop an attitude which will severely interfere with their spiritual progress, not only as students but throughout their lives as well. They try to get by. The question becomes “How much must I give to get the grade?” not “How can I master the subject?” or “How can I get out of school?” not “What can I learn here?”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Such Things as a Free Lunch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In another related area, students are besieged with offers for free things—free karate lessons, free records and tapes, incredible returns on investments. The bookstore is filled with books having titles such as &lt;i&gt;How to Make a Killing in Real Estate, How to Avoid Probate, How to Make a Million Dollars, How to Sell Anything to Anyone, Shortcuts to Effective Public Speaking, 10 Days to a Better Personality, Calculus Made Easy.&lt;/i&gt;

It is easy to forget Euclid’s warning that there is no royal road to geometry or the well-known comment that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Little by little, often imperceptibly, our minds become conditioned to getting the things we want with as little effort as possible. We guard our giving, that we may have more time for getting. Many seek grades without effort, athletic attainment without training, musical excellence without practice. They try to lose weight without dieting and want to be free without being responsible. Others become more concerned with finding the right person than they are with &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; the right person.

It is not that these things are illegal or immoral, but they do have one thing in common. They all represent, at least in part, an attempt to acquire something of real worth without paying adequate consideration for it. And it is a short leap from these attitudes to others which are more serious. As minds become conditioned to getting things without effort, or with as little effort as possible, it is easy to rationalize that it is a clever thing to secure advantage without paying the price.

For example, how many automobiles are not insured as required by law? How many own tapes or video cassettes which have been copied in violation of copyright laws? How many don’t tell the full truth when they buy or sell bicycles, stereos, used cars or other things? How many think that radar detectors should be standard equipment on every automobile? How many court unmerited popularity by telling off-color stories? How many seek artificial sensual stimulation as a substitute for righteous joy? How many of us are anxious to have success without sacrifice? It can’t be done, you know.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be More Concerned with Giving Than with Gain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In this regard, there is an interesting story in the scriptures. On one occasion, late in life, King David offended the Lord. He sinned greatly and asked the Lord to remove his iniquity, acknowledging that he had done a foolish thing. To punish David, the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel and 70,000 men died. David complained to the Lord and said, “I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these [meaning the people], what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house” (2 Samuel 24:17).

That same day the prophet Gad came to David and said that the Lord would remove the plague if David would build an altar on the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite and offer an acceptable sacrifice there. David was anxious to lift the Lord’s curse. He quickly went to Araunah’s place of business, and then the scripture details this most interesting account:

&lt;i&gt;And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;All these things did Araunah . . . &lt;/i&gt;[offer]&lt;i&gt; unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.&lt;/i&gt;

Here David could have made a fatal mistake. He could have been more concerned with gain than with giving. But he wisely said unto Araunah,

&lt;i&gt;Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: &lt;/i&gt;neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing. &lt;i&gt;So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver&lt;/i&gt; [which was no small sum in those days].

&lt;i&gt;And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Samuel 24:20–25; emphasis added]

Why was David concerned about personally paying for the offering the prophet commanded him to make? Was it because he knew there is always a cost when real sacrifice is made? Should it be of concern to us if we fail to pay honest measure for that which we receive? Can we hope to learn a language if we are unwilling to make an effort? Is it possible to be forgiven without honestly repenting? Should we seek a witness before the trial of our faith? I believe all of these attitudes which many of us have shared at one time or another may jeopardize our salvation. Let me tell you why.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Satan Offered Salvation without Risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The scriptures tell us that Satan once came before God in the premortal existence with a plan to redeem all mankind and not lose one soul. You all remember the story. In exchange for what he offered, the son of the morning wanted honor (&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; Moses 4:1) and the power of God (&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; D&amp;amp;C 29:36, Moses 4:3). Because we had free agency there, as we do now, Satan induced one third of all of the spirit children of God to turn away from the plan proposed by Jesus Christ and to fight for his proposal (&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; D&amp;amp;C 29:36, Abraham 3:28). When his scheme was rejected, Satan rebelled and sought to destroy the very agency he had to use to gain approval of his plan (&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; Moses 4:3).

But how did he manage to draw one third of us away from God? I believe that it was simply by saying that there were unnecessary hazards in Christ’s plan, and that the power of God was sufficient to save all men without effort and without the keeping of commandments. It was an attractive package. Many were deceived. In effect, they were offered salvation without risk. It wasn’t that our spirit brothers and sisters didn’t value free agency. They were undoubtedly taught about it and its importance. Probably they were committed to the concept, but because they were aware of the risks and were aware of their own weaknesses, they were unwilling to go to earth without a guaranteed round trip ticket. They valued the presence of God more than agency and lost both because they looked beyond the mark and could not see that it was impossible to have one without the other.

In a sense they wanted the mortal experience and a token probation. After punishment with a few stripes, they wanted to be returned again to that place they loved so much. But they were afraid of the real risk of mortality—of the discipline and the cost. They knew full well that there was death and evil inherent in the flesh (see 2 Nephi 2:29). They knew that many would find it difficult to walk by faith and would stumble and succumb to temptation (see Moses 5:7–8). They knew that without temptation they could not become agents unto themselves (see D&amp;amp;C 29:39).

That price was unacceptable to many who did not want to leave home. They began to cast about for an easier way and, when it was offered, they accepted it. I have learned that the easy way to anything is almost always suspect.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Is a Blessing to Earn What We Receive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
After Adam’s transgression, the Lord told him that the ground would be cursed for his sake (&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; Moses 4:23). It is interesting to me that one definition of the word &lt;i&gt;sake&lt;/i&gt; is benefit. Thus, cursed was the ground for Adam’s benefit. And by the sweat of his brow he was to earn his bread (&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; Moses 4:25). Work, then, was not to be a curse and earning things was to be a benefit.

This is still true today, notwithstanding the fact that much time and effort go into trying to beat the system. Work is still the ruling principle in the lives of the Latter-day Saints. We should not seek to acquire things without effort. Only that which is truly earned is ever really ours. It is a blessing to earn what we receive, and this applies to spiritual things as well.

I heard a sweet lady speak in church not long ago. She spoke of a difficult marriage and a husband who was unwilling to live the gospel. She spoke of abuse and emotional disorders. She spoke of trouble and debt. Real physical illness resulted from trying to hold her marriage together. My heart went out to her. Then she said, “But finally I asked my dear bishop what to do and he told me to get a divorce, so I did.”

She said, “dear.” She meant “poor.” Shame on a bishop who would tell a woman to get a divorce. The effect of doing that was to deprive the woman of the opportunity of paying the price for her own inspiration or revelation. Certainly she was entitled to it. But as with all other valuable things, there is a price attached. I do not know whether the bishop told her the right thing or not. But I do believe that there are no shortcuts to inspiration. The price is always praying and studying the matter in your mind. Often there is fasting and patient waiting. No earthly power can change all of that. I fear that the woman was trying to find the will of the Lord for her without paying the price. That simply cannot be done. Yet how many of us say to our bishops, “Tell me what to do”?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;“When You Find the Answer, Let Me Know”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
On one occasion I was with President Marion G. Romney. He spoke to a large gathering of young people. Afterwards, a returned missionary came up to shake his hand. As he did, he said, “President Romney, when I was a missionary I had a question that no one knew the answer to. Let me take advantage of your time for a moment and ask you.” He then asked a rather complicated question, the answer to which could have been found in the scriptures.

President Romney listened attentively for a few moments and then replied, “That is a very good question. When you find the answer, let me know, will you please?” As we left the hall he commented to me, obviously referring to the young man and his question, “My father taught me as a boy that when I wanted a drink I should go to where the spring flowed out of the ground and not downstream where the cattle had been muddying the water. He’ll be better off if he finds the answer for himself.”

But how easy it is to find someone else with the answers to our questions. How many want to know the mysteries of God without studying the scriptures? How many ask the Lord to do things which they should do for themselves? They forget there is no spiritual attainment without effort. The attitudes we sometimes develop in the world can be spiritually fatal if applied to such things as repentance or eternal marriage or keeping the commandments. Think of the consequences, for example, of asking, “Must I serve a mission?” compared to asking, “Can I serve a mission?”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several Reasons to Earn What We Get&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As I have thought about the subject, it seems that there are several reasons why the Lord wants us to earn what we get in this life.

First, if we get things without effort, we often fail to make the hard choices we were sent here to make. We may fail to exercise our agency and thereby be deprived of important blessings. We are then out of harmony with the Lord and lose the blessings and trials (for many trials are blessings) which he intended would be a part of our own particular probation. As an illustration, what would Cain have done to come up with an acceptable offering to the Lord, if he had not killed Abel? Could not introspection and prayer and an honest, humble sacrifice have made an eternal difference in his life?

Second, if we acquire things with little or no effort, we often develop an exaggerated view of our own ability and our own importance. If we think we are better than we really are, then we are in danger of not being sufficiently humble to be able to enter the Kingdom of God.

Third, when we get something for nothing, we often feel that others do the same. Then we become critical, feeling that patronage, nepotism, luck, influence, or favoritism have allowed them to acquire what they have. Jealousy and envy then easily enter our lives.

Fourth, when we get something for nothing, we often develop a delusion of being especially blessed by the Lord. This can discourage hard work on other projects and may bring great disappointment when similar slack efforts do not result in corresponding large rewards.

Fifth, when we get something for nothing, it is often at the expense of someone else’s loss. If the whole truth were known, offense might be taken. I do not want to be included among those about whom the Savior said, “Woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea” (Luke 17:1–2).

Last of all, things cheaply purchased are seldom appreciated. Attitudes which cause us to look for bargains in some areas of life will carry over (because as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he) into more important things. We may then come to seek testimony without study and spiritual power without cost, and the greatest blessings of life may be cheapened or lost altogether as a result.

There is an important lesson here for Latter-day Saints. Somehow, some way, sooner or later, whether we want it that way or not, there are some experiences that all men must have. There are some truths that all must learn. There is a relationship between what we give and what we get. Shortcuts are often hazardous to the important things, both in this life and the life to come. There are no spiritual shortcuts to anything. We must learn that peace of mind has its price and that there can be no exaltation without effort.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Satisfaction of Giving Lasts Longer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I spoke about a young boy sitting on a street corner. I said it often depends on where you sit or where you stand with reference to the important issues, whether you get a reward or not. You may be interested to know where I stand as a humble servant of the Lord with reference to getting and giving. I am deeply conscious of my own weaknesses in this area. Yet, as I have seen the dangers and struggled with personal self-interest, I have found that the satisfaction of giving lasts much longer than the sweetness of getting. Like Abraham, I have found “greater happiness and peace and rest for me” (Abraham 1:2) when I render honest sacrifice and pay fair and adequate consideration for what I get.

Therefore:

1. I have resolved never to ask the Church or anyone else to do for me what I should do for myself. Where possible, I prefer to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.

2. When I pray, I always try to pray “Thy will be done, not mine.” President Tanner once said that too many of us merely take a shopping list to the Lord when we pray. I try not to do that unless it is absolutely necessary.

3. As a lawyer, before being called as a General Authority, I never accepted a case which would cause me to bend the law or ignore the facts; or which would give my client a benefit he didn’t deserve. I still recoil from those who suggest such things and do not traffic with men and women who shade the truth for personal gain.

4. I am thankful that my eternal companion also believes in giving honest measure for what she gets. In fact, she gives more, and I appreciate that. It seems to me that a “something for nothing” attitude is inconsistent with eternal marriage.

5. I have never consciously misrepresented my income to the government, and have always paid taxes on that which I have earned. I have little sympathy with some vocal groups who look for ways to avoid this obligation. It seems to me that they want all of the benefits of democracy without paying for them.

6. Likewise, I have never misrepresented my income to my bishop. I have always tried to pay just a little bit more tithing than I owed. I avoid thinking in terms of net or gross income and believe that gifts or profits from sale of my property are included in my increase. I recognize that all that I have comes from the Lord. I would willingly give up a new sports car or boat or a vacation, just for the privilege of paying tithing. I have done this all of my life and I have no regrets.

7. I believe in the “second mile.” I have come to know that the first mile doesn’t count for much and the one freely given counts for everything.

8. I have learned to distrust praise and to seek honest humility, which I define to be a true and correct estimate of what I really am in the sight of God. No more and no less.

9. I never sign up for sweepstakes, prizes, giveaways, free offers or chances of a lifetime. As I wait in airports around the world, there are sometimes slot machines there to help passengers pass the time. I never put any money in them, even spare change. I am actually afraid I will win something.

10. I ask myself often, “What would Christ do?” and then try to do it. As the answer to that question comes, it almost always involves giving, not getting.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is No Exaltation without Effort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As children we all learned the stories of the “Goose That Laid the Golden Egg,” of “Jack and the Magic Beans,” of “The Three Wishes,” and “King Midas,” whose touch turned everything to gold. But it was Paul who said,

&lt;i&gt;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I become a man, I put away childish things. &lt;/i&gt;[1 Corinthians 13:11]

I suppose that most of us have dreamed of inheriting a million dollars, or making a killing in a business venture, or even just being free of the work-a-day world in order to do what we want. But it is unworthy of a Latter-day Saint to spend his time trying to achieve these or other things without effort. The real reason for our mortal probation is to confront challenges, not escape them. It is to learn to give, not to learn to get. In earth life, as in the university life, we cannot complain about not getting passing grades if we are unwilling to take the test. There are no shortcuts to the plan of salvation. There is no exaltation without effort. We have nothing more important to do than to fully, honestly, and completely obey the laws upon which blessings are predicated. Make no mistake about it, we will reap what we sow (see Galatians 6:7).

It has always interested me that the broad way seems pleasant enough at first, while the narrow strait way initially does not. It has nothing to commend it to the advertisers of the world. It is difficult to sell. It is a toll road. The tariff is work, discipline, service, and love for others. It is paying the price for everything we get, then giving it away. Once entered into, however, those who travel the straight road are never the same. What at first seemed unpleasant will turn out to be the sweetest and most desirable road of all. It is what we give ourselves to that brings meaning and purpose into our lives—not what we get or gain. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Throughout our years at the university, and for a considerable time thereafter, my wife and I lived in a congested area near downtown Salt Lake City. After graduating from law school, I was fortunate in obtaining a job at the state capitol. Church callings and the proximity of our home to my office caused us to be in no hurry to leave our small apartment, even had our financial situation allowed us to. One of the economies which my wife allowed me to practice was walking to work. The distance was not too great and the Capitol Hill climb kept me fit.</p>
<p>One brilliant, warm day, I had come home for lunch. As I was returning to work I noticed a small boy sitting on the curb at the foot of the hill. I knew him by sight as a neighbor who lived in a large apartment house next door to us. His parents were divorced. His mother worked and often left him alone in the afternoon to look after himself. As I was in no hurry to begin my ascent, I stopped to talk with him for a moment.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” I said.</p>
<p>“Waiting for my brother.”</p>
<p>“Where is he?” I asked as I contemplated the hot climb up the hill. His answer brought me immediately to attention.</p>
<p>“He’s in school.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know that school isn’t out until 3:30?” I gently asked.</p>
<p>He shuffled his toe in the dirt of the street and looked at me with what I am now positive was condescension. “Sure,” he said, “but I don’t want to miss him.”</p>
<p>“Maybe the kid had a point,” I thought as I climbed the hill. And I have pondered his statement many times since that day.</p>
<p>Of course he did. Whatever his reason for wanting his brother—whether for love or loneliness or just to deliver a family message—it was of sufficient importance for him to wait on the curb at the side of a hot street all afternoon. He was not going to miss his brother, whatever the discomfort or whatever the cost. He had nothing more important to do.</p>
<h2><b>Giving and Getting</b></h2>
<p>It is difficult to sit in the sun on a street corner when all the world is hell-bent on seeking shade. But, as with many other things, it is where you sit that counts—or where you stand—or what you stand for. And with some things there is nothing more important to do than pay the price; even though it entails inconvenience or sacrifice.</p>
<p>Before getting much older, my young friend would find no shortage of those who would tell him he paid too much to see his brother that hot afternoon.</p>
<p>“Don’t be dumb,” they would say.</p>
<p>“You could have watched television until just before school let out.”</p>
<p>Or they would say, “You should have stayed in the shade at home, instead of sitting on that dusty old curb.”</p>
<p>“Be smart,” they would say. “Don’t give more than you have to, just to see your brother.”</p>
<p>But did he give too much? Was he just a naïve little boy? Can we learn something from him? To simplify the subject, let me suggest that the real question on that street corner was how much to give in exchange for his brother’s company that hot afternoon.</p>
<p>This question perhaps can be best understood by subdividing it into two:</p>
<p>How much was he <i>required</i> to give and how much could he give? It is a paradox that, when we speak of how much <i>must</i> be given, we usually speak of getting. Only when we talk in terms of how much <i>can</i> be given, are we really speaking of giving.</p>
<p>Most of us were born with an egotistical streak. It is common in children. As we grow up we try to become less self-seeking and more interested in the welfare of others. But many labor mightily to obtain or retain as much as they can while giving up as little as possible in every giving and getting transaction. I suppose everyone has played Monopoly with such a person. It is sobering to realize that life is a never-ending series of such transactions, dozens each day, and that the sum total of all these seemingly insignificant things constitutes our mortal probation.</p>
<h2><b>A Time of Waiting</b></h2>
<p>I remember what it is like to attend a university. I don’t think I would voluntarily trade places with any of you, even if I could be young again. I remember the pain. I remember staying up all night to prepare for an examination. I vividly recall homework and homesickness, grades and graduation. I remember part-time jobs that never paid enough and roommates that borrowed things. I remember worrying about what to do and what to be (which, by the way, I believe are the same thing). I remember the relief when the books closed for the last time, and the diplomas were finally awarded. I remember thinking that at last I could get on with the real business of living.</p>
<p>The university was for me as it is for you, a time of waiting—and therein lies a danger. Everything a student does seems pointed to the future. Students are transients. Their hearts are often elsewhere. Summer jobs, lectures, credits—all of these promise a time when prosperity and peace will finally reign—when they can come home after work to a real home and do what they want; when one well-paying job will allow enjoyment of the important things like marriage or family or church service.</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis once said,</p>
<p><i>Nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to the present; fear, avarice, lust and ambition look ahead. </i>[<i>The Screwtape Letters</i> (Time Incorporated, 1963), p. 49]</p>
<p>The prophet Jacob put it another way. He spoke of the necessity of understanding “things as they really are, and of things as they really will be.” He described the Jews as searching for things that they could not understand and being blinded because of “looking beyond the mark” (Jacob 4:13–14).</p>
<h2><b>The Real Test Is Today, Not Tomorrow</b></h2>
<p>So it is that college students, and others as well, often look beyond the mark. They live in inexpensive apartments. They economize on their grocery bills. They walk to school or work. They take out loans they do not know how to repay. They live on hand-me-downs and food baskets from their parents. They look for bargains. They accept student rates at theaters and take vacations that don’t cost much. They settle for less in order to have more some day. Because much of what they live for lies in the future, young people sometimes forget that the real test is never tomorrow but it is always today.</p>
<p>Students are usually in a hurry to get on with life. Some remind me of a missionary I had in the mission field. He once penned an unforgettable line: “President,” he wrote, “do you know any quick way to memorize the discussions? If you do, send it to me right away.”</p>
<p>Because students are anxious to begin living, they tend to look for shortcuts. They sometimes merely endure difficult courses. They have been known to avoid hard teachers and to read long books in outline form. Students have often been known to cram for examinations, and burn the midnight oil. All of this is done in expectation of better things to come. Sadly, those who burn the candle at both ends are usually more concerned with getting than with giving.</p>
<p>Because there is never enough time, students sometimes develop an attitude which will severely interfere with their spiritual progress, not only as students but throughout their lives as well. They try to get by. The question becomes “How much must I give to get the grade?” not “How can I master the subject?” or “How can I get out of school?” not “What can I learn here?”</p>
<h2><b>No Such Things as a Free Lunch</b></h2>
<p>In another related area, students are besieged with offers for free things—free karate lessons, free records and tapes, incredible returns on investments. The bookstore is filled with books having titles such as <i>How to Make a Killing in Real Estate, How to Avoid Probate, How to Make a Million Dollars, How to Sell Anything to Anyone, Shortcuts to Effective Public Speaking, 10 Days to a Better Personality, Calculus Made Easy.</i></p>
<p>It is easy to forget Euclid’s warning that there is no royal road to geometry or the well-known comment that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Little by little, often imperceptibly, our minds become conditioned to getting the things we want with as little effort as possible. We guard our giving, that we may have more time for getting. Many seek grades without effort, athletic attainment without training, musical excellence without practice. They try to lose weight without dieting and want to be free without being responsible. Others become more concerned with finding the right person than they are with <i>being</i> the right person.</p>
<p>It is not that these things are illegal or immoral, but they do have one thing in common. They all represent, at least in part, an attempt to acquire something of real worth without paying adequate consideration for it. And it is a short leap from these attitudes to others which are more serious. As minds become conditioned to getting things without effort, or with as little effort as possible, it is easy to rationalize that it is a clever thing to secure advantage without paying the price.</p>
<p>For example, how many automobiles are not insured as required by law? How many own tapes or video cassettes which have been copied in violation of copyright laws? How many don’t tell the full truth when they buy or sell bicycles, stereos, used cars or other things? How many think that radar detectors should be standard equipment on every automobile? How many court unmerited popularity by telling off-color stories? How many seek artificial sensual stimulation as a substitute for righteous joy? How many of us are anxious to have success without sacrifice? It can’t be done, you know.</p>
<h2><b>Be More Concerned with Giving Than with Gain</b></h2>
<p>In this regard, there is an interesting story in the scriptures. On one occasion, late in life, King David offended the Lord. He sinned greatly and asked the Lord to remove his iniquity, acknowledging that he had done a foolish thing. To punish David, the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel and 70,000 men died. David complained to the Lord and said, “I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these [meaning the people], what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house” (2 Samuel 24:17).</p>
<p>That same day the prophet Gad came to David and said that the Lord would remove the plague if David would build an altar on the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite and offer an acceptable sacrifice there. David was anxious to lift the Lord’s curse. He quickly went to Araunah’s place of business, and then the scripture details this most interesting account:</p>
<p><i>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</i></p>
<p><i>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</i></p>
<p><i>All these things did Araunah . . . </i>[offer]<i> unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.</i></p>
<p>Here David could have made a fatal mistake. He could have been more concerned with gain than with giving. But he wisely said unto Araunah,</p>
<p><i>Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: </i>neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing. <i>So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver</i> [which was no small sum in those days].</p>
<p><i>And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. </i>[2 Samuel 24:20–25; emphasis added]</p>
<p>Why was David concerned about personally paying for the offering the prophet commanded him to make? Was it because he knew there is always a cost when real sacrifice is made? Should it be of concern to us if we fail to pay honest measure for that which we receive? Can we hope to learn a language if we are unwilling to make an effort? Is it possible to be forgiven without honestly repenting? Should we seek a witness before the trial of our faith? I believe all of these attitudes which many of us have shared at one time or another may jeopardize our salvation. Let me tell you why.</p>
<h2><b>Satan Offered Salvation without Risk</b></h2>
<p>The scriptures tell us that Satan once came before God in the premortal existence with a plan to redeem all mankind and not lose one soul. You all remember the story. In exchange for what he offered, the son of the morning wanted honor (<i>see</i> Moses 4:1) and the power of God (<i>see</i> D&amp;C 29:36, Moses 4:3). Because we had free agency there, as we do now, Satan induced one third of all of the spirit children of God to turn away from the plan proposed by Jesus Christ and to fight for his proposal (<i>see</i> D&amp;C 29:36, Abraham 3:28). When his scheme was rejected, Satan rebelled and sought to destroy the very agency he had to use to gain approval of his plan (<i>see</i> Moses 4:3).</p>
<p>But how did he manage to draw one third of us away from God? I believe that it was simply by saying that there were unnecessary hazards in Christ’s plan, and that the power of God was sufficient to save all men without effort and without the keeping of commandments. It was an attractive package. Many were deceived. In effect, they were offered salvation without risk. It wasn’t that our spirit brothers and sisters didn’t value free agency. They were undoubtedly taught about it and its importance. Probably they were committed to the concept, but because they were aware of the risks and were aware of their own weaknesses, they were unwilling to go to earth without a guaranteed round trip ticket. They valued the presence of God more than agency and lost both because they looked beyond the mark and could not see that it was impossible to have one without the other.</p>
<p>In a sense they wanted the mortal experience and a token probation. After punishment with a few stripes, they wanted to be returned again to that place they loved so much. But they were afraid of the real risk of mortality—of the discipline and the cost. They knew full well that there was death and evil inherent in the flesh (see 2 Nephi 2:29). They knew that many would find it difficult to walk by faith and would stumble and succumb to temptation (see Moses 5:7–8). They knew that without temptation they could not become agents unto themselves (see D&amp;C 29:39).</p>
<p>That price was unacceptable to many who did not want to leave home. They began to cast about for an easier way and, when it was offered, they accepted it. I have learned that the easy way to anything is almost always suspect.</p>
<h2><b>It Is a Blessing to Earn What We Receive</b></h2>
<p>After Adam’s transgression, the Lord told him that the ground would be cursed for his sake (<i>see</i> Moses 4:23). It is interesting to me that one definition of the word <i>sake</i> is benefit. Thus, cursed was the ground for Adam’s benefit. And by the sweat of his brow he was to earn his bread (<i>see</i> Moses 4:25). Work, then, was not to be a curse and earning things was to be a benefit.</p>
<p>This is still true today, notwithstanding the fact that much time and effort go into trying to beat the system. Work is still the ruling principle in the lives of the Latter-day Saints. We should not seek to acquire things without effort. Only that which is truly earned is ever really ours. It is a blessing to earn what we receive, and this applies to spiritual things as well.</p>
<p>I heard a sweet lady speak in church not long ago. She spoke of a difficult marriage and a husband who was unwilling to live the gospel. She spoke of abuse and emotional disorders. She spoke of trouble and debt. Real physical illness resulted from trying to hold her marriage together. My heart went out to her. Then she said, “But finally I asked my dear bishop what to do and he told me to get a divorce, so I did.”</p>
<p>She said, “dear.” She meant “poor.” Shame on a bishop who would tell a woman to get a divorce. The effect of doing that was to deprive the woman of the opportunity of paying the price for her own inspiration or revelation. Certainly she was entitled to it. But as with all other valuable things, there is a price attached. I do not know whether the bishop told her the right thing or not. But I do believe that there are no shortcuts to inspiration. The price is always praying and studying the matter in your mind. Often there is fasting and patient waiting. No earthly power can change all of that. I fear that the woman was trying to find the will of the Lord for her without paying the price. That simply cannot be done. Yet how many of us say to our bishops, “Tell me what to do”?</p>
<h2><b>“When You Find the Answer, Let Me Know”</b></h2>
<p>On one occasion I was with President Marion G. Romney. He spoke to a large gathering of young people. Afterwards, a returned missionary came up to shake his hand. As he did, he said, “President Romney, when I was a missionary I had a question that no one knew the answer to. Let me take advantage of your time for a moment and ask you.” He then asked a rather complicated question, the answer to which could have been found in the scriptures.</p>
<p>President Romney listened attentively for a few moments and then replied, “That is a very good question. When you find the answer, let me know, will you please?” As we left the hall he commented to me, obviously referring to the young man and his question, “My father taught me as a boy that when I wanted a drink I should go to where the spring flowed out of the ground and not downstream where the cattle had been muddying the water. He’ll be better off if he finds the answer for himself.”</p>
<p>But how easy it is to find someone else with the answers to our questions. How many want to know the mysteries of God without studying the scriptures? How many ask the Lord to do things which they should do for themselves? They forget there is no spiritual attainment without effort. The attitudes we sometimes develop in the world can be spiritually fatal if applied to such things as repentance or eternal marriage or keeping the commandments. Think of the consequences, for example, of asking, “Must I serve a mission?” compared to asking, “Can I serve a mission?”</p>
<h2><b>Several Reasons to Earn What We Get</b></h2>
<p>As I have thought about the subject, it seems that there are several reasons why the Lord wants us to earn what we get in this life.</p>
<p>First, if we get things without effort, we often fail to make the hard choices we were sent here to make. We may fail to exercise our agency and thereby be deprived of important blessings. We are then out of harmony with the Lord and lose the blessings and trials (for many trials are blessings) which he intended would be a part of our own particular probation. As an illustration, what would Cain have done to come up with an acceptable offering to the Lord, if he had not killed Abel? Could not introspection and prayer and an honest, humble sacrifice have made an eternal difference in his life?</p>
<p>Second, if we acquire things with little or no effort, we often develop an exaggerated view of our own ability and our own importance. If we think we are better than we really are, then we are in danger of not being sufficiently humble to be able to enter the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Third, when we get something for nothing, we often feel that others do the same. Then we become critical, feeling that patronage, nepotism, luck, influence, or favoritism have allowed them to acquire what they have. Jealousy and envy then easily enter our lives.</p>
<p>Fourth, when we get something for nothing, we often develop a delusion of being especially blessed by the Lord. This can discourage hard work on other projects and may bring great disappointment when similar slack efforts do not result in corresponding large rewards.</p>
<p>Fifth, when we get something for nothing, it is often at the expense of someone else’s loss. If the whole truth were known, offense might be taken. I do not want to be included among those about whom the Savior said, “Woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea” (Luke 17:1–2).</p>
<p>Last of all, things cheaply purchased are seldom appreciated. Attitudes which cause us to look for bargains in some areas of life will carry over (because as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he) into more important things. We may then come to seek testimony without study and spiritual power without cost, and the greatest blessings of life may be cheapened or lost altogether as a result.</p>
<p>There is an important lesson here for Latter-day Saints. Somehow, some way, sooner or later, whether we want it that way or not, there are some experiences that all men must have. There are some truths that all must learn. There is a relationship between what we give and what we get. Shortcuts are often hazardous to the important things, both in this life and the life to come. There are no spiritual shortcuts to anything. We must learn that peace of mind has its price and that there can be no exaltation without effort.</p>
<h2><b>The Satisfaction of Giving Lasts Longer</b></h2>
<p>I spoke about a young boy sitting on a street corner. I said it often depends on where you sit or where you stand with reference to the important issues, whether you get a reward or not. You may be interested to know where I stand as a humble servant of the Lord with reference to getting and giving. I am deeply conscious of my own weaknesses in this area. Yet, as I have seen the dangers and struggled with personal self-interest, I have found that the satisfaction of giving lasts much longer than the sweetness of getting. Like Abraham, I have found “greater happiness and peace and rest for me” (Abraham 1:2) when I render honest sacrifice and pay fair and adequate consideration for what I get.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>1. I have resolved never to ask the Church or anyone else to do for me what I should do for myself. Where possible, I prefer to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.</p>
<p>2. When I pray, I always try to pray “Thy will be done, not mine.” President Tanner once said that too many of us merely take a shopping list to the Lord when we pray. I try not to do that unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>3. As a lawyer, before being called as a General Authority, I never accepted a case which would cause me to bend the law or ignore the facts; or which would give my client a benefit he didn’t deserve. I still recoil from those who suggest such things and do not traffic with men and women who shade the truth for personal gain.</p>
<p>4. I am thankful that my eternal companion also believes in giving honest measure for what she gets. In fact, she gives more, and I appreciate that. It seems to me that a “something for nothing” attitude is inconsistent with eternal marriage.</p>
<p>5. I have never consciously misrepresented my income to the government, and have always paid taxes on that which I have earned. I have little sympathy with some vocal groups who look for ways to avoid this obligation. It seems to me that they want all of the benefits of democracy without paying for them.</p>
<p>6. Likewise, I have never misrepresented my income to my bishop. I have always tried to pay just a little bit more tithing than I owed. I avoid thinking in terms of net or gross income and believe that gifts or profits from sale of my property are included in my increase. I recognize that all that I have comes from the Lord. I would willingly give up a new sports car or boat or a vacation, just for the privilege of paying tithing. I have done this all of my life and I have no regrets.</p>
<p>7. I believe in the “second mile.” I have come to know that the first mile doesn’t count for much and the one freely given counts for everything.</p>
<p>8. I have learned to distrust praise and to seek honest humility, which I define to be a true and correct estimate of what I really am in the sight of God. No more and no less.</p>
<p>9. I never sign up for sweepstakes, prizes, giveaways, free offers or chances of a lifetime. As I wait in airports around the world, there are sometimes slot machines there to help passengers pass the time. I never put any money in them, even spare change. I am actually afraid I will win something.</p>
<p>10. I ask myself often, “What would Christ do?” and then try to do it. As the answer to that question comes, it almost always involves giving, not getting.</p>
<h2><b>There is No Exaltation without Effort</b></h2>
<p>As children we all learned the stories of the “Goose That Laid the Golden Egg,” of “Jack and the Magic Beans,” of “The Three Wishes,” and “King Midas,” whose touch turned everything to gold. But it was Paul who said,</p>
<p><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I become a man, I put away childish things. </i>[1 Corinthians 13:11]</p>
<p>I suppose that most of us have dreamed of inheriting a million dollars, or making a killing in a business venture, or even just being free of the work-a-day world in order to do what we want. But it is unworthy of a Latter-day Saint to spend his time trying to achieve these or other things without effort. The real reason for our mortal probation is to confront challenges, not escape them. It is to learn to give, not to learn to get. In earth life, as in the university life, we cannot complain about not getting passing grades if we are unwilling to take the test. There are no shortcuts to the plan of salvation. There is no exaltation without effort. We have nothing more important to do than to fully, honestly, and completely obey the laws upon which blessings are predicated. Make no mistake about it, we will reap what we sow (see Galatians 6:7).</p>
<p>It has always interested me that the broad way seems pleasant enough at first, while the narrow strait way initially does not. It has nothing to commend it to the advertisers of the world. It is difficult to sell. It is a toll road. The tariff is work, discipline, service, and love for others. It is paying the price for everything we get, then giving it away. Once entered into, however, those who travel the straight road are never the same. What at first seemed unpleasant will turn out to be the sweetest and most desirable road of all. It is what we give ourselves to that brings meaning and purpose into our lives—not what we get or gain. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is a pleasure to be with you.
Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote:
If the stars should appear [only] one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown [in the heavens]!1
Gazing upward into the blazing splendor of the night sky, we see thousands of distant stars and even more distant galaxies. This is truly amazing—and our reaction to it is equally remarkable. Think about what we do when we stargaze. Seeing light that left some distant suns about the time Columbus sailed for the New World, we immediately start ­creating associations between completely unrelated spheres—stars that are tens or hundreds of light years from each other and often even farther from the earth.
Making such mental connections gives the stars familiarity and meaning, and we begin to see them not only as separate points of light but as constellations—a scorpion, a hunter named Orion, or the Big Dipper.
There are practical uses for such astronomical inkblots. Try this: show your significant other pictures of various constellations and ask what he or she sees. If his answers are various types of weapons or characters from Middle Earth or if she replies, “I see a diamond engagement ring,” three out of four times, perhaps you should imitate the ancient mariners who navigated by the stars and make a course correction.
One example of my own astrological incompetence is that for many years I thought I was seeing all of Ursa Major, or the Big Bear, which, candidly, to me looked a lot like a big dipper. In fact, I thought the Big Dipper and the Big Bear were simply two names for the same group of seven stars—until a wise friend explained that the Big Dipper is not actually a constellation but merely an asterism, or part of a constellation. I learned that you must include another twelve stars for the Big Dipper to become the Big Bear. Now, obviously I had seen those twelve stars before, but I had failed to recognize how they connected to and expanded what I already knew.
Similarly, in the few minutes we share today, I propose to offer four points of light for your consideration, in hopes that by thinking about them together and by connecting them to stars already in your life’s sky, they will provide you with additional illumination and with greater direction in your life while at BYU and beyond.
A First Star: Work Is Work
Work is work, and that’s okay; it is acceptable, normal, expected, and part of the plan. Whether you are a BYU student, faculty member, or staff employee, if you don’t like work, you have come to the wrong university, and likely to the wrong planet. Schoolwork, missionary work, homework, and housework—the part-time job you have now and the career vocation you may one day take on—each of these will be wo</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I’m grateful to be here. I’ve been rather sleepless while preparing my remarks. I’ve felt some concern. But standing here today, seeing you all before me, I feel blessed—blessed to speak from a lectern where saints and scholars and prophets have spoken, and more blessed to come to this campus each day to teach and be taught by wonderful students who are my brothers and sisters and to work with faculty and staff who are reaching for something here that is more than a job.
Today I want to address my remarks to you who may be feeling tired and a little worn down, who may be struggling with feelings of frustration about being a student at BYU, and who may even be feeling a little cynical about what we’re trying to accomplish here. There are some challenging days. There are days when a teacher, an administrator, a classmate, or a roommate does not speak or act as one should in Zion. There are days when you and I do not speak or act as we should in Zion. There are days when we’re confused about a policy or process here that seems inconsistent with the principles of Zion. Sometimes we experience a bit of emotional whiplash when our lives get bumped hard by an experience or a challenge that is painful—painful enough that it pulls us up short and we find ourselves saying, “Wait a minute! I thought this was BYU, the Lord’s school. I thought it was Heavenly Father’s will that I be a BYU student. What in the world is going on here?” You may chuckle—perhaps a bit nervously—at that representation. If you do, it’s probably because you have had some experiences along these lines. And so it’s to you that I address my remarks.
BYU is not Zion. Not yet. It is Zion’s university—and it is under construction. It is a work in progress. However—and this is the core of my remarks today—here at BYU it is not an academic program or an athletic program or even a missionary or leadership program that is under construction. It is you. You and I are the whole point of it.
Occasionally it is my great privilege to host colleagues from other universities and other faiths who come to present their academic work in the Marriott School. On several occasions I have begun the day by driving my colleague to a place overlooking campus. From this vantage point we can see BYU as well as the Provo Temple and the Missionary Training Center. My objective is to begin the day with a visual of what BYU is all about. I speak briefly to my guest about you students—who come here to learn and in whom so much hope is placed by the Church, as evidenced by investments made in your education. I talk about how the learning that occurs simultaneously at the MTC and at the temple imbues a larger sense of purpose to us here on campus. I share this because I believe that my guests have good hearts and will reverence the message. I believe that they are impressed by the vision of what they see. I hope that this view is endo</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I enjoy pondering apparent gospel paradoxes. Jesus taught: “Be ye therefore perfect.”1 Yet Paul counseled, “Be content with such things as ye have.”2 Nephi wrote: “Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!”3 And yet “all is well” are the very words of the refrain in a beloved hymn that chimes across BYU campus each hour.
That same hourly chime also reminds us “no toil nor labor fear.”4 We have labored long and hard to be here at this commencement. We honor those who have worked beyond the normal measure, who of necessity have had 4 a.m. janitorial employment or those like Chris Peterman, graduating with us in manufacturing engineering and technology, who stayed in school and raised his son alone after losing his wife to cancer during his freshman year. We thank those professors, parents, and others who have also labored that we might be here.
However, for most of us the roads of the future will be longer and harder than those we have already walked. Unlike the world, we must not worship the idol of idleness. In an adaptation of Bertrand Russell, I would say that most men would rather die than work, and many do,5 losing in laziness the life they had longed for. A life of leisure is not a right to which we are somehow entitled. Working late into the night to write a paper is not somehow unfair. The economic development of the last two centuries has freed us from the necessity of near-constant labor, but we still are not free from the divine injunction that man is to live by the sweat of his face.6 R&amp;R should not be the goals of our work but rather tools to help us work effectively.
Though we should work to produce, we must not let our works produce unrighteous pride. In humility we must recall, as Shelley observed, that “the lone and level sands” of time will wipe away anything we build on this earth.7 Then why work? Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught: “The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of . . . what we have done. It is an acknowledgment of . . . what we have become.”8 Work changes us in at least two major ways.
First, we come to value that for which we must work. According to the biblical account, Laban did not require Jacob to work seven years for Rachel; Jacob loved her and he offered to work seven years for her,9 and I believe he knew he would love her the more for it. Those of us who are graduating single have not yet been notified about the fabled tuition refund, yet I think that we will love our future spouse the more for all the awkward dating moments at movies, malt shops, and miniature golf courses.
Work reveals worth and thus brings joy. While I was in high school, my family held scripture memorization contests each year at Christmas. Participants had to memorize all of the seminary scripture mastery scriptures and compete against my fat</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to express my appreciation to all the priesthood leaders and their wives who are here with us this evening. I’m especially grateful that Elder and Sister Cecil O. Samuelson are here. It was a great privilege to labor with Elder Samuelson in the Temple Department for many years. I can assure the students at Brigham Young University, as well as the faculty, that they are blessed under the able leadership of President and Sister Samuelson.
Tonight as I’ve thought about what I wanted to say to you, the young people of the Church, it has occurred to me that many are students. The reality is, my dear young friends, that we are all students of the gospel, aren’t we?
There was a man who worked for the United States Treasury Department. His job was investigating cases where counterfeit money was involved. He was so good at what he did that all it took was a quick look at a bill and he could tell if it was genuine or counterfeit. One evening at a press conference following his breaking up of a major counterfeit ring, one of the reporters directed this statement to him: “You must spend a lot of time studying counterfeit bills to recognize them so easily.”
His reply to this was, “No, I don’t ever study counterfeit bills. I spend my time studying genuine bills; then the imperfection is easy to recognize.”
So it is with the gospel, dear brothers and sisters. We are here to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. There is no need to study the counterfeit, for we have the truth. As you study the true Church and allow the Spirit to work within you, you will have the answers and come to know how to respond to the various situations you will face. Concerning the Book of Mormon, a young missionary shared this thought with me, which I have found to be true over the years: Remember that the Book of Mormon is not on trial—we are.
This evening I would like to speak with you concerning one of the most essential principles of the entire gospel. I speak of the doctrine of work. It is my hope that what I say will help guide you in the work you are now doing or may be doing in the future.
Those of you who are graduating from high school or college, or are otherwise in the work force, may be asking yourselves questions like this when you apply for employment: “What are my working hours? What are my fringe benefits? What holidays will I have off? Will I have enough time to hang out with my friends or pursue my hobbies?” With questions like these, however, when you focus on your leisure hours instead of your working hours, you may be prevented from seeing a much greater opportunity.
God’s Work
Work is an eternal principle. Whom do you know who has all the riches of the earth and more and yet is continually working? Our Heavenly Father! He is a worker. Our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have shown us by Their examples and teachings that work is important in heaven and on earth. J</span>
