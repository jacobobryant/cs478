  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="The time is drawing near when books will be closed and hearts and thoughts turned toward home. Like the shepherds of old who journeyed to the manger marked by the star, many of you will travel to a place where a special star hangs over your home - a holy place, a place where love and confidence increase with the years.

Christmas is a busy season. Streets and stores are filled with people making last-minute preparations. Travelers on the highways increase, airports are crowded - all Christianity seems to come to life with music, lights, and festive decorations.

A writer has said:

&lt;i&gt;Of all the holidays there is none that enters so fully into the human heart, and stirs so many of the higher sentiments. The thoughts, memories, hopes, and customs linked with it are bound by antiquity and nationality collectively; and by childhood and old age individually. They embrace the religious, social, and patriotic sides of our nature. The holly and mistletoe entwined among the evergreens, the habit of giving gifts to those we love, the presence of the Christmas tree, the superstition of Santa Claus, all combining to make Christmas the most longed-for, the most universal, and from every standpoint, the most important holiday known to man.&lt;/i&gt; [Clarence Baird, "The Spirit of Christmas," &lt;i&gt;Improvement Era,&lt;/i&gt; 23:154 (December 1919)]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Origin of Christmas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The season is steeped in tradition and its roots stem back in history. The commencement of the holiday lies in pagan worship long before the introduction of Christianity. The god Mithra was worshiped by the ancient Aryans, and this worship gradually spread to India and Persia. Mithra at first was the god of the heavenly light of the bright skies and later in the Roman period was worshiped as the deity of the sun, or the sun-god - &lt;i&gt;Sol Invictus Mithra.&lt;/i&gt;

In the first century after Christ, Pompey carried on conquests along the southern coast of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, and many of the prisoners taken in those military actions were brought captive to Rome. This introduced the pagan worship of Mithra to Rome, for these prisoners spread the religion among the Roman soldiers. The worship became popular, particularly in the ranks of the Roman armies. We find today, in the ruins of the cities of the far-flung Roman Empire, the shrines of Mithra. Mithraism flourished in the Roman world and became the chief competitor of Christianity in the religious beliefs of the people.

A festive season for the worshipers of the sun-god took place immediately after the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year - the time when the sun stands still after its annual dip into the Southern Hemisphere. The commencement of its climb from this low point was regarded as the rebirth of Mithra, and the Romans celebrated his birthday on the twenty-fifth of December each year. There was great merriment on this holiday - festivals and feastings, gifts given to friends, and the dwelling places decorated with evergreens.

Gradually Christianity gained a victory over Mithraism, which had been its strongest rival, and the festival day celebrating the birth of Mithra was used by the Christians to commemorate the birth of Christ. The pagan worship of the sun, deeply rooted in Roman culture, was replaced by one of the greatest festivals among Christians. Christmas has come down to us as a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing - a day of good cheer and goodwill to men. Although it has an earthly relation and significance, it is divine in content. The ancient Christian celebration has lived continuously through the centuries.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Meaning of Christmas Today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
How is Christmas regarded today? The legend of Santa Claus, the Christmas tree, the decorations of tinsel and mistletoe, and the giving of gifts all express to us the spirit of the day we celebrate; but the true spirit of Christmas lies much deeper than these. It is found in the life of the Savior, in the principles he taught, in his atoning sacrifice - which becomes our great heritage.

Many years ago the First Presidency of the Church made this significant statement:

&lt;i&gt;Christmas, to the Latter-day Saint, is both reminiscent and prophetic - a reminder of two great and solemn events, which will yet be regarded universally as the mightiest and most wonderful happenings in the history of the human race. These events were predestined to take place upon this planet before it was created. One of these was the coming of the Savior in the meridian of time, to die for the sins of the world; and the other is the prospective event of the risen and glorified Redeemer, to reign upon the earth as King of kings.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Millennial Star,&lt;/i&gt; 70:1 (January 2, 1908)]

In Pauls short letter to the Galatians, he showed great concern over their apparent disbelief and their forsaking of his teachings regarding Christ. He wrote to them: "But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you. . . ." (Gal. 4:1819). In other words, Paul expressed himself as suffering pain and anxiety until Christ be "formed" in them. This is another way of saying "in Christ," as that expression is used by Paul repeatedly in his writings.

It is possible for Christ to be born in mens lives, and when such an experience actually happens, a man is "in Christ" - Christ is "formed" in him. This presupposes that we take Christ into our hearts and make him the living contemporary of our lives. He is not just a general truth or a fact in history, but the Savior of men everywhere and at all times. When we strive to be Christlike, he is "formed" in us; if we open the door, he will enter; if we seek his counsel, he will counsel us. For Christ to be "formed" in us, we must have a belief in him and in his atonement. Such a belief in Christ, and the keeping of his commandments, are not restraints upon us. By these, men are set free. This Prince of Peace waits to give peace of mind which may make each of us a channel of that peace.

The real Christmas comes to him who has taken Christ into his life as a moving, dynamic, vitalizing force. The real spirit of Christmas lies in the life and mission of the Master. I continue with what the writer defines as the real spirit of Christmas:

&lt;i&gt;It is a desire to sacrifice for others, to render service and to possess a feeling of universal brotherhood. It consists of a willingness to forget what you have done for others, and to remember what others have done for you; to ignore what the world owes you, and think only of your duties in the middle distance, and your chance to do good and aid your fellow-men in the foreground - to see that your fellow-men are just as good as you are, and try to look behind their faces to their hearts - to close your book of grievances against the universe, and look about you for a place to sow a few seeds of happiness, and go your way unobserved.&lt;/i&gt; [Baird, p. 154]

In his contemplation of the Christmas season, John Wallingford penned these lines:

&lt;i&gt;Christmas is not a day or a season, but a&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;condition of heart and mind.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If we love our neighbors as ourselves;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if in our riches we are poor in spirit and in&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;our poverty we are rich in grace;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if our charity vaunteth not itself, but suffereth long and is kind;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if when our brother asks for a loaf, we give&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ourselves instead;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if each day dawns in opportunity and sets in&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;achievement, however small;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;then every day is Christs day and Christmas&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is always near.&lt;/i&gt;

A wise man has said:

&lt;i&gt;The most amazing thing about the Christmas story is its relevance. It is at home in every age and fits into every mood of life. It is not simply a lovely tale once told, but eternally contemporary. It is the voice crying out in every wilderness. It is as meaningful in our time as in that long-ago night when shepherds followed the light of the star to the manger of Bethlehem.&lt;/i&gt; [Joseph R. Sizoo, &lt;i&gt;Words of Life,&lt;/i&gt; p. 33]

It has been said that Christmas is for children; but as the years of childhood fancy pass away and an understanding maturity takes their place, the simple teaching of the Savior that "it is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35) becomes a reality. The evolution from a pagan holiday transformed into a Christian festival, to the birth of Christ in mens lives, is another form of maturity that comes to one who has been touched by the gospel of Jesus Christ.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find the True Spirit of Christmas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
If you desire to find the true spirit of Christmas and partake of the sweetness of it, let me make this suggestion to you. During the hurry of the festive occasion of this Christmas season, find time to turn your heart to God. Perhaps in the quiet hours, and in a quiet place, and on your knees - alone or with loved ones - give thanks for the good things that have come to you, and ask that his spirit might dwell in you as you earnestly strive to serve him and keep his commandments. He will take you by the hand and his promises will be kept.

I know that God lives. I bear witness of the divinity of his Son, the Savior of the world, and I express appreciation for the blessing of having upon the earth a prophet of the living God.

In closing I would like to say that President Harold B. Lee has asked that I extend to you his love and the heartfelt greetings of the Board of Trustees to the administration, the faculty, and the student body of this great university.

May God bless each of you this day and always is the prayer I humbly ask. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>The time is drawing near when books will be closed and hearts and thoughts turned toward home. Like the shepherds of old who journeyed to the manger marked by the star, many of you will travel to a place where a special star hangs over your home - a holy place, a place where love and confidence increase with the years.</p>
<p>Christmas is a busy season. Streets and stores are filled with people making last-minute preparations. Travelers on the highways increase, airports are crowded - all Christianity seems to come to life with music, lights, and festive decorations.</p>
<p>A writer has said:</p>
<p><i>Of all the holidays there is none that enters so fully into the human heart, and stirs so many of the higher sentiments. The thoughts, memories, hopes, and customs linked with it are bound by antiquity and nationality collectively; and by childhood and old age individually. They embrace the religious, social, and patriotic sides of our nature. The holly and mistletoe entwined among the evergreens, the habit of giving gifts to those we love, the presence of the Christmas tree, the superstition of Santa Claus, all combining to make Christmas the most longed-for, the most universal, and from every standpoint, the most important holiday known to man.</i> [Clarence Baird, "The Spirit of Christmas," <i>Improvement Era,</i> 23:154 (December 1919)]</p>
<h2><b>The Origin of Christmas</b></h2>
<p>The season is steeped in tradition and its roots stem back in history. The commencement of the holiday lies in pagan worship long before the introduction of Christianity. The god Mithra was worshiped by the ancient Aryans, and this worship gradually spread to India and Persia. Mithra at first was the god of the heavenly light of the bright skies and later in the Roman period was worshiped as the deity of the sun, or the sun-god - <i>Sol Invictus Mithra.</i></p>
<p>In the first century after Christ, Pompey carried on conquests along the southern coast of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, and many of the prisoners taken in those military actions were brought captive to Rome. This introduced the pagan worship of Mithra to Rome, for these prisoners spread the religion among the Roman soldiers. The worship became popular, particularly in the ranks of the Roman armies. We find today, in the ruins of the cities of the far-flung Roman Empire, the shrines of Mithra. Mithraism flourished in the Roman world and became the chief competitor of Christianity in the religious beliefs of the people.</p>
<p>A festive season for the worshipers of the sun-god took place immediately after the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year - the time when the sun stands still after its annual dip into the Southern Hemisphere. The commencement of its climb from this low point was regarded as the rebirth of Mithra, and the Romans celebrated his birthday on the twenty-fifth of December each year. There was great merriment on this holiday - festivals and feastings, gifts given to friends, and the dwelling places decorated with evergreens.</p>
<p>Gradually Christianity gained a victory over Mithraism, which had been its strongest rival, and the festival day celebrating the birth of Mithra was used by the Christians to commemorate the birth of Christ. The pagan worship of the sun, deeply rooted in Roman culture, was replaced by one of the greatest festivals among Christians. Christmas has come down to us as a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing - a day of good cheer and goodwill to men. Although it has an earthly relation and significance, it is divine in content. The ancient Christian celebration has lived continuously through the centuries.</p>
<h2><b>The Meaning of Christmas Today</b></h2>
<p>How is Christmas regarded today? The legend of Santa Claus, the Christmas tree, the decorations of tinsel and mistletoe, and the giving of gifts all express to us the spirit of the day we celebrate; but the true spirit of Christmas lies much deeper than these. It is found in the life of the Savior, in the principles he taught, in his atoning sacrifice - which becomes our great heritage.</p>
<p>Many years ago the First Presidency of the Church made this significant statement:</p>
<p><i>Christmas, to the Latter-day Saint, is both reminiscent and prophetic - a reminder of two great and solemn events, which will yet be regarded universally as the mightiest and most wonderful happenings in the history of the human race. These events were predestined to take place upon this planet before it was created. One of these was the coming of the Savior in the meridian of time, to die for the sins of the world; and the other is the prospective event of the risen and glorified Redeemer, to reign upon the earth as King of kings.</i> [<i>Millennial Star,</i> 70:1 (January 2, 1908)]</p>
<p>In Pauls short letter to the Galatians, he showed great concern over their apparent disbelief and their forsaking of his teachings regarding Christ. He wrote to them: "But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you. . . ." (Gal. 4:1819). In other words, Paul expressed himself as suffering pain and anxiety until Christ be "formed" in them. This is another way of saying "in Christ," as that expression is used by Paul repeatedly in his writings.</p>
<p>It is possible for Christ to be born in mens lives, and when such an experience actually happens, a man is "in Christ" - Christ is "formed" in him. This presupposes that we take Christ into our hearts and make him the living contemporary of our lives. He is not just a general truth or a fact in history, but the Savior of men everywhere and at all times. When we strive to be Christlike, he is "formed" in us; if we open the door, he will enter; if we seek his counsel, he will counsel us. For Christ to be "formed" in us, we must have a belief in him and in his atonement. Such a belief in Christ, and the keeping of his commandments, are not restraints upon us. By these, men are set free. This Prince of Peace waits to give peace of mind which may make each of us a channel of that peace.</p>
<p>The real Christmas comes to him who has taken Christ into his life as a moving, dynamic, vitalizing force. The real spirit of Christmas lies in the life and mission of the Master. I continue with what the writer defines as the real spirit of Christmas:</p>
<p><i>It is a desire to sacrifice for others, to render service and to possess a feeling of universal brotherhood. It consists of a willingness to forget what you have done for others, and to remember what others have done for you; to ignore what the world owes you, and think only of your duties in the middle distance, and your chance to do good and aid your fellow-men in the foreground - to see that your fellow-men are just as good as you are, and try to look behind their faces to their hearts - to close your book of grievances against the universe, and look about you for a place to sow a few seeds of happiness, and go your way unobserved.</i> [Baird, p. 154]</p>
<p>In his contemplation of the Christmas season, John Wallingford penned these lines:</p>
<p><i>Christmas is not a day or a season, but a</i><br />
<i>condition of heart and mind.</i><br />
<i>If we love our neighbors as ourselves;</i><br />
<i>if in our riches we are poor in spirit and in</i><br />
<i>our poverty we are rich in grace;</i><br />
<i>if our charity vaunteth not itself, but suffereth long and is kind;</i><br />
<i>if when our brother asks for a loaf, we give</i><br />
<i>ourselves instead;</i><br />
<i>if each day dawns in opportunity and sets in</i><br />
<i>achievement, however small;</i><br />
<i>then every day is Christs day and Christmas</i><br />
<i>is always near.</i></p>
<p>A wise man has said:</p>
<p><i>The most amazing thing about the Christmas story is its relevance. It is at home in every age and fits into every mood of life. It is not simply a lovely tale once told, but eternally contemporary. It is the voice crying out in every wilderness. It is as meaningful in our time as in that long-ago night when shepherds followed the light of the star to the manger of Bethlehem.</i> [Joseph R. Sizoo, <i>Words of Life,</i> p. 33]</p>
<p>It has been said that Christmas is for children; but as the years of childhood fancy pass away and an understanding maturity takes their place, the simple teaching of the Savior that "it is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35) becomes a reality. The evolution from a pagan holiday transformed into a Christian festival, to the birth of Christ in mens lives, is another form of maturity that comes to one who has been touched by the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2><b>Find the True Spirit of Christmas</b></h2>
<p>If you desire to find the true spirit of Christmas and partake of the sweetness of it, let me make this suggestion to you. During the hurry of the festive occasion of this Christmas season, find time to turn your heart to God. Perhaps in the quiet hours, and in a quiet place, and on your knees - alone or with loved ones - give thanks for the good things that have come to you, and ask that his spirit might dwell in you as you earnestly strive to serve him and keep his commandments. He will take you by the hand and his promises will be kept.</p>
<p>I know that God lives. I bear witness of the divinity of his Son, the Savior of the world, and I express appreciation for the blessing of having upon the earth a prophet of the living God.</p>
<p>In closing I would like to say that President Harold B. Lee has asked that I extend to you his love and the heartfelt greetings of the Board of Trustees to the administration, the faculty, and the student body of this great university.</p>
<p>May God bless each of you this day and always is the prayer I humbly ask. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful to be with you on this cold December morning. I pray that the warmth of the Spirit will bless us that we might be edified during our few moments together.
Today I want to talk with you about the greatest story ever told - and one of its less obvious but most important themes. You could probably recite much of this story by heart. It occupies little more than a page of scripture. It begins with the familiar duty of paying taxes. It continues with a journey that was not unusual for the time. The plot thickens when no room can be found "in the inns";1 it culminates when the Son of God is born of Mary, "a precious and chosen" virgin.2
We know little about the real people and few details regarding the true events. And yet, no matter how many times we read the story of the first Christmas, there always seems to be something new we can learn from it. That is because, as prophets have taught, "the word of God is quick," or living.3 It takes on fresh and deeper meaning whenever we are spiritually ready to receive it.
Something that stands out to me in the account of the Saviors birth is that on four separate occasions an angel appeared with the message "Fear not."
When the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias with news that his wife would bear a son, the forerunner of the Messiah, he said, "Fear not, . . . for thy prayer is heard."4
Later the same angel visited "beautiful and fair"5 Mary to tell her that she would be the mother of the Son of God, assuring her with similar words: "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."6
Shortly thereafter an angel appeared to Joseph the carpenter in a dream and said, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife."7
And then, on that holy night, as all eternity watched in reverent silence, the angel came upon humble shepherds keeping watch over their flock. The shepherds, who "were sore afraid,"8 heard the angel proclaim, "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."9
So much of what happened during those pivotal moments in the nativity narrative depended upon the courage of people like Zacharias, Mary, Joseph, and the shepherds. God had a monumental task for each of them; their lives were about to change forever. Imagine if they had let fear overcome them. What if they had pulled back, doubted, and failed to do what God needed them to do?
This less obvious theme from the account of the first Christmas intrigues me because I, like you, have fears, and I need to be reminded at times to fear not. I dont know what your fears are. Like Zacharias, who feared that he would never have children, you may have fears about your family. Or maybe your fear isnt that you wont have children but that you will have children, whom you will have to r</span>

So, in conclusion, I love Christmas and I love BYU devotionals. I am grateful to be with you, and my older siblings, graduates of BYU, are here, having traveled from Arizona and Idaho. They must have thought I was graduating today. Im not saying my older siblings are old, but there were no history classes on campus when they attended, just current events. The deodorant Old Spice was then known as New Spice, and the Dead Sea was just mildly sick.
Since my academic focus is education law, and since much of that discipline and practice is focused on protecting the rights and persons of children, Id like to discuss what it means in the perfect economy of the Lords kingdom to become as a little child. I believe Christmas and the birth of the Christ child help us explore this concept.
Becoming as a Little Child
When our Heavenly Father wanted to save the world, He didnt take over a country or develop a militia. He sent a helpless child to a choice and worthy woman and a humble and believing man living in insecure circumstances in a conquered land occupied by a hostile force. The harsh geopolitical and military circumstances of Christs birth should remind us that Heavenly Father can bless us even if the external circumstances of our lives arent necessarily easy or peaceful.
Herod the Great ruled over that land, under Romes ultimate control. He was mighty and built magnificent monuments - at least one of which overshadowed the land when Christ was born, being visible in all directions for miles. We cant help but contrast Herods mighty palace with the stable. If we knew for sure where the stable was, wouldnt we wish to visit the site of that sacred birth? But who cares as much about anything Herod built, besides perhaps one or two of our learned faculty members? Most of us with a normal threshold for boredom ignore Herod.
Christ is infinitely more important. We seek Christs words and probably have many of His words memorized. Well, not everyone does apparently, because Im always surprised on Jeopardy when those brainiacs often seem to know nothing about the scriptures. We Mormons, in turn, are continually lost on the "Potent Potables" category. We celebrate and rejoice in the words and the happenings of Christs birth. Does anyone, even the most bookishly versant among us, celebrate the words or circumstances of Herod and his birth?
The New Testament shows us something of the Christ child we celebrate at Christmas in the perfect young adult He has become. He hasnt become full of Himself and self-important, careworn, and brusque. Although Isaiah described Him as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted wi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Beloved students, faculty, and friends of Brigham Young University, you are a marvelous sight, and Susan and I are honored and full of gratitude to be with you today. We always feel tender feelings when we return to Brigham Young University, as this is where we met and were engaged. We met in a religion class called Your Religious Problems. I have forgotten many of the details of the class, but I do know that whatever my religious problem was, she solved it, and whatever her problem was, well, I hope I solved it too.
In a very short while your final exams will end and you will return to family or friends for Christmas. In view of the approaching Yuletide season, I have chosen to share with you today a Christmas message, a message of hope and glad tidings, even my assurance and witness of the birth, life, and eternal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
More than 700 years before his birth, Isaiah prophesied of Christ in words memorialized by George Frideric Handel in the Messiah oratorio:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. [Isaiah 9:6]
In this one concise sentence, Isaiah foretold Christs birth; His Second Coming; His millennial reign; and His eternal mission as the mighty God and Father of our salvation.
Handels Messiah also brought to glorious musical life the following admonition, based on Isaiah:
O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, . . . O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! [Handel, "O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion," Messiah; see Isaiah 40:9]
Brothers and sisters, join with me and behold your God! Behold your God, born as a little child in Bethlehem and wrapped in swaddling clothes. Behold your God, born in poverty and simplicity that He might walk among common people as a common man. Behold your God, even the infinite and eternal Redeemer, the Messiah, veiled in flesh and come to live upon the very earth that He created.
Return with me to that sacred first Christmas in Bethlehem to contemplate the birth of our Lord. He came in the quiet of the night, in the meridian of time, He who was Immanuel, the Rod of Jesse, the Dayspring, the Key of David, the very Lord of Might. His birth marked the promised visitation of the Creator to earth, the condescension of God to man. As Isaiah wrote of the event:
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. [Isaiah 9:2]
We know from modern revelation that Jesus was born on April 6, making it springtime in Judea when the anointed King of Israel came to earth. As Micah had prophes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">With Christmas only a fortnight away, thoughts turn to our homes and families. Sister Nelson and I enjoy many Christmas traditions. On our mantle over the fireplace we display a small framed photograph of each member of the family. With 10 children, their spouses, and 54 grandchildren, thats quite a flock of photos. We have been doing this for so long that most of the pictures are no longer current. The children scramble to find their own pictures among the many.
They also admire Sister Nelsons large assortment of dolls collected from various countries throughout the world. Those dolls are nestled among the branches of our Christmas tree. Her cookies, cakes, and candies are always in great demand. And we love to read scriptures of the Christmas story with our family.
Through all of our various Christmas traditions, I hope that we are focused first upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men still adore Him. At this special devotional, many of you have come with a prayer in your hearts that you may learn from one of the Twelve Apostles more about our Lord and Master.
We commemorate His humble birth at this time of year, even though we know it did not occur in December but more likely in April. Scriptures declare that His mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph. They had participated in the first of two components of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Their espousal might be likened to an engagement in our culture, which is followed later by the second component of a marriage ceremony.
Lukes account records the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mary when she first learned of her favored future. I read from chapter 1:
"Hail, thou that art highly favoured . . . : blessed art thou among women. . . .
"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest."1 (Note the capital S; capital H.)
God is the Highest. Jesus was to be the Son of the Highest.
"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"2
She knew of her virginal status.
"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."3
Before Joseph and Mary came together, she was expecting that holy child. Joseph desired to protect her privacy,4 hoping to spare Mary the punishment given to a woman pregnant without a completed marriage. While he pondered these things, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph, saying,
"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
"And she shall bri</span>
