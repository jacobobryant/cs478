  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I love to be among the youth of the Church. I love your energy, your optimism, your faith. I have heard others say they always feel younger when they spend time with young people. This has always been my experience.

It is good to be here today. I felt a certain thrill as I watched you enter this great Marriott Center. I noticed the beautiful smiling faces, the well-kept hair, the appropriate dress. I thank you for being here today.

Think for a moment, if you will, of someone you know who is truly happy. Weve all met those who seem to radiate happiness. They seem to smile more than others, they laugh more than others - just being around them makes us happier as well.

Now think of someone you know who isnt happy at all. Perhaps they seem 10 years older than they are, drained of energy - perhaps they are angry or bitter or depressed.

What is the difference between them? What are the characteristics that differentiate the happy from the miserable? Is there something that unhappy people can do to be happier? I believe there is.

Let me tell you a story to illustrate this observation.

A long time ago in a faraway village lived a man who everyone did their very best to avoid. He was the type of person who believed that there was only one competent person in the world, and that one person was himself. Consequently he was never satisfied with anything. His shoes never fit right. His shirt never felt comfortable. When his food wasnt too cold, it was too salty, and when it wasnt too hot, it was too bland.

If a field wasnt sowed by himself, it was not sowed well. If he didnt close the door, the door was not closed properly.

In short, he made a career of frowning, lecturing, criticizing, and mumbling about the incompetencies of every other person in the rest of the world.

Unfortunately, the man was married, which made matters all the worse. No matter what his wife did, in his eyes it was wrong. No matter what the unfortunate woman cooked, sewed, or cleaned, or even when she milked the cow, it was never satisfactory, and he let her know it.

She tried very hard to be a good wife, but it seemed the harder she tried the less she pleased him. Finally, one evening she could take no more.

"Ill tell you what well do," she told him. "Tomorrow I will do your chores and you will do mine."

"But you cant do my chores," the man replied. "You dont know the first thing about sowing, hoeing, and irrigating."

But the woman was adamant. And on top of that, she was filled with a righteous anger that frankly astonished and frightened the man to the point where he didnt dare disagree.

So the next morning the wife went off to the fields and the man began the domestic chores. After thinking about it, he had actually convinced himself he was looking forward to it. Once and for all, he would demonstrate to his wife how things should be done.

Unfortunately, not everything went according to plan. In fact, nearly everything the man touched turned into disaster. He spilled the milk, let the pig get into the house, lost the cow, burned the dinner, and ultimately set the house on fire, narrowly escaping with his own life.

When his wife returned, she discovered her husband sitting on a pile of ashes, smoke still rising from his clothes. But the woman wasnt the type to rub things in. She helped him up, wiped the soot from his beard, fixed him a little something to eat, and then prepared a bed of straw for them to sleep on.

From that day forward, the man never complained about anyone or anything else for as long as he lived.

What do you suppose this story teaches us?

For one thing, it teaches that those who complain make their own and others lives miserable. The story also teaches humility. It reminds us that "pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall" (Proverbs 16:18). It teaches us not to judge others until we walk in their shoes for a while.

In addition, the story illustrates a quality that the Roman orator Cicero claimed was "not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others" (Marcus Tullius Cicero, &lt;i&gt;Pro Plancio,&lt;/i&gt; 54 B.C.). It is a quality I have found in every happy person I know. It is a quality that instantly makes a person more likable and more at peace. Where there is an abundance, there is happiness. Where there is an absence, there is often sadness, resentment, and futility.

The virtue I am speaking of is gratitude.

In our story, it was the absence of gratitude that made the man miserable. His inability to appreciate others caused him to be critical of their efforts. Not only did he not empathize with them, he could not allow himself to acknowledge their contributions.

The disasters that confronted him surely made him humble, but, more particularly, they made him appreciate and be grateful for his wife.

Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.

You might be surprised to know that gratitude is a commandment of the Father. "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 59:7), the Lord has commanded in these latter days. Even further, He has admonished that "in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21).

In the Book of Mormon we learn that we should "live in thanksgiving daily" (Alma 34:38). Isnt that a wonderful thought? To live in thanksgiving daily? Can you imagine how your life would improve if you lived in thanksgiving daily? Can you imagine how your life would improve if others did the same? Do you think the world would be a happier place? Less stressful? Less angry? More spiritual?

President Joseph F. Smith proclaimed:

&lt;i&gt;The grateful man sees so much in the world to be thankful for, and with him the good outweighs the evil. Love overpowers jealousy, and light drives darkness out of his life. Pride destroys our gratitude and sets up selfishness in its place. How much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul, and how careful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude toward God and man!&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;GD,&lt;/i&gt; 263]

A few minutes ago I asked you to think of someone you knew who was truly happy. Think of the person again, if you will, and grade on this principle: Does he or she live in thanksgiving daily?

Now think of someone you know who is unhappy or resentful. Does this person live in thanksgiving daily?

It is difficult to even imagine a resentful person who is grateful or a grateful person who is resentful. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:

&lt;i&gt;Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. It expresses itself in ugly egotism and frequently in wanton mischief. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Where there is appreciation, there is courtesy, there is concern for the rights and property of others. Without it, there is arrogance and evil.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; October 1964, 117]

I believe that many people are unhappy because they have not learned to be grateful. Some carry the burden of bitterness and resentfulness for many years. Some pass their days as though suffering a deep sadness they cannot name. Others are unhappy because life didnt turn out the way they thought it would.

"If only I had money," some might say to themselves, "then I could be happy."

"If only I were better looking."

"If only I were smarter."

"If only I had a new car, a college degree, a job, a wife, hair that wasnt so frizzy." (Or, in my case, if only I had more hair or I was 12 inches taller.)

If we only look around us, there are a thousand reasons for us not to be happy, and it is simplicity itself to blame our unhappiness on the things we lack in life. It doesnt take any talent at all to find them. The problem is, the more we focus on the things we dont have, the unhappier and more resentful we become.

Over the course of my years, I have met thousands of people. I have dined with the prosperous as well as the poverty-stricken. I have conversed with the mighty and with the meek. I have walked with the famous and the feeble. I have run with outstanding athletes and those who are not athletically inclined.

One thing I can tell you with certainty is this: You cannot predict happiness by the amount of money, fame, or power a person has. External conditions do not necessarily make a person happy. The brethren who have had assignments in Africa report that despite the abject poverty, the people are very happy. The fact is that the external things so valued by the world are often the cause of a great deal of misery in the world.

Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, are usually among the worlds happiest people. And they make others happy as well.

Years ago Elder J. Golden Kimball was traveling with one of the presiding brethren in southern Utah. In those days meetings often didnt have a time limit; they went on as long as the speaker wanted to speak. For those of you looking for something to be grateful for, perhaps Ive just given you one idea.

One fast Sunday they had been preaching nearly all day. Everyone was hungry, especially Elder Kimball, who felt that he "was pretty nearly dead."

Finally, at about four oclock in the afternoon, the presiding apostle turned and said, "Now, Brother Kimball, get up and tell them about the &lt;i&gt;Era."&lt;/i&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;Era&lt;/i&gt; magazine had just been launched, and the Brethren wanted to encourage subscriptions. Elder Kimball approached the pulpit and then, after a short pause, said, "All you men that will take the &lt;i&gt;Era&lt;/i&gt; if we will let you go home, raise your right hand." There was not a single man who did not raise his hand that day and subscribe to the &lt;i&gt;Era.&lt;/i&gt; (In J. Golden Kimball, &lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; April 1932, 78.)

You see, the power of gratitude is immense.

Rulon Gardner grew up in the small town of Afton, Wyoming. He is one of nine children. His mother and father are faithful members of the Church and instilled proper values in their children.

But because Rulon was so large, his classmates teased him. The taunts and name-calling troubled young Rulon, but he never became angry or resentful. He could have withdrawn and become bitter. Like so many others, he could have counted all the things that were going wrong and simply given up.

Instead, he used the insults as motivation. He determined he would use his size to his advantage. He would make something of himself.

"I would go out, as a kid," Rulon said, "and I could barely pick up a bale of hay. By the time my senior year came around, I was grabbing four bales of hay at a time, each 100 pounds. Just grabbing them and walking with them and seeing how physically strong I could be" (in Alan Robinson, "Wrestlers Magic Moment," Associated Press, Sydney, Australia, 28 September 2000 [at www.abcnews.go.com/sections/sports/DailyNews/oly_gardner_000928.html]).

He milked cows twice a day, often in subzero temperatures. He lifted frozen bales of hay to feed the cows. At times he would carry a newborn calf into the safety of a warm barn. He got up early in the morning, did his chores, then went to school. After school he either went to wrestling or football practice, then back to the farm to do more chores.

Rulon found that his size wasnt a disadvantage for him as an athlete - in fact, it was an asset. Wrestling particularly came easy to him, and he became the Wyoming state champion. After graduating from high school he decided that perhaps he might be good enough to compete in the Olympic games.

In Atlanta in 1996, due to a miscommunication, he arrived at the weigh-in 22 seconds too late and missed his chance to compete. Again Rulon could have despaired. He could have cursed his luck. He could have become embittered and resentful.

But do you know what he did? He worked harder. Instead of burying himself in self-pity, he began speaking at youth firesides about his experience. "I missed the Olympic games by 22 seconds," he told his eager listeners. "Dont you let anything keep you from your goals."

After four years of hard work, Rulon Gardner wanted to compete in the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney, Australia. The only trouble was, he couldnt afford the trip. Thats when the members of his hometown rallied to his side. They held bake sales and potluck dinners and raised enough money to allow Rulon and his family to make the trip to Sydney.

This time he did not miss the weigh-in. He advanced through the preliminary rounds until he reached the final obstacle to his gaining a gold medal.

That obstacle was a man the world called the Siberian Bear, Alexander Karelin. This Russian bear is considered by most as the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler in the history of the sport. Not only had he not lost a single match in 13 years, but no one had scored a point on him in more than a decade. Karelin had won the gold medal in three previous Olympic Games and was the heavy favorite to win an unprecedented fourth gold medal.

But at the end of the gold-medal match, it was the farm boy from Afton, Wyoming, who stood triumphant in what many consider the greatest upset of the summer Olympic games.

"The reason I think I won," Rulon said, "is because I work harder than anyone else, train harder. And every day I live my life, I do everything I need to do to put my life in order" (in Alan Robinson, Associated Press).

Waving an American flag, a grateful Rulon Gardner thanked his family, his God, and his hometown of Afton, Wyoming, for their helping to make the moment possible.

Winning the gold medal in such a stunning way made Rulon an instant celebrity. Sometimes this sort of attention changes people. Sometimes people become more calloused. Sometimes they forget those they owe the most to. But not Rulon Gardner.

Recently, while a guest on an evening talk show, the host invited Rulon to watch some highlights from his Olympic victory. Without warning, the picture changed to a live shot from Afton, Wyoming. It seemed that the entire population of the town had assembled in the high school gymnasium. They cheered and shouted and held up signs that said, "Rulons got milk!" and "My uncle rocks!"

As this man - one of the strongest men in the world - looked into the television monitor at the faces of the people he loved, tears of gratitude came to his eyes.

In a letter written to his stake president, Rulon Gardner said:

&lt;i&gt;The Lord has given me the chance to work for all my dreams. I feel the Church has helped me to focus and live my life in the ways that have helped me to train and become an Olympic champ. . . . I am blessed . . . to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/i&gt; [Letter to President Val J. Call, Afton Wyoming Stake, 20 October 2000]

Rulon Gardner knows what it means to be grateful.

Gratitude turns a meal into a feast and drudgery into delight. It softens our grief and heightens our pleasure. It turns the simple and common into the memorable and transcendent. It forges bonds of love and fosters loyalty and admiration.

Living in thanksgiving daily is a habit that will enrich our lives and the lives of those we love. But how do we make this part of who we are? May I suggest three things that will help as we strive to live in thanksgiving daily?

&lt;b&gt;First, we must open our eyes.&lt;/b&gt;

I agree with Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote, "The man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life" (&lt;i&gt;Quotationary,&lt;/i&gt; electronic quotation dictionary). Unfortunately, because the beauties of life are so abundant, sometimes we take them for granted.

Our minds have a marvelous capacity to notice the unusual. However, the opposite is true as well: The more often we see the things around us - even the beautiful and wonderful things - the more they become invisible to us.

That is why we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds - even those we love.

Because we see things so often, we see them less and less.

Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, have a way of opening their eyes and seeing the wonders and beauties of this world as though seeing them for the first time.

I encourage you to look around you. Notice the people you care about. Notice the beauties of this campus. Notice the fragrance of the flowers and the song of the birds. Notice and give thanks for the blue of the sky, the red of the leaves, and the white of the clouds. Enjoy every sight, every smell, every taste, every sound.

When we open our eyes and give thanks for the bountiful beauty of this life, we live in thanksgiving daily.

&lt;b&gt;The second thing we can do is open our hearts.&lt;/b&gt;

We must let go of the negative emotions that bind our hearts and instead fill our souls with love, faith, and thanksgiving.

Anger, resentment, and bitterness stunt our spiritual growth. Would you bathe in impure water? Then why do we bathe our spirits with negative and bitter thoughts and feelings?

You can cleanse your heart. You dont have to harbor thoughts and feelings that drag you down and destroy your spirit.

You can repent of uncleanliness. That is the miracle of Christs atoning sacrifice. You can become clean. You can cleanse your heart of impurity.

Begin the process today. Repent of those things you should repent of. Drink deeply of the living waters of the gospel. These latter days are a time of great spiritual thirst. Many in the world are searching, often intensely, for a source of refreshment that will quench their yearning for meaning and direction in their lives. The Lord provides the living water that can quench the burning thirst of those whose lives are parched by a drought of truth.

Pray with all your heart. Consider the love your Heavenly Father has for all His children. Open your hearts to His cleansing word. Feast on the words of holy writ. Cherish the messages of modern-day prophets and apostles. Forgive others who have offended you. Dont waste another moment feeling self-pity. Every day drain from your heart the feelings of resentment, rage, and defeat that do nothing but discourage and destroy. Fill your heart with those things that ennoble, encourage, and inspire.

The great Book of Mormon prophet Nephi certainly had reason to be resentful. Hated by his brothers, bound and beaten and nearly murdered, he had plenty to be bitter about. After his father died, Nephi must have felt completely alone. He surely felt threatened. He surely felt discouraged. He surely felt troubled. But when it came time for him to communicate his feelings, what did he write?

&lt;i&gt;Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 4:16]

Yes, his path had been difficult. Yes, his heart groaned because of mistakes he had made, but he did not allow himself to linger in negativity. Instead, he told himself:

&lt;i&gt;Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 4:2830]

&lt;b&gt;The third thing we can do to live in thanksgiving daily is open our arms.&lt;/b&gt;

One of the best ways we show our gratitude is by blessing the lives of those around us. The great King Benjamin taught his people:

&lt;i&gt;If you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice . . .  - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . If ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 2:2021]

And how do we render thanks unto God? King Benjamin told us that as well:

&lt;i&gt;And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 2:17]

We can live in thanksgiving daily by opening our arms to those around us. When was the last time you told someone you love how much they mean to you? When was the last time you expressed your gratitude to someone who has always been there for you, someone who has sacrificed for you, someone whose heart has always been filled with hopes and dreams for you?

When was the last time you unselfishly reached out to help another in need? Every time we cheer anothers heart, every time we ease anothers burden, every time we lift a weary hand, we show our gratitude to that God to whom we owe all that we have and all that we are.

Not long ago a mother and father from the Republic of Georgia faced a terrifying reality. The doctors told them their baby had a heart condition, and unless he had surgery he would die. Because they did not have adequate facilities in Georgia, the mother and father walked across their country and all the way to Yerevan, Armenia, seeking medical help.

The Armenian doctors examined the child and agreed that the baby needed heart surgery. They knew how to perform the surgery and they had the necessary facilities, but they couldnt perform the operation because they didnt have the right tubing. As much as they wanted to help, there was nothing they could do. They told the couple to take their baby home to die.

As you know, the Church - through its Humanitarian Service arm - sends millions of pounds of food, clothing, and medical and educational materials throughout the world each year. As it so happened, Elder and Sister Sangster were serving a humanitarian mission in Armenia, and they had just received a container of medical supplies.

You may have already guessed that tucked away in this container of medical supplies was a box of precisely the kind of tubing needed for this childs operation.

When the doctors discovered the tubing, they rushed the baby into surgery and performed the operation.

Thats a wonderful story and one that repeats itself daily as a result of the tremendous humanitarian help that is given to many nations in the world. The great welfare effort given by the Church benefits members and nonmembers during times of need. It reaches out to care for others. But what happened later makes it an even better story. One day, soon after the operation, Elder and Sister Sangster heard a knock at their door. When they opened it, this loving mother and father fell to their knees and wept as they thanked the Sangsters and their church for supplying the precious tubing that had saved the life of their child.

The blessings that come from opening our arms to others are among the choicest this earth has to offer.

As we strive to open our eyes, hearts, and arms, our step will become a little lighter, our smile will become a little brighter, and the darkness that sometimes broods over our lives will become a little whiter. Dont be discouraged if you havent been an especially grateful person. Rejoice and think of what an impression you will make on those who thought they knew you. Think of how delightfully surprised they will be.

Be grateful. Every day is a new canvas - a new opportunity. Our beloved President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:

&lt;i&gt;My plea is that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting that as we go through life, we "accentuate the positive." I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment and endorse virtue and effort.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Standing for Something&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Times Books, 2000), 101]

Choice blessings await those who live in thanksgiving daily. "He who receiveth all things with thankfulness," the Lord has promised, "shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more" (D&amp;amp;C 78:19).

Dont wait to start. Open your eyes, open your hearts, and open your arms. I promise that as you do so, you will feel greater joy and happiness. Your life will have a new level of meaning. You will forge relationships that will transcend this life and endure through the eternities.

My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be here with you. I am grateful for this experience of mortality. I am grateful for the gospel and for the life and testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am grateful for my wonderful wife, my dear children and grandchildren. I am grateful for the support and love shown to me by countless friends and members of the Church throughout the world. I am grateful for life and even more grateful for the glorious promise of eternal life to come.

Not everyone can be a star quarterback; not everyone can be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company; not everyone can win a gold medal at the Olympics; but everyone - &lt;i&gt;everyone - &lt;/i&gt;can live in thanksgiving daily.

As a special witness, I bear solemn testimony that Jesus is the living Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. He asks that we believe in Him, that we learn of Him, that we strive to follow His teachings, and that we adhere to the teachings of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. He inspires him in the direction needed for this life and life eternal.

May we follow Him in all we do is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I love to be among the youth of the Church. I love your energy, your optimism, your faith. I have heard others say they always feel younger when they spend time with young people. This has always been my experience.</p>
<p>It is good to be here today. I felt a certain thrill as I watched you enter this great Marriott Center. I noticed the beautiful smiling faces, the well-kept hair, the appropriate dress. I thank you for being here today.</p>
<p>Think for a moment, if you will, of someone you know who is truly happy. Weve all met those who seem to radiate happiness. They seem to smile more than others, they laugh more than others - just being around them makes us happier as well.</p>
<p>Now think of someone you know who isnt happy at all. Perhaps they seem 10 years older than they are, drained of energy - perhaps they are angry or bitter or depressed.</p>
<p>What is the difference between them? What are the characteristics that differentiate the happy from the miserable? Is there something that unhappy people can do to be happier? I believe there is.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story to illustrate this observation.</p>
<p>A long time ago in a faraway village lived a man who everyone did their very best to avoid. He was the type of person who believed that there was only one competent person in the world, and that one person was himself. Consequently he was never satisfied with anything. His shoes never fit right. His shirt never felt comfortable. When his food wasnt too cold, it was too salty, and when it wasnt too hot, it was too bland.</p>
<p>If a field wasnt sowed by himself, it was not sowed well. If he didnt close the door, the door was not closed properly.</p>
<p>In short, he made a career of frowning, lecturing, criticizing, and mumbling about the incompetencies of every other person in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the man was married, which made matters all the worse. No matter what his wife did, in his eyes it was wrong. No matter what the unfortunate woman cooked, sewed, or cleaned, or even when she milked the cow, it was never satisfactory, and he let her know it.</p>
<p>She tried very hard to be a good wife, but it seemed the harder she tried the less she pleased him. Finally, one evening she could take no more.</p>
<p>"Ill tell you what well do," she told him. "Tomorrow I will do your chores and you will do mine."</p>
<p>"But you cant do my chores," the man replied. "You dont know the first thing about sowing, hoeing, and irrigating."</p>
<p>But the woman was adamant. And on top of that, she was filled with a righteous anger that frankly astonished and frightened the man to the point where he didnt dare disagree.</p>
<p>So the next morning the wife went off to the fields and the man began the domestic chores. After thinking about it, he had actually convinced himself he was looking forward to it. Once and for all, he would demonstrate to his wife how things should be done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not everything went according to plan. In fact, nearly everything the man touched turned into disaster. He spilled the milk, let the pig get into the house, lost the cow, burned the dinner, and ultimately set the house on fire, narrowly escaping with his own life.</p>
<p>When his wife returned, she discovered her husband sitting on a pile of ashes, smoke still rising from his clothes. But the woman wasnt the type to rub things in. She helped him up, wiped the soot from his beard, fixed him a little something to eat, and then prepared a bed of straw for them to sleep on.</p>
<p>From that day forward, the man never complained about anyone or anything else for as long as he lived.</p>
<p>What do you suppose this story teaches us?</p>
<p>For one thing, it teaches that those who complain make their own and others lives miserable. The story also teaches humility. It reminds us that "pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall" (Proverbs 16:18). It teaches us not to judge others until we walk in their shoes for a while.</p>
<p>In addition, the story illustrates a quality that the Roman orator Cicero claimed was "not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others" (Marcus Tullius Cicero, <i>Pro Plancio,</i> 54 B.C.). It is a quality I have found in every happy person I know. It is a quality that instantly makes a person more likable and more at peace. Where there is an abundance, there is happiness. Where there is an absence, there is often sadness, resentment, and futility.</p>
<p>The virtue I am speaking of is gratitude.</p>
<p>In our story, it was the absence of gratitude that made the man miserable. His inability to appreciate others caused him to be critical of their efforts. Not only did he not empathize with them, he could not allow himself to acknowledge their contributions.</p>
<p>The disasters that confronted him surely made him humble, but, more particularly, they made him appreciate and be grateful for his wife.</p>
<p>Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to know that gratitude is a commandment of the Father. "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;C 59:7), the Lord has commanded in these latter days. Even further, He has admonished that "in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments" (D&amp;C 59:21).</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon we learn that we should "live in thanksgiving daily" (Alma 34:38). Isnt that a wonderful thought? To live in thanksgiving daily? Can you imagine how your life would improve if you lived in thanksgiving daily? Can you imagine how your life would improve if others did the same? Do you think the world would be a happier place? Less stressful? Less angry? More spiritual?</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith proclaimed:</p>
<p><i>The grateful man sees so much in the world to be thankful for, and with him the good outweighs the evil. Love overpowers jealousy, and light drives darkness out of his life. Pride destroys our gratitude and sets up selfishness in its place. How much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul, and how careful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude toward God and man!</i> [<i>GD,</i> 263]</p>
<p>A few minutes ago I asked you to think of someone you knew who was truly happy. Think of the person again, if you will, and grade on this principle: Does he or she live in thanksgiving daily?</p>
<p>Now think of someone you know who is unhappy or resentful. Does this person live in thanksgiving daily?</p>
<p>It is difficult to even imagine a resentful person who is grateful or a grateful person who is resentful. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:</p>
<p><i>Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. It expresses itself in ugly egotism and frequently in wanton mischief. . . .</i><i></i></p>
<p><i>Where there is appreciation, there is courtesy, there is concern for the rights and property of others. Without it, there is arrogance and evil.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1964, 117]</p>
<p>I believe that many people are unhappy because they have not learned to be grateful. Some carry the burden of bitterness and resentfulness for many years. Some pass their days as though suffering a deep sadness they cannot name. Others are unhappy because life didnt turn out the way they thought it would.</p>
<p>"If only I had money," some might say to themselves, "then I could be happy."</p>
<p>"If only I were better looking."</p>
<p>"If only I were smarter."</p>
<p>"If only I had a new car, a college degree, a job, a wife, hair that wasnt so frizzy." (Or, in my case, if only I had more hair or I was 12 inches taller.)</p>
<p>If we only look around us, there are a thousand reasons for us not to be happy, and it is simplicity itself to blame our unhappiness on the things we lack in life. It doesnt take any talent at all to find them. The problem is, the more we focus on the things we dont have, the unhappier and more resentful we become.</p>
<p>Over the course of my years, I have met thousands of people. I have dined with the prosperous as well as the poverty-stricken. I have conversed with the mighty and with the meek. I have walked with the famous and the feeble. I have run with outstanding athletes and those who are not athletically inclined.</p>
<p>One thing I can tell you with certainty is this: You cannot predict happiness by the amount of money, fame, or power a person has. External conditions do not necessarily make a person happy. The brethren who have had assignments in Africa report that despite the abject poverty, the people are very happy. The fact is that the external things so valued by the world are often the cause of a great deal of misery in the world.</p>
<p>Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, are usually among the worlds happiest people. And they make others happy as well.</p>
<p>Years ago Elder J. Golden Kimball was traveling with one of the presiding brethren in southern Utah. In those days meetings often didnt have a time limit; they went on as long as the speaker wanted to speak. For those of you looking for something to be grateful for, perhaps Ive just given you one idea.</p>
<p>One fast Sunday they had been preaching nearly all day. Everyone was hungry, especially Elder Kimball, who felt that he "was pretty nearly dead."</p>
<p>Finally, at about four oclock in the afternoon, the presiding apostle turned and said, "Now, Brother Kimball, get up and tell them about the <i>Era."</i></p>
<p>The <i>Era</i> magazine had just been launched, and the Brethren wanted to encourage subscriptions. Elder Kimball approached the pulpit and then, after a short pause, said, "All you men that will take the <i>Era</i> if we will let you go home, raise your right hand." There was not a single man who did not raise his hand that day and subscribe to the <i>Era.</i> (In J. Golden Kimball, <i>CR,</i> April 1932, 78.)</p>
<p>You see, the power of gratitude is immense.</p>
<p>Rulon Gardner grew up in the small town of Afton, Wyoming. He is one of nine children. His mother and father are faithful members of the Church and instilled proper values in their children.</p>
<p>But because Rulon was so large, his classmates teased him. The taunts and name-calling troubled young Rulon, but he never became angry or resentful. He could have withdrawn and become bitter. Like so many others, he could have counted all the things that were going wrong and simply given up.</p>
<p>Instead, he used the insults as motivation. He determined he would use his size to his advantage. He would make something of himself.</p>
<p>"I would go out, as a kid," Rulon said, "and I could barely pick up a bale of hay. By the time my senior year came around, I was grabbing four bales of hay at a time, each 100 pounds. Just grabbing them and walking with them and seeing how physically strong I could be" (in Alan Robinson, "Wrestlers Magic Moment," Associated Press, Sydney, Australia, 28 September 2000 [at www.abcnews.go.com/sections/sports/DailyNews/oly_gardner_000928.html]).</p>
<p>He milked cows twice a day, often in subzero temperatures. He lifted frozen bales of hay to feed the cows. At times he would carry a newborn calf into the safety of a warm barn. He got up early in the morning, did his chores, then went to school. After school he either went to wrestling or football practice, then back to the farm to do more chores.</p>
<p>Rulon found that his size wasnt a disadvantage for him as an athlete - in fact, it was an asset. Wrestling particularly came easy to him, and he became the Wyoming state champion. After graduating from high school he decided that perhaps he might be good enough to compete in the Olympic games.</p>
<p>In Atlanta in 1996, due to a miscommunication, he arrived at the weigh-in 22 seconds too late and missed his chance to compete. Again Rulon could have despaired. He could have cursed his luck. He could have become embittered and resentful.</p>
<p>But do you know what he did? He worked harder. Instead of burying himself in self-pity, he began speaking at youth firesides about his experience. "I missed the Olympic games by 22 seconds," he told his eager listeners. "Dont you let anything keep you from your goals."</p>
<p>After four years of hard work, Rulon Gardner wanted to compete in the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney, Australia. The only trouble was, he couldnt afford the trip. Thats when the members of his hometown rallied to his side. They held bake sales and potluck dinners and raised enough money to allow Rulon and his family to make the trip to Sydney.</p>
<p>This time he did not miss the weigh-in. He advanced through the preliminary rounds until he reached the final obstacle to his gaining a gold medal.</p>
<p>That obstacle was a man the world called the Siberian Bear, Alexander Karelin. This Russian bear is considered by most as the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler in the history of the sport. Not only had he not lost a single match in 13 years, but no one had scored a point on him in more than a decade. Karelin had won the gold medal in three previous Olympic Games and was the heavy favorite to win an unprecedented fourth gold medal.</p>
<p>But at the end of the gold-medal match, it was the farm boy from Afton, Wyoming, who stood triumphant in what many consider the greatest upset of the summer Olympic games.</p>
<p>"The reason I think I won," Rulon said, "is because I work harder than anyone else, train harder. And every day I live my life, I do everything I need to do to put my life in order" (in Alan Robinson, Associated Press).</p>
<p>Waving an American flag, a grateful Rulon Gardner thanked his family, his God, and his hometown of Afton, Wyoming, for their helping to make the moment possible.</p>
<p>Winning the gold medal in such a stunning way made Rulon an instant celebrity. Sometimes this sort of attention changes people. Sometimes people become more calloused. Sometimes they forget those they owe the most to. But not Rulon Gardner.</p>
<p>Recently, while a guest on an evening talk show, the host invited Rulon to watch some highlights from his Olympic victory. Without warning, the picture changed to a live shot from Afton, Wyoming. It seemed that the entire population of the town had assembled in the high school gymnasium. They cheered and shouted and held up signs that said, "Rulons got milk!" and "My uncle rocks!"</p>
<p>As this man - one of the strongest men in the world - looked into the television monitor at the faces of the people he loved, tears of gratitude came to his eyes.</p>
<p>In a letter written to his stake president, Rulon Gardner said:</p>
<p><i>The Lord has given me the chance to work for all my dreams. I feel the Church has helped me to focus and live my life in the ways that have helped me to train and become an Olympic champ. . . . I am blessed . . . to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i> [Letter to President Val J. Call, Afton Wyoming Stake, 20 October 2000]</p>
<p>Rulon Gardner knows what it means to be grateful.</p>
<p>Gratitude turns a meal into a feast and drudgery into delight. It softens our grief and heightens our pleasure. It turns the simple and common into the memorable and transcendent. It forges bonds of love and fosters loyalty and admiration.</p>
<p>Living in thanksgiving daily is a habit that will enrich our lives and the lives of those we love. But how do we make this part of who we are? May I suggest three things that will help as we strive to live in thanksgiving daily?</p>
<p><b>First, we must open our eyes.</b></p>
<p>I agree with Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote, "The man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life" (<i>Quotationary,</i> electronic quotation dictionary). Unfortunately, because the beauties of life are so abundant, sometimes we take them for granted.</p>
<p>Our minds have a marvelous capacity to notice the unusual. However, the opposite is true as well: The more often we see the things around us - even the beautiful and wonderful things - the more they become invisible to us.</p>
<p>That is why we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds - even those we love.</p>
<p>Because we see things so often, we see them less and less.</p>
<p>Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, have a way of opening their eyes and seeing the wonders and beauties of this world as though seeing them for the first time.</p>
<p>I encourage you to look around you. Notice the people you care about. Notice the beauties of this campus. Notice the fragrance of the flowers and the song of the birds. Notice and give thanks for the blue of the sky, the red of the leaves, and the white of the clouds. Enjoy every sight, every smell, every taste, every sound.</p>
<p>When we open our eyes and give thanks for the bountiful beauty of this life, we live in thanksgiving daily.</p>
<p><b>The second thing we can do is open our hearts.</b></p>
<p>We must let go of the negative emotions that bind our hearts and instead fill our souls with love, faith, and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Anger, resentment, and bitterness stunt our spiritual growth. Would you bathe in impure water? Then why do we bathe our spirits with negative and bitter thoughts and feelings?</p>
<p>You can cleanse your heart. You dont have to harbor thoughts and feelings that drag you down and destroy your spirit.</p>
<p>You can repent of uncleanliness. That is the miracle of Christs atoning sacrifice. You can become clean. You can cleanse your heart of impurity.</p>
<p>Begin the process today. Repent of those things you should repent of. Drink deeply of the living waters of the gospel. These latter days are a time of great spiritual thirst. Many in the world are searching, often intensely, for a source of refreshment that will quench their yearning for meaning and direction in their lives. The Lord provides the living water that can quench the burning thirst of those whose lives are parched by a drought of truth.</p>
<p>Pray with all your heart. Consider the love your Heavenly Father has for all His children. Open your hearts to His cleansing word. Feast on the words of holy writ. Cherish the messages of modern-day prophets and apostles. Forgive others who have offended you. Dont waste another moment feeling self-pity. Every day drain from your heart the feelings of resentment, rage, and defeat that do nothing but discourage and destroy. Fill your heart with those things that ennoble, encourage, and inspire.</p>
<p>The great Book of Mormon prophet Nephi certainly had reason to be resentful. Hated by his brothers, bound and beaten and nearly murdered, he had plenty to be bitter about. After his father died, Nephi must have felt completely alone. He surely felt threatened. He surely felt discouraged. He surely felt troubled. But when it came time for him to communicate his feelings, what did he write?</p>
<p><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.</i> [2 Nephi 4:16]</p>
<p>Yes, his path had been difficult. Yes, his heart groaned because of mistakes he had made, but he did not allow himself to linger in negativity. Instead, he told himself:</p>
<p><i>Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.</i></p>
<p><i>Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.</i></p>
<p><i>Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee.</i> [2 Nephi 4:2830]</p>
<p><b>The third thing we can do to live in thanksgiving daily is open our arms.</b></p>
<p>One of the best ways we show our gratitude is by blessing the lives of those around us. The great King Benjamin taught his people:</p>
<p><i>If you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice . . .  - </i></p>
<p><i>. . . If ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i> [Mosiah 2:2021]</p>
<p>And how do we render thanks unto God? King Benjamin told us that as well:</p>
<p><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i> [Mosiah 2:17]</p>
<p>We can live in thanksgiving daily by opening our arms to those around us. When was the last time you told someone you love how much they mean to you? When was the last time you expressed your gratitude to someone who has always been there for you, someone who has sacrificed for you, someone whose heart has always been filled with hopes and dreams for you?</p>
<p>When was the last time you unselfishly reached out to help another in need? Every time we cheer anothers heart, every time we ease anothers burden, every time we lift a weary hand, we show our gratitude to that God to whom we owe all that we have and all that we are.</p>
<p>Not long ago a mother and father from the Republic of Georgia faced a terrifying reality. The doctors told them their baby had a heart condition, and unless he had surgery he would die. Because they did not have adequate facilities in Georgia, the mother and father walked across their country and all the way to Yerevan, Armenia, seeking medical help.</p>
<p>The Armenian doctors examined the child and agreed that the baby needed heart surgery. They knew how to perform the surgery and they had the necessary facilities, but they couldnt perform the operation because they didnt have the right tubing. As much as they wanted to help, there was nothing they could do. They told the couple to take their baby home to die.</p>
<p>As you know, the Church - through its Humanitarian Service arm - sends millions of pounds of food, clothing, and medical and educational materials throughout the world each year. As it so happened, Elder and Sister Sangster were serving a humanitarian mission in Armenia, and they had just received a container of medical supplies.</p>
<p>You may have already guessed that tucked away in this container of medical supplies was a box of precisely the kind of tubing needed for this childs operation.</p>
<p>When the doctors discovered the tubing, they rushed the baby into surgery and performed the operation.</p>
<p>Thats a wonderful story and one that repeats itself daily as a result of the tremendous humanitarian help that is given to many nations in the world. The great welfare effort given by the Church benefits members and nonmembers during times of need. It reaches out to care for others. But what happened later makes it an even better story. One day, soon after the operation, Elder and Sister Sangster heard a knock at their door. When they opened it, this loving mother and father fell to their knees and wept as they thanked the Sangsters and their church for supplying the precious tubing that had saved the life of their child.</p>
<p>The blessings that come from opening our arms to others are among the choicest this earth has to offer.</p>
<p>As we strive to open our eyes, hearts, and arms, our step will become a little lighter, our smile will become a little brighter, and the darkness that sometimes broods over our lives will become a little whiter. Dont be discouraged if you havent been an especially grateful person. Rejoice and think of what an impression you will make on those who thought they knew you. Think of how delightfully surprised they will be.</p>
<p>Be grateful. Every day is a new canvas - a new opportunity. Our beloved President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:</p>
<p><i>My plea is that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting that as we go through life, we "accentuate the positive." I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment and endorse virtue and effort.</i> [<i>Standing for Something</i> (New York: Times Books, 2000), 101]</p>
<p>Choice blessings await those who live in thanksgiving daily. "He who receiveth all things with thankfulness," the Lord has promised, "shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more" (D&amp;C 78:19).</p>
<p>Dont wait to start. Open your eyes, open your hearts, and open your arms. I promise that as you do so, you will feel greater joy and happiness. Your life will have a new level of meaning. You will forge relationships that will transcend this life and endure through the eternities.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be here with you. I am grateful for this experience of mortality. I am grateful for the gospel and for the life and testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am grateful for my wonderful wife, my dear children and grandchildren. I am grateful for the support and love shown to me by countless friends and members of the Church throughout the world. I am grateful for life and even more grateful for the glorious promise of eternal life to come.</p>
<p>Not everyone can be a star quarterback; not everyone can be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company; not everyone can win a gold medal at the Olympics; but everyone - <i>everyone - </i>can live in thanksgiving daily.</p>
<p>As a special witness, I bear solemn testimony that Jesus is the living Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. He asks that we believe in Him, that we learn of Him, that we strive to follow His teachings, and that we adhere to the teachings of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. He inspires him in the direction needed for this life and life eternal.</p>
<p>May we follow Him in all we do is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question "What lack I yet?" and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, "Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer."
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to "be more cheerful" or to "smile more often" or to "count their blessings."
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happiness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing "an unconscious smile."1 I have known people like that - individuals who are continually smiling without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being "temple worthy," what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day - and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet - and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to "thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was "My Heavenly Father Loves Me" (Childrens Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song - "hear[ing] the song of a bird," "look[ing] at the blue . . . sky," having eyes to "see The color of butterfly wings," and feeling "the wind as it rushes by." Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, "What is a SWKT?" I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges - including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. ["Stories of the Century," comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 19992000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lees memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the students tuition. . . .

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn "Count Your Blessings." I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; evry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact - not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: "I can live for two months on a good compliment."3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift - from friends, from family, from God - and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change peoples lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles - 500 of it on foot. Im not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I dont believe Ive ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lords hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries - our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease - we sometimes forget to confess the Lords hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimballs statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Lets take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
