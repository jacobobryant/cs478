  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear fellow students, I am honored to speak to you this summer morning and approach this assignment with a humble heart and pray for the Spirit of the Lord to guide me in the things I say to you.

You have made a very wise choice in determining to further your education; I commend you all for attending this great university. For many of you I am sure it must have been a difficult choice because of attractive alternatives in life or possibly because of the lack of funds. But you chose wisely, and I counsel you to have the courage to continue to pursue your goal, regardless of obstacles that may be placed in your path.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Greatest Teacher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
You have many outstanding teachers in this important university, but today I would like to refer to the greatest teacher of them all, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Jesus did much of his teaching by the use of parables. In teaching in this manner he used familiar illustrations, such as farmers, seeds, sowing weeds and thorns, harvests, shepherds, sheep and wolves, and many other illustrations familiar to those he was teaching.

A beautiful example is the parable of the sower:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, a sower went forth to sow;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Some fell upon the stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.&lt;/i&gt; [Matthew 13:3–8]

This parable given by the Savior provides one of the great lessons of life. We are also told that “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (Galatians 6:7).

In the parable given, the sower had a choice to make—whether to prepare the soil for the seed or take a chance and sow the seed without preparing the ground, hoping that the seed would fall on good ground. He was, however, careless and chose to take a chance, sowing without preparing the soil. Some seeds fell by the wayside and were eaten by the birds. Some fell among thorns and were choked out. He learned that sowing where birds ate and where thorns choked was not profitable. Had he prepared the soil before sowing, he could possibly have reaped one hundredfold. This sower truly witnessed the truth of the statement that “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” The choice he made before sowing commenced determined to a large extent the harvest he was to reap.

Of course, we all have our free agency, and as the poet so ably expressed:

&lt;i&gt;Know this, that ev’ry soul is free&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To choose his life and what he’ll be;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For this eternal truth is giv’n:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That God will force no man to heav’n.&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 240]

Each of us has the opportunity and responsibility of deciding what we will do and what we will be.

Through modern revelation, God’s relationship to man has again been clarified. I ask you to seriously consider the fact that the life of your earthly body is your spirit and that God the Eternal Father is the father of your spirit.

What a tremendous effect this has in the lives of those who accept this doctrine. Our Father in Heaven loves each and every one of us and is interested in our welfare and growth and development. In fact, it is his work and glory “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39).

Again, let me say that we know not only that we have a spark of divinity within us, but that we are actually spirit children of our Heavenly Father and that every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God (see D&amp;amp;C 46:11).

With this relationship, we are thus blessed with many talents and possess great possibilities. The Savior set our greatest goal for us when he said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). To become perfect requires growth and development, and as we contemplate perfection, we recognize that growth is the greatest phenomenon of this existence.

This Church teaches the value and necessity of eternal progression. We progressed in the premortal existence, and it is our responsibility and opportunity to progress in this estate and throughout all eternity. During his earthly ministry the Savior gave two parables dealing with the requirement that we must develop the talents with which we are endowed. These parables are the parable of the entrusted talents and the parable of the pounds.

The talent was an ancient weight and money unit.

The dictionary defines talent as “the abilities, powers, and gifts bestowed upon a man; natural endowments; thought of as a divine trust. A natural capacity or gift.”

The parable of the entrusted talents was given to the Savior’s apostles, and in it the Savior told of a man who was about to leave on a long trip and who, therefore, called his servants together and gave them his goods. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. To each man he gave according to his ability.

While the master was away, the one that received five talents put them to use and made five more talents. The one that received two talents put them to use and made two more. But the one that received the one talent hid it in the ground.

After a period of time, the master returned and asked for an accounting. Unto the servants that had doubled their talents the master said, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord” (Matthew 25:23).

The master called the servant that hid his talent and did not multiply it a slothful servant, and said he would take the one talent from him and give it to the servant that had ten talents.

Whereas, the parable of the entrusted talents was given to his apostles, the parable of the pounds was given to a mixed multitude on the Savior’s last journey from Jericho to Jerusalem (see Luke 19), and although there are some differences in the two parables, in essence they teach the same truths and principles.

From the man endowed with many talents more was expected than from the men with lesser talents, yet all were expected to multiply such talents as they were given. In each parable, although relatively little was expected of the men given one talent or one pound, each failed to use his talent. Good use of the talent on the part of the man given one talent was just as important and necessary as on the part of the men given two and five talents.

In this dispensation the Lord has been equally direct in his charge to his children. He has told us that he has given us many things, “For the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talents, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold” (D&amp;amp;C 82:18).

He has admonished us that “Of him unto whom much is given much is required” (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). He also says,

&lt;i&gt;But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of men. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 60:2–3]

And then we are charged, “Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known” (D&amp;amp;C 60:13). The Savior evidenced little regard for the slothful servant. He expects us to work and to use our initiative. These scriptures clearly emphasize our obligations to use and develop the gifts and talents we have been blessed with—or shall we say to develop the spark of divinity within us? Human experience confirms the soundness of this doctrine.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How To&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
All of us should be concerned about &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to best develop our gifts and talents. First, we should recognize our talents and make up our minds to pay the price necessary to develop them. The price to be paid in developing talents includes among other things faith, study, and persistence.

In developing faith we must never overlook the fact that we are spirit children of God the Eternal Father and that our Father in Heaven will assist us in developing our talents as we do our part. One way in which he will assist us is to open up opportunities for us to use our talents.

Some recognize their talents, but we are told they do not use them because of the fear of men.

Fear destroys faith and deprives us of many blessings. This is clearly brought out in a revelation when the Lord said,

&lt;i&gt;Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 67:3]

We must therefore overcome fear. The Lord has told us that if we are prepared, we shall not fear (see D&amp;amp;C 38:30).

Preparation involves study, and we are also counseled to “seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). President Benson has specifically suggested that we study the Book of Mormon.

Eternal progress involves continual study. Increased learning gives us confidence, and confidence engenders faith, and faith banishes fear. I therefore encourage you to never cease to study—this being an important part of developing your talents. We should appreciate that talents are developed by use, and they will not grow and multiply unless they are used.

This principle was clearly taught in the Savior’s parables. As we develop our talents, we should develop the spirit of sharing or giving, not only with those who are closest to us but with all of God’s children. Remember the words of King Benjamin: “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). The Lord wants us to enjoy our talents, but he also expects us to use them for the enjoyment and benefit of others and to build the kingdom of God.

Today we hear much about the need of challenges for the youth as well as for our senior citizens. Despite the fact that we are living in a troublesome period, we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, a most wonderful period in the history of the world—yes, in a new era of growth and development. Opportunities today, for young and old, exceed those of any other age.

We should be grateful to live at this particular time when the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the people of the earth so abundantly. One of the important and distinguishing features of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that its affairs are administered by the lay members of the Church rather than by paid clergy.

I have been told by some of my nonmember friends that the thing about the Church that has impressed them the most is that it gives every person a chance to serve regardless of his age. How true this is.

The Church in reality is a vehicle for the growth and development of God’s children. The priesthood quorums, Primary, Young Women, Sunday School, Relief Society, and other Church organizations in their various activities and programs, all contribute to the development of their members’ talents and provide opportunities for them to be shared with others.

Thus, as stated, exciting and challenging leadership opportunities are afforded men, women, and children of all ages to become involved in interesting and worthwhile projects. This is not only a great opportunity, but likewise a responsibility for Church members because the future growth of the Church is dependent upon the development of leaders—leaders for the general Church administration as well as for missions, stakes, wards, priesthood quorums, auxiliaries, and other Church organizations and activities.

Talents may be developed in many areas of teaching, speaking, missionary work, music, drama, dancing, athletics of many kinds, Scout work, genealogical work, temple work, welfare programs, compassionate service, and many other fields that might be mentioned—all contributing to the development of talents and leadership.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do You Feel Inadequate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Frequently, when a person is asked to accept a position in the Church he is prone to say, “Oh, I can’t do that. I haven’t as much experience or education as someone else who may have been serving.” But with our faith, study, work, and prayer, the Lord will make it possible for us to accomplish things that seem impossible.

Our measuring stick should not be someone else’s accomplishments but our own capabilities. Are we truly doing our best? Are we anxious to develop our talents to the greatest degree and use them in building the kingdom of God? When a person does this he develops his talents, is happy, and grows in knowledge and spirit. The Lord will make you equal to every task you are called upon to perform as you do your part.

President Heber J. Grant used to frequently use this quote: “That which we try to do, and persist in doing, becomes easy to do, not because its nature is changed, but because our power to do is developed” (Josiah Gilbert Holland [Timothy Titcomb, pseud.], &lt;i&gt;Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs&lt;/i&gt; [New York: Charles Scribner, 1859], 291). President Grant exemplified this principle throughout his entire life, and his persistence no doubt played a great part in many of his accomplishments.

As a young man I was thrilled and inspired by the stories of this great Church leader—how, even though seemingly lacking in some talents, through determination and persistence he developed outstanding skill. As a boy he was a very poor penman, and his teacher criticized his writing, saying it was almost impossible to read. This was a challenge to President Grant, and he practiced writing hours upon hours until he finally became an expert penman.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnify Each Talent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Recently I listened to a new convert tell in a meeting how he had three Church assignments. First, he put the flag up each day in front of the chapel. He then briefly explained the meaning of the flag to him. Second, he kept the hymnbooks in repair. Here he mentioned how these hymns were so inspiring and contained much doctrine and prophesy. He briefly referred to the hymn “O, My Father” and its reference to a Mother in Heaven. Third, he was a home teacher and explained what this service can mean to both the teacher as well as to the person being visited and taught.

This man enjoyed and appreciated these three opportunities to serve and was blessing the lives of others as well as magnifying his talents.

Sometimes we hear of someone thinking his or her assignment is not very important. This reminds me of a young man who gave his intended wife a diamond engagement ring. In doing so, he remarked, “It isn’t very big.” Whereupon she replied, “It’s as big as we make it.” There are no unimportant callings in the Church.

This is a time of preparation for some other assignment and responsibility. We will be given increased opportunities and responsibilities as we serve with an eye single to the glory of God. We will be magnified and our talents will be increased—yes, even a hundredfold (see D&amp;amp;C 82:18). As we develop our talents and share them in serving our fellowmen, we will find great peace, happiness, joy, and contentment, as well as growth and development.

As previously stated, we are living in a troublesome period, but we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, when, in my opinion, the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out on the face of the earth more today than ever before.

I am grateful that my spirit was reserved to come to this earth at this time—in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This dispensation was opened by one of the greatest manifestations of the Godhead ever made to man when God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to the boy Joseph Smith. Through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness was restored, the power to act in the name of God was restored, and God’s church was reestablished upon the earth with apostles and prophets guiding and directing the affairs of the kingdom of God on the earth today.

I bear you my witness that our beloved prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, is guiding this Church under the direction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Most of you have this same testimony. What a tremendous effect this knowledge has in the lives of those who accept his doctrine. We know that our Father in Heaven loves us and is interested in our welfare, growth, and development. Yes, he has said, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39).

May we live the gospel principles and follow the counsel of our leaders, and may the choice blessings of our Father in Heaven be with you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My dear fellow students, I am honored to speak to you this summer morning and approach this assignment with a humble heart and pray for the Spirit of the Lord to guide me in the things I say to you.</p>
<p>You have made a very wise choice in determining to further your education; I commend you all for attending this great university. For many of you I am sure it must have been a difficult choice because of attractive alternatives in life or possibly because of the lack of funds. But you chose wisely, and I counsel you to have the courage to continue to pursue your goal, regardless of obstacles that may be placed in your path.</p>
<h2><b>The Greatest Teacher</b></h2>
<p>You have many outstanding teachers in this important university, but today I would like to refer to the greatest teacher of them all, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Jesus did much of his teaching by the use of parables. In teaching in this manner he used familiar illustrations, such as farmers, seeds, sowing weeds and thorns, harvests, shepherds, sheep and wolves, and many other illustrations familiar to those he was teaching.</p>
<p>A beautiful example is the parable of the sower:</p>
<p><i>Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</i></p>
<p><i>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</i></p>
<p><i>Some fell upon the stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</i></p>
<p><i>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</i></p>
<p><i>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</i></p>
<p><i>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</i> [Matthew 13:3–8]</p>
<p>This parable given by the Savior provides one of the great lessons of life. We are also told that “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (Galatians 6:7).</p>
<p>In the parable given, the sower had a choice to make—whether to prepare the soil for the seed or take a chance and sow the seed without preparing the ground, hoping that the seed would fall on good ground. He was, however, careless and chose to take a chance, sowing without preparing the soil. Some seeds fell by the wayside and were eaten by the birds. Some fell among thorns and were choked out. He learned that sowing where birds ate and where thorns choked was not profitable. Had he prepared the soil before sowing, he could possibly have reaped one hundredfold. This sower truly witnessed the truth of the statement that “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” The choice he made before sowing commenced determined to a large extent the harvest he was to reap.</p>
<p>Of course, we all have our free agency, and as the poet so ably expressed:</p>
<p><i>Know this, that ev’ry soul is free</i><br />
<i>To choose his life and what he’ll be;</i><br />
<i>For this eternal truth is giv’n:</i><br />
<i>That God will force no man to heav’n.</i><br />
[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 240]</p>
<p>Each of us has the opportunity and responsibility of deciding what we will do and what we will be.</p>
<p>Through modern revelation, God’s relationship to man has again been clarified. I ask you to seriously consider the fact that the life of your earthly body is your spirit and that God the Eternal Father is the father of your spirit.</p>
<p>What a tremendous effect this has in the lives of those who accept this doctrine. Our Father in Heaven loves each and every one of us and is interested in our welfare and growth and development. In fact, it is his work and glory “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39).</p>
<p>Again, let me say that we know not only that we have a spark of divinity within us, but that we are actually spirit children of our Heavenly Father and that every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God (see D&amp;C 46:11).</p>
<p>With this relationship, we are thus blessed with many talents and possess great possibilities. The Savior set our greatest goal for us when he said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). To become perfect requires growth and development, and as we contemplate perfection, we recognize that growth is the greatest phenomenon of this existence.</p>
<p>This Church teaches the value and necessity of eternal progression. We progressed in the premortal existence, and it is our responsibility and opportunity to progress in this estate and throughout all eternity. During his earthly ministry the Savior gave two parables dealing with the requirement that we must develop the talents with which we are endowed. These parables are the parable of the entrusted talents and the parable of the pounds.</p>
<p>The talent was an ancient weight and money unit.</p>
<p>The dictionary defines talent as “the abilities, powers, and gifts bestowed upon a man; natural endowments; thought of as a divine trust. A natural capacity or gift.”</p>
<p>The parable of the entrusted talents was given to the Savior’s apostles, and in it the Savior told of a man who was about to leave on a long trip and who, therefore, called his servants together and gave them his goods. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. To each man he gave according to his ability.</p>
<p>While the master was away, the one that received five talents put them to use and made five more talents. The one that received two talents put them to use and made two more. But the one that received the one talent hid it in the ground.</p>
<p>After a period of time, the master returned and asked for an accounting. Unto the servants that had doubled their talents the master said, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord” (Matthew 25:23).</p>
<p>The master called the servant that hid his talent and did not multiply it a slothful servant, and said he would take the one talent from him and give it to the servant that had ten talents.</p>
<p>Whereas, the parable of the entrusted talents was given to his apostles, the parable of the pounds was given to a mixed multitude on the Savior’s last journey from Jericho to Jerusalem (see Luke 19), and although there are some differences in the two parables, in essence they teach the same truths and principles.</p>
<p>From the man endowed with many talents more was expected than from the men with lesser talents, yet all were expected to multiply such talents as they were given. In each parable, although relatively little was expected of the men given one talent or one pound, each failed to use his talent. Good use of the talent on the part of the man given one talent was just as important and necessary as on the part of the men given two and five talents.</p>
<p>In this dispensation the Lord has been equally direct in his charge to his children. He has told us that he has given us many things, “For the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talents, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold” (D&amp;C 82:18).</p>
<p>He has admonished us that “Of him unto whom much is given much is required” (D&amp;C 82:3). He also says,</p>
<p><i>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of men. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</i></p>
<p><i>And it shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have.</i> [D&amp;C 60:2–3]</p>
<p>And then we are charged, “Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known” (D&amp;C 60:13). The Savior evidenced little regard for the slothful servant. He expects us to work and to use our initiative. These scriptures clearly emphasize our obligations to use and develop the gifts and talents we have been blessed with—or shall we say to develop the spark of divinity within us? Human experience confirms the soundness of this doctrine.</p>
<h2><b>How To</b></h2>
<p>All of us should be concerned about <i>how</i> to best develop our gifts and talents. First, we should recognize our talents and make up our minds to pay the price necessary to develop them. The price to be paid in developing talents includes among other things faith, study, and persistence.</p>
<p>In developing faith we must never overlook the fact that we are spirit children of God the Eternal Father and that our Father in Heaven will assist us in developing our talents as we do our part. One way in which he will assist us is to open up opportunities for us to use our talents.</p>
<p>Some recognize their talents, but we are told they do not use them because of the fear of men.</p>
<p>Fear destroys faith and deprives us of many blessings. This is clearly brought out in a revelation when the Lord said,</p>
<p><i>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.</i> [D&amp;C 67:3]</p>
<p>We must therefore overcome fear. The Lord has told us that if we are prepared, we shall not fear (see D&amp;C 38:30).</p>
<p>Preparation involves study, and we are also counseled to “seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 88:118). President Benson has specifically suggested that we study the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Eternal progress involves continual study. Increased learning gives us confidence, and confidence engenders faith, and faith banishes fear. I therefore encourage you to never cease to study—this being an important part of developing your talents. We should appreciate that talents are developed by use, and they will not grow and multiply unless they are used.</p>
<p>This principle was clearly taught in the Savior’s parables. As we develop our talents, we should develop the spirit of sharing or giving, not only with those who are closest to us but with all of God’s children. Remember the words of King Benjamin: “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17). The Lord wants us to enjoy our talents, but he also expects us to use them for the enjoyment and benefit of others and to build the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Today we hear much about the need of challenges for the youth as well as for our senior citizens. Despite the fact that we are living in a troublesome period, we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, a most wonderful period in the history of the world—yes, in a new era of growth and development. Opportunities today, for young and old, exceed those of any other age.</p>
<p>We should be grateful to live at this particular time when the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the people of the earth so abundantly. One of the important and distinguishing features of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that its affairs are administered by the lay members of the Church rather than by paid clergy.</p>
<p>I have been told by some of my nonmember friends that the thing about the Church that has impressed them the most is that it gives every person a chance to serve regardless of his age. How true this is.</p>
<p>The Church in reality is a vehicle for the growth and development of God’s children. The priesthood quorums, Primary, Young Women, Sunday School, Relief Society, and other Church organizations in their various activities and programs, all contribute to the development of their members’ talents and provide opportunities for them to be shared with others.</p>
<p>Thus, as stated, exciting and challenging leadership opportunities are afforded men, women, and children of all ages to become involved in interesting and worthwhile projects. This is not only a great opportunity, but likewise a responsibility for Church members because the future growth of the Church is dependent upon the development of leaders—leaders for the general Church administration as well as for missions, stakes, wards, priesthood quorums, auxiliaries, and other Church organizations and activities.</p>
<p>Talents may be developed in many areas of teaching, speaking, missionary work, music, drama, dancing, athletics of many kinds, Scout work, genealogical work, temple work, welfare programs, compassionate service, and many other fields that might be mentioned—all contributing to the development of talents and leadership.</p>
<h2><b>Do You Feel Inadequate?</b></h2>
<p>Frequently, when a person is asked to accept a position in the Church he is prone to say, “Oh, I can’t do that. I haven’t as much experience or education as someone else who may have been serving.” But with our faith, study, work, and prayer, the Lord will make it possible for us to accomplish things that seem impossible.</p>
<p>Our measuring stick should not be someone else’s accomplishments but our own capabilities. Are we truly doing our best? Are we anxious to develop our talents to the greatest degree and use them in building the kingdom of God? When a person does this he develops his talents, is happy, and grows in knowledge and spirit. The Lord will make you equal to every task you are called upon to perform as you do your part.</p>
<p>President Heber J. Grant used to frequently use this quote: “That which we try to do, and persist in doing, becomes easy to do, not because its nature is changed, but because our power to do is developed” (Josiah Gilbert Holland [Timothy Titcomb, pseud.], <i>Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs</i> [New York: Charles Scribner, 1859], 291). President Grant exemplified this principle throughout his entire life, and his persistence no doubt played a great part in many of his accomplishments.</p>
<p>As a young man I was thrilled and inspired by the stories of this great Church leader—how, even though seemingly lacking in some talents, through determination and persistence he developed outstanding skill. As a boy he was a very poor penman, and his teacher criticized his writing, saying it was almost impossible to read. This was a challenge to President Grant, and he practiced writing hours upon hours until he finally became an expert penman.</p>
<h2><b>Magnify Each Talent</b></h2>
<p>Recently I listened to a new convert tell in a meeting how he had three Church assignments. First, he put the flag up each day in front of the chapel. He then briefly explained the meaning of the flag to him. Second, he kept the hymnbooks in repair. Here he mentioned how these hymns were so inspiring and contained much doctrine and prophesy. He briefly referred to the hymn “O, My Father” and its reference to a Mother in Heaven. Third, he was a home teacher and explained what this service can mean to both the teacher as well as to the person being visited and taught.</p>
<p>This man enjoyed and appreciated these three opportunities to serve and was blessing the lives of others as well as magnifying his talents.</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear of someone thinking his or her assignment is not very important. This reminds me of a young man who gave his intended wife a diamond engagement ring. In doing so, he remarked, “It isn’t very big.” Whereupon she replied, “It’s as big as we make it.” There are no unimportant callings in the Church.</p>
<p>This is a time of preparation for some other assignment and responsibility. We will be given increased opportunities and responsibilities as we serve with an eye single to the glory of God. We will be magnified and our talents will be increased—yes, even a hundredfold (see D&amp;C 82:18). As we develop our talents and share them in serving our fellowmen, we will find great peace, happiness, joy, and contentment, as well as growth and development.</p>
<p>As previously stated, we are living in a troublesome period, but we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, when, in my opinion, the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out on the face of the earth more today than ever before.</p>
<p>I am grateful that my spirit was reserved to come to this earth at this time—in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This dispensation was opened by one of the greatest manifestations of the Godhead ever made to man when God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to the boy Joseph Smith. Through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness was restored, the power to act in the name of God was restored, and God’s church was reestablished upon the earth with apostles and prophets guiding and directing the affairs of the kingdom of God on the earth today.</p>
<p>I bear you my witness that our beloved prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, is guiding this Church under the direction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Most of you have this same testimony. What a tremendous effect this knowledge has in the lives of those who accept his doctrine. We know that our Father in Heaven loves us and is interested in our welfare, growth, and development. Yes, he has said, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39).</p>
<p>May we live the gospel principles and follow the counsel of our leaders, and may the choice blessings of our Father in Heaven be with you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You might recall in the beloved Dr. Seuss children’s book Horton Hears a Who! how Horton, who was an elephant, had a chance encounter with a speck of dust, from whence a voice, barely audible, called out for help. Horton recognized that the voice was coming from the speck of dust and proceeded to do all he could to protect and defend this colony of Whos, who were “too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes.”
Horton perceived that someone was in distress and realized that he could help. Instead of discounting his newly discovered friends, and amidst scoffs and scorn from others, he did all he could to give aid. He had a clear understanding of his ability to rescue and protect the Who colony. Through his actions he demonstrated his ability to give aid, share his light, and serve. As Horton exclaimed, “A person’s a person, no matter how small.”
Being Grateful
Having just celebrated Thanksgiving this past week, and as we transition from November into the month of December and celebrate the birth of our beloved Savior, it seems particularly natural that gratitude has taken center stage in our minds and in our hearts—as it should. No matter how humble and meager our circumstances, we each have so much to be grateful for.
President Thomas S. Monson said of gratitude:
To express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven. [“The Divine Gift of Gratitude,” Ensign, November 2010]
He also said:
We can lift ourselves and others as well when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude. [“Divine Gift”]
Gratitude is an expression of our faith. Negativity most certainly breeds despair, depression, lack of enthusiasm, and critical analysis of that which is most likely not our right to criticize or judge.
Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, in a devotional address on gratitude given at BYU, said:
Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make ­others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.
. . . Gratitude is a commandment of the Father. [“Live in Thanksgiving Daily,” BYU devotional address, 31 October 2000]
Doctrine and Covenants 59:7 reads, “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.”
While it may be more challenging to feel grateful when we are in the throes of trials and disappointments, those are the very times when we need to stop, take a look around, and count and list our blessings one by one. It has not been surprising to me throughout my life how</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning! It is a cherished privilege to share this time with you this morning. Thirty years of college teaching, 32 years of parenthood, 40 years of Church service, and 45 years of performing as a musician have convinced me that I am nothing. As to my own strength, I am weak, and I must depend fully upon the Lord if I am to succeed in accomplishing anything good. You recognize those are nearly the words of Ammon in the chapter 26 of the book of Alma (see verses 11–12). Moroni said something very similar:
And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be because of unbelief.
And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God. [Moroni 10:24–25]
I know that is true! Those of us who have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost will never achieve our full potential without His presence in our lives. In the words of the Savior Himself:
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. [John 15:4–5]
I know I am completely dependent on the Lord, but despite my weaknesses and inadequacies and my mistakes and even failures, in His strength many good things have also been accomplished.
Early in my life, at age three, I began a string of experiences when I contracted polio that would always make me feel a keen sense of dependence on the Lord. This happened about six months before the vaccine was released that has now nearly eliminated this devastating disease in the United States. When we have the capacity to accomplish great good, there is always commensurate opposition and adversity to try to prevent us from fulfilling our potential. I have never begrudged having this challenge in my life because I think it has blessed me in my spiritual and musical development more than it could ever hinder me. I believe, too, that the Lord has used this adversity in my life to better prepare me for a world dominated by humanism. Humanists believe that man must succeed completely on his own abilities with no supernatural power to help. They believe in depending on themselves, not on the Lord. There is a terrifying scripture in the book of Helaman about that. In chapter 4, verse 13, Mormon describes the people of that time: “And because of . . . their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper.”
I needed and felt extra power from the Lord from early in my life. Because of the polio, I went through a series of surgical operations. Each time I faced on</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The first thing I want to say today is that I want to testify I know Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer. I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that He stands at the head of this Church, guiding it through a living prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley. I am so thankful for that testimony.
It is a sweet experience for Sister Oaks and me to be here on the BYU campus this morning. This is not our first BYU devotional. We started attending them in September 1951 when we were sophomores at BY High School on the old BYU lower campus, where the Provo City Library is now located.
A great deal has changed on this campus since 1951, but one thing that has remained constant is the sweet spirit you bring to the devotional setting.
I know why Gloria and I are here today. The First Presidency sent me a letter assigning me to talk on March 21st at the BYU—Provo devotional, so here we are.
A more interesting question is, “Why are you here at BYU this morning?” A university education anywhere takes a lot of time, effort, and money. And there can be a lot of frustration found on the campus.
—Maybe someone pointed out to you that university graduates get better jobs and make more money.
—Or a friend may have convinced you that you can have a lot of fun in college.
—Or maybe you came hoping to find a spouse.
—Certainly you can become a more interesting person through your education.
—And you should be able to learn to see life through a richer set of lenses.
Hopefully these and all of your other aspirations and expectations will be realized.
But I would like to discuss another purpose for higher education—especially at BYU. This school experience should provide you with the opportunity to determine your true identity—to find out who you really are.
During our assignment in the Africa Southeast Area Presidency, Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles came down to conduct an area training session. During that session Elder Nelson made a statement that resonated in my heart then and continues to do so today. He said, “Understand who you are in God’s plan.” This is a powerful concept that should be a major objective of our life here in mortality: to understand who we are in God’s plan.
What a sweet blessing it is to come to know—to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost—that there is a God and that He has a plan with an exalted purpose for each of His children. It is also a very powerful, personal driving factor to be able to accept that we each can have a particular role to play in this plan.
This brings us to your unique BYU opportunity. While you are here, you owe it to yourself to make an extra effort to discover, in every detail possible, who you really are—to discover your true potential and your eternal potential in God’s plan.
The vast majority of you came to BYU with a foundation in t</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Today as I stand before you, I am humbled by the invitation to share my thoughts and bear my testimony of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. It has been mentioned that I am in my 31st year here at Brigham Young University, and I can truly say that this opportunity to address you has never been on my radar screen. Indeed, I have comfortably sat in the audience for more than three decades now and have never ceased to be inspired each week by the music and the spoken word. Rosalind, your selection today was marvelous, and the choir has set the tone and tenor of the message that I wish to share with you.
First let me tell you marvelous students how awed I am to be in your presence. Do you know who you are? You come to this university from all 50 states and from 120 countries around the world. You come from big cities and small towns, from farms and foreign capitols. Seventy-five percent of the young men and 12 percent of the young women have served missions throughout the world for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Almost three-quarters of this student body speak fluently a language other than English. You are literally an “army of God” in that most of you have given two years of your life to preach, teach, testify, and expound on the life and mission of the Only Begotten of the Father, the Redeemer of the World, the Lamb of God, our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. You have given freely of your time, energy, talents, and resources to declare to the world that He lives!
You are as bright and talented as any students we have ever had at this great university. Your college boards and your grade point averages rank you among the best college students on any university campus in America. Year after year you place BYU in the top 10 universities in the land for students who go on to obtain advanced degrees. You are highly sought after by recruiters in science and industry. You later become our bishops and stake presidents, our Relief Society and Young Women presidents. You are schooled in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and His image is in your countenance. You are obedient to the laws and commandments of our Father in Heaven; you have exercised faith in the redemption of Him who created you; you have experienced “a change of heart.” You “have felt to sing the song of redeeming love,” and, like Alma, I would ask, “Can ye feel so now?” (Alma 5:26).
In 1997, while building a deck on my home, I received a call from a stake president who resides in Argentina. He had dropped by the athletic department and wanted to visit with me about our swimming program and the possibility of athletic scholarships for swimmers from his stake. I told him that I was quite dirty from the construction project I was working on, but if he would come to my home on Sunday, I would be glad to visit with him.
When he arrived he brought with him a young former bishop from his stake who was at that time doing graduate work a</span>
