  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="A wonderful painting hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Entitled &lt;i&gt;Aristotle with a Bust of Homer,&lt;/i&gt; it was commissioned during a time when its creator—the great Dutch painter Rembrandt—was facing personal financial difficulty, made even more grating by the artistic demands coming from his patrons. Art historian Sister Wendy Beckett observed that, for Rembrandt, immersed in this period of personal and creative struggle, the painting seemed “to have sparked off some deep inner response”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; concerning creative integrity—what, and how, we choose to “create” with the gifts we are given.

The painting depicts the great, lavishly dressed philosopher Aristotle wearing a long, gold chain—a present from his most famous student, Alexander the Great. Aristotle’s hand rests on a small statue of the immortal poet Homer, who had already passed out of this world and into legend. Also present in his thoughts, but invisible to the eye, is Aristotle’s own great mentor, the famed philosopher Plato. Under Plato’s tutelage Aristotle learned to seek after knowledge and to develop his remarkable intellectual gifts so that he too could achieve new understanding and pass those great skills of thought on to another generation.

In turn, Aristotle became the teacher and received Alexander as his student. No doubt he hoped that Alexander could embody his ideal of a philosopher-king: a ruler as good and wise as he was powerful. But although Aristotle used his gifts of intellect in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, he could only stand by and watch as Alexander used his gifts not to further knowledge or establish peace among nations but to wage war and build an empire on the bodies of the conquered.

Compared to Aristotle and Alexander, we know very little about Homer, the poet who composed &lt;i&gt;The Iliad &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; and whose likeness captured Aristotle’s attention. In good Greek tradition Homer was supposed to have been blind—although most poets and prophets were depicted as being “blind,” symbolizing not so much a physical defect as a moral strength: being blind to the falsity and compromises of mortality but seers of the realities beyond. Their writings therefore presented a different standard—a true standard—by which a man might measure himself.

In contrast, even in his lifetime Aristotle had a taste of the honor that would follow him for thousands of years after his death, but that recognition does not seem enough to quiet the great man’s soul in the midst of solitary introspection. Where Plato had trained Aristotle, a great philosopher and friend of man, Aristotle had trained Alexander, a conqueror, a worldly king of kings who gained the whole world, then lost it all when he died at the age of 33.

Through Rembrandt we see Aristotle contemplating the worth of what he will leave behind—including his writings, which would serve as the foundation of Western scientific and philosophic thought for more than a thousand years. And yet he seems drawn to ponder whether he has actually been “successful”: whether he has properly used his gifts of intellect and of teaching—whether he has done what he was truly capable of doing. We have caught him in a moment of private discourse with the blind, transcendent poet—as if wondering what significance the poet’s blind eyes would attach to his golden chain, fashioned from the plunder of Alexander’s victories. We must wonder, with him, whether a teacher is truly honored by such a gift if the giver is a student who failed to learn.

Consider Aristotle’s dilemma. The question of true success—of feeling satisfied that we are rising to the promise and responsibility of the gifts we are given—can weigh heavily upon anyone, particularly a young graduate. That is why it can be helpful to keep in mind that the real difficulty is not usually in knowing what to do but rather in doing it. As William Shakespeare rather slyly observed, “If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces” (&lt;i&gt;The Merchant of Venice,&lt;/i&gt; act 1, scene 2, lines 13–15).

The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow translated Shakespeare’s negative into a positive, with familiar sentiments for any college student:

&lt;i&gt;The heights by great men reached and kept&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Were not attained by sudden flight,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But they, while their companions slept,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Were toiling upward in the night.&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;The Ladder of St. Augustine&lt;/i&gt; (1858), stanza 10]

Two millennia after Aristotle, the inventor genius Thomas Edison in turn echoed Longfellow as he wrote, “Many of life’s failures are experienced by people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.” Edison also formulated the famous equation for achieving that success; namely, that “genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” It is unsettling to consider what might have happened if Edison had exerted only 95 percent of that necessary perspiration and the final 1 percent—that inspired spark—had never come.

Now, with Aristotle and Rembrandt and Edison in mind, consider great scientific achievements or works of art that have especially moved you, leaders who have affected you, and writers and teachers and thinkers who have inspired you. Then consider an image from Genesis:

&lt;i&gt;The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And God said, Let there be light.&lt;/i&gt; [Genesis 1:2–3]

With great time and effort our abilities can be honed and polished and refined until they are capable of bringing forth great works. However, without that brooding, creative Spirit—without that spark of divine light—those gifts remain dormant, “without form, and void.” But when that Spirit moves upon the waters—when it moves upon us—it can organize and enlighten those gifts that we have worked to develop and, through the sacrifice of our time and effort and abilities, bring forth remarkable creations out of those elements.

While still a BYU student himself, my father—like almost every graduate in this auditorium—was profoundly touched by the mentoring and friendship of remarkable professors at this university. He particularly recalls a conversation with Dr. Robert K. Thomas, who served as the university’s provost.

“The problem,” said Dr. Thomas, “is that so many of our students leave with the idea that they should seek material prosperity, worldly influence, and prestige—that this is what the Lord meant when He said, ‘Let your light so shine before men.’”

Then, lifting his hand and tracing a rising arc, he said, “But all too often, by the time their star is up—the light is out.”

Looking my father squarely in the eye, he said, “Don’t let that happen to you.”

Let us not allow our light to go out—either through neglect or misuse of our abilities or through the mistaken conviction that the light is our own. Think of Aristotle, brought to silent contemplation at the end of a long and successful life. Think of poor men’s cottages that might have been princes’ palaces. Think of Edison, who “while [his] companions slept, / [Was] toiling upward in the night.” Then remember the divine Spirit brooding upon the waters. Yes, the Savior admonished us to “Let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works” (Matthew 5:16), but He also taught, “I am the light which ye shall hold up” (3 Nephi 18:24).

And, if He is our light, our star will never go out. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>A wonderful painting hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Entitled <i>Aristotle with a Bust of Homer,</i> it was commissioned during a time when its creator—the great Dutch painter Rembrandt—was facing personal financial difficulty, made even more grating by the artistic demands coming from his patrons. Art historian Sister Wendy Beckett observed that, for Rembrandt, immersed in this period of personal and creative struggle, the painting seemed “to have sparked off some deep inner response”<sup>1</sup> concerning creative integrity—what, and how, we choose to “create” with the gifts we are given.</p>
<p>The painting depicts the great, lavishly dressed philosopher Aristotle wearing a long, gold chain—a present from his most famous student, Alexander the Great. Aristotle’s hand rests on a small statue of the immortal poet Homer, who had already passed out of this world and into legend. Also present in his thoughts, but invisible to the eye, is Aristotle’s own great mentor, the famed philosopher Plato. Under Plato’s tutelage Aristotle learned to seek after knowledge and to develop his remarkable intellectual gifts so that he too could achieve new understanding and pass those great skills of thought on to another generation.</p>
<p>In turn, Aristotle became the teacher and received Alexander as his student. No doubt he hoped that Alexander could embody his ideal of a philosopher-king: a ruler as good and wise as he was powerful. But although Aristotle used his gifts of intellect in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, he could only stand by and watch as Alexander used his gifts not to further knowledge or establish peace among nations but to wage war and build an empire on the bodies of the conquered.</p>
<p>Compared to Aristotle and Alexander, we know very little about Homer, the poet who composed <i>The Iliad </i>and <i>The Odyssey</i> and whose likeness captured Aristotle’s attention. In good Greek tradition Homer was supposed to have been blind—although most poets and prophets were depicted as being “blind,” symbolizing not so much a physical defect as a moral strength: being blind to the falsity and compromises of mortality but seers of the realities beyond. Their writings therefore presented a different standard—a true standard—by which a man might measure himself.</p>
<p>In contrast, even in his lifetime Aristotle had a taste of the honor that would follow him for thousands of years after his death, but that recognition does not seem enough to quiet the great man’s soul in the midst of solitary introspection. Where Plato had trained Aristotle, a great philosopher and friend of man, Aristotle had trained Alexander, a conqueror, a worldly king of kings who gained the whole world, then lost it all when he died at the age of 33.</p>
<p>Through Rembrandt we see Aristotle contemplating the worth of what he will leave behind—including his writings, which would serve as the foundation of Western scientific and philosophic thought for more than a thousand years. And yet he seems drawn to ponder whether he has actually been “successful”: whether he has properly used his gifts of intellect and of teaching—whether he has done what he was truly capable of doing. We have caught him in a moment of private discourse with the blind, transcendent poet—as if wondering what significance the poet’s blind eyes would attach to his golden chain, fashioned from the plunder of Alexander’s victories. We must wonder, with him, whether a teacher is truly honored by such a gift if the giver is a student who failed to learn.</p>
<p>Consider Aristotle’s dilemma. The question of true success—of feeling satisfied that we are rising to the promise and responsibility of the gifts we are given—can weigh heavily upon anyone, particularly a young graduate. That is why it can be helpful to keep in mind that the real difficulty is not usually in knowing what to do but rather in doing it. As William Shakespeare rather slyly observed, “If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces” (<i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> act 1, scene 2, lines 13–15).</p>
<p>The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow translated Shakespeare’s negative into a positive, with familiar sentiments for any college student:</p>
<p><i>The heights by great men reached and kept</i></p>
<p><i>Were not attained by sudden flight,</i></p>
<p><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i></p>
<p><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i></p>
<p>[<i>The Ladder of St. Augustine</i> (1858), stanza 10]</p>
<p>Two millennia after Aristotle, the inventor genius Thomas Edison in turn echoed Longfellow as he wrote, “Many of life’s failures are experienced by people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.” Edison also formulated the famous equation for achieving that success; namely, that “genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” It is unsettling to consider what might have happened if Edison had exerted only 95 percent of that necessary perspiration and the final 1 percent—that inspired spark—had never come.</p>
<p>Now, with Aristotle and Rembrandt and Edison in mind, consider great scientific achievements or works of art that have especially moved you, leaders who have affected you, and writers and teachers and thinkers who have inspired you. Then consider an image from Genesis:</p>
<p><i>The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</i></p>
<p><i>And God said, Let there be light.</i> [Genesis 1:2–3]</p>
<p>With great time and effort our abilities can be honed and polished and refined until they are capable of bringing forth great works. However, without that brooding, creative Spirit—without that spark of divine light—those gifts remain dormant, “without form, and void.” But when that Spirit moves upon the waters—when it moves upon us—it can organize and enlighten those gifts that we have worked to develop and, through the sacrifice of our time and effort and abilities, bring forth remarkable creations out of those elements.</p>
<p>While still a BYU student himself, my father—like almost every graduate in this auditorium—was profoundly touched by the mentoring and friendship of remarkable professors at this university. He particularly recalls a conversation with Dr. Robert K. Thomas, who served as the university’s provost.</p>
<p>“The problem,” said Dr. Thomas, “is that so many of our students leave with the idea that they should seek material prosperity, worldly influence, and prestige—that this is what the Lord meant when He said, ‘Let your light so shine before men.’”</p>
<p>Then, lifting his hand and tracing a rising arc, he said, “But all too often, by the time their star is up—the light is out.”</p>
<p>Looking my father squarely in the eye, he said, “Don’t let that happen to you.”</p>
<p>Let us not allow our light to go out—either through neglect or misuse of our abilities or through the mistaken conviction that the light is our own. Think of Aristotle, brought to silent contemplation at the end of a long and successful life. Think of poor men’s cottages that might have been princes’ palaces. Think of Edison, who “while [his] companions slept, / [Was] toiling upward in the night.” Then remember the divine Spirit brooding upon the waters. Yes, the Savior admonished us to “Let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works” (Matthew 5:16), but He also taught, “I am the light which ye shall hold up” (3 Nephi 18:24).</p>
<p>And, if He is our light, our star will never go out. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Shortly after accepting my job at BYU, I called Elder Jeffrey R. Holland’s office to ask if he would do the voice-over for an athletics commercial during the height of Jimmermania. Because of my football career I had gotten to know Elder Holland, and I thought he would be the perfect person, with his distinctive voice, for the job.
Then I had a meeting with Tom Holmoe, BYU’s athletic director, and I let him know how excited I was about the possibility of including Elder Holland in our project. I naïvely assumed that Tom would be thrilled about my phone call and invitation.
I was wrong. It was a major faux pas. He let me know that any invitation to one of the leaders of the Church needed to go through the president of the school. I quickly wrote an apology to President Samuelson, and this was his inspiring reply:
Chad,
No need to worry. We sometimes forget to inform those coming into BYU employment of the unique way things are done at BYU, particularly when it relates to contacts and requests of the senior Brethren. You are like those guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom because no one ever taught them the gospel. We probably should not take this one up the line, but feel free to raise any good ideas you have. Sorry we didn’t loop you in earlier. I know Elder Holland’s only concern would be disappointing you. Know that you are loved and appreciated. All the best.
Cec
I love that letter. It is a shining example of my topic today: “The World Needs to See and Feel Your Light.” What does President Samuelson’s letter, with his good-natured correction for me, have to do with this theme? Everything! How do you think it made me feel as a new BYU employee to receive that letter? It inspired me. He didn’t crush me with his authority; it was just the opposite. I could feel his light and the love he had for me.
As I share my thoughts with you today, I hope to better prepare you for tomorrow. Many of you will run your own companies. You may hold positions of leadership. You would be wise to follow President Samuelson’s great example of how to correct and inspire others.
President Samuelson has tried to respond to every email from every student. Think of the encouragement and faith that he has shared with you and other students over the last eleven years. He has certainly followed the counsel of the Savior to let his light shine. He and Sister Samuelson are awesome, and I will miss my association with them. President Kevin Worthen and his wife, Peggy, will likewise win your hearts and earn your respect as they serve you. I know President Worthen and have complete confidence in him.
Our Savior Jesus Christ said, “Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven” (3 Nephi 12:16). That is my favorite scripture. Let your light shine.
When President Thomas S.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a glorious sight you are! It’s an honor, my young friends, to be here with you. I feel the tremendous weight of the responsibility which is mine to provide you with a message which will hopefully be helpful to you not only for today but, indeed, throughout your lives.
As I gaze at this vast audience, I’m reminded that each of you is one of a kind. Each has had experiences unique to you and you alone. You have come to Brigham Young University from locations across the country and the world. You come from varied backgrounds. And yet there is much that we have in common one with another. We know where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we leave this life. We know that we are children of our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. We know we want to return to Him after we leave this earthly existence. We know that what we do—and don’t do—here in mortality is of utmost importance. We also know that, should we fall short, our Savior has provided us with the precious gift of the Atonement and that, if we change our lives and our hearts and take advantage of the power of the Atonement, our sins and shortcomings will be forgiven and forgotten.
We have in common the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we know it is our responsibility to share the truths of the gospel with others. One of the chief ways in which we can share the gospel is to be a righteous example, and it is about this that I wish to speak to you today. The Apostle Paul admonished, “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”1 He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be “as lights in the world.”2
This is what I would hope for each of us—that we might be a light to the world.
What is light? Webster’s dictionary lists no less than fifteen definitions for the noun light. I prefer the simple “something that illuminates.” Just as turning on a light switch in a dark room will bathe the room in light, so providing an example of righteousness—and therefore being a light—can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.
Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. Said President Harold B. Lee:
Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God—that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed. Moroni spoke of [that light,] that Spirit when he said:
“For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. And, I have to say, you are an awesome sight! My oldest daughter, Mackenzie, is graduating today, so I am especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy our family experiences through having children attend BYU.
Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:
I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually. [“Your Gifts Bless Generations,” insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]
I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I hope you feel that as well.
Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed many tests—some academic and some in other aspects of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.
It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when
Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. “It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, ‘What have I done?’ and, ‘What do I do now?’” he recalls. “I found myself on my knees within minutes.”
Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD ’78). Edwards set a chair directly in front of Mendenhall’s chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.
“[LaVell Edward’s] first words were ‘You have a tough job.’ Then there was a pause and silence,” says Mendenhall. “It wasn’t very comforting to hear that. But then [LaVell] just said, ‘But it’s a great job.’ I didn’t know what he meant by either at the time.”
Mendenhall has come to consider [Coach] Edwards a mentor and an advocate. “It’s nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what it’s like to be a head coach here.” The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be. [Peter B. Gardner, “The Bronco Way,” BYU Magazine, winter 2007, 22–23]
Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, co</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">His reputation for concern for the one—particularly the widow or the wounded, the poor or the persecuted—is widely known. Perhaps you would also like to know, if you don’t already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monson’s close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because I’m sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, I’d like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didn’t know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
