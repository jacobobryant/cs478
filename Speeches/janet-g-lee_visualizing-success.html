  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="The last time I spoke on the same program with our son Michael was at his missionary farewell. And I was equally proud that day as I am today. But he has not always been so wise. He has grown in wisdom and judgment. After such a serious talk, I cannot help but tell a story on him.

Shortly before Michael went on his mission, his brother-in-law Tom Jacobson made him an offer. If Michael would let Tom break three raw eggs on Michaels head, Tom would give him twenty dollars. It sounded like a good deal. The degradation would last only a short time, could be removed by putting his clothes through the washing machine and jumping into the shower, and he could always use an extra twenty dollars. Picture him, if you will, sitting in our kitchen with a towel wrapped around his shoulders as the first egg was cracked on his head. Picture also his brother-in-law gleefully and ceremoniously rubbing the contents into Michaels hair. Then came the second egg. The streams of intermixed deep yellow and clear liquid began inching down his cheeks, into his ears, nose, and eyes, and into the corners of his mouth. But not to worry, just one more egg and the twenty dollars would be his. So he waited. And waited. And then waited some more. And then he heard Tom say, "Naw, its not worth it."

As Michael demonstrated, some of our experiences in life could prove successful, and sometimes we could end up with egg on our face, which leads me right into my talk.

I love the cool brightness of September mornings with their contrasts of harvests and new beginnings. For me, the start of each school year is something of a contrast as well. My years as a student and then as a teacher stir mixed memories in me. To this day when I enter a place of learning, the smells of old books and new pencils awaken visions of expectations as well as fears. There is the excitement of starting anew, but there is also the trepidation of failure.

This campus is filled with potential. I am aware of your abilities, your worthiness, and your desire to learn. I feel humble in your presence. I also wonder if you, too, feel somewhat overwhelmed by each others brilliance. Do you ever fear whether or not you will succeed? I want you to know that each night when Rex and I kneel in prayer, we plead for your success. Im sure as you study and prepare your assignments, you pray, too. So if you work hard and ask for divine help, will you be successful? Yes, you will. But let me tell you a secret: Much of our success will depend on how we handle an occasional failure. Will we be defeated or will we learn from our mistakes? It is about facing failure, learning from our mistakes, and thus experiencing success that I would like to speak.

I remember vividly a distant September morning from my past. I had just instructed my first-grade students to write their names on the top of a paper after folding it in half. There was a bit of a scurry as everyone completed this two-part task rather quickly. Everyone, that is, except John and Bart. Johns paper was wadded tightly in his hand and his head was on his desk. Bart stared blankly at me with wide, inquisitive eyes. I could feel their inner cries for help and moved quickly to render aid. Johns distress seemed more demanding, so I asked Bart to begin on a picture. John had tried to fold his paper but had done it wrong and was frustrated by his mistake. No attempt to show him how could jar him into action. "You do it for me," he finally cried.

By the time I got to Bart, the class was getting restless, and my first inclination was to fold his paper for him and get on with things. He could learn another day. "No," he stopped me. "Show me how." Then I noticed his name wasnt on his paper. "Show me how to write my name, too," he pleaded. I knelt beside him and said softly, "Okay, make a B." His eyes grew wider. "How do you make a B?" he asked, unashamed.

I was a new teacher and that was a long first week. During the first three months of school those two boys needed more help than the other children, but there was a major difference in the way each responded to his mistakes. John continued to feel diminished by every error and could concentrate only on his failures. By staring at the stack of wadded-up paper on his desk, he could not visualize success. Bart, on the other hand, thrived on learning from each mistake and even taped the best printing of his name on his desk each week so he could mark his progress.

Its interesting to note that at first the ability of both boys was similar, but by the end of the school year, Bart was surprising everyone. Both John and Bart began the school year a bit less able than the other children, at least in their most measurable preparation. Yet one boy was able to see beyond his inadequacies and move forward while the other was not.

Like my two students, we often feel in adequate, especially with the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. It is not out of the ordinary to feel this way when we are reaching up and stretching to climb higher. It is reassuring, however, that we are all afraid of failure. It is a common denominator among us. Our true test is how we embrace that fear. I like Emersons approach: "They can conquer who believe they can. . . . He has not learned the lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear" ("Courage," &lt;i&gt;Society and Solitude, &lt;/i&gt;1870).

Yet what of our attempts that are not successful? How do we view them? Albert Einstein has said: "I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right." He may have been a genius, but the theory of relativity didnt just pop into his mind one night at Hogi Yogi. Nor did Marie and Pierre Curie unlock the secret of radium isolation while watching reruns of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek.&lt;/i&gt;

As Elder Neal A. Maxwell states, "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability!" ("Its Service, Not Status, That Counts," &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;July 1975, p. 7).

Does this mean, however, that a willing heart guarantees immediate success? Usually the road to victory involves encountering a great many mistakes. The Lord wants us to learn from our mistakes because that is how we become strong. He does not expect us to be perfect, just to keep trying. Hasnt he told us, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; . . . for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27).

This is why every twenty-four hours our Father in Heaven gives us a brand-new day - a chance to correct yesterdays mistakes. It is somewhat parallel to the&lt;i&gt;Groundhog-Day &lt;/i&gt;theory: We just get another chance to keep on trying. When we attempt anything new, it is easy to feel discouraged. No one is alone in that regard. Initial failure, or a less-than-desirable result, is the price we pay for learning anything new. Sometimes we compare ourselves with others who are more experienced or whom we perceive as being more gifted. At such times we want to give up, forgetting the process of progress and the road to perfection. As we read in Joshua, "Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed" (Joshua 1:9).

Margaret Mitchell, author of &lt;i&gt;Gone With the Wind, &lt;/i&gt;spoke the following concerning her frame of mind during the writing of her famous novel:

&lt;i&gt;It was going along pretty well until somebody sent me a new book called &lt;/i&gt;John Browns Body,&lt;i&gt; by Stephen Vincent Benet. When I finished reading that magnificent Civil War epic, I burst into tears and put my own manuscript away on a closet shelf. &lt;/i&gt;John Browns Body &lt;i&gt;gave me such a terrible case of the humbles that it was months before I could find the necessary faith in myself and my book to go on.&lt;/i&gt;

Momentarily, Margaret Mitchell doubted herself too much to go on. As William Shakespeare put it, "Our doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft might win, By fearing to attempt" (&lt;i&gt;Measure for Measure, &lt;/i&gt;act I, sc. 4, lines 7779).

My student John saw his crumpled-up paper and visualized failure. He didnt even want to try. But Bart taped his name to his desk and kept his eye on how it would look when written correctly and then marked his progress.

Our Savior is the perfect image for us to visualize as we strive to be successful. We need to tape his image on the pages of our lives so that we may visualize his perfect life as we lift ourselves up from our failures. That we may mark our progress as we learn from our mistakes is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>The last time I spoke on the same program with our son Michael was at his missionary farewell. And I was equally proud that day as I am today. But he has not always been so wise. He has grown in wisdom and judgment. After such a serious talk, I cannot help but tell a story on him.</p>
<p>Shortly before Michael went on his mission, his brother-in-law Tom Jacobson made him an offer. If Michael would let Tom break three raw eggs on Michaels head, Tom would give him twenty dollars. It sounded like a good deal. The degradation would last only a short time, could be removed by putting his clothes through the washing machine and jumping into the shower, and he could always use an extra twenty dollars. Picture him, if you will, sitting in our kitchen with a towel wrapped around his shoulders as the first egg was cracked on his head. Picture also his brother-in-law gleefully and ceremoniously rubbing the contents into Michaels hair. Then came the second egg. The streams of intermixed deep yellow and clear liquid began inching down his cheeks, into his ears, nose, and eyes, and into the corners of his mouth. But not to worry, just one more egg and the twenty dollars would be his. So he waited. And waited. And then waited some more. And then he heard Tom say, "Naw, its not worth it."</p>
<p>As Michael demonstrated, some of our experiences in life could prove successful, and sometimes we could end up with egg on our face, which leads me right into my talk.</p>
<p>I love the cool brightness of September mornings with their contrasts of harvests and new beginnings. For me, the start of each school year is something of a contrast as well. My years as a student and then as a teacher stir mixed memories in me. To this day when I enter a place of learning, the smells of old books and new pencils awaken visions of expectations as well as fears. There is the excitement of starting anew, but there is also the trepidation of failure.</p>
<p>This campus is filled with potential. I am aware of your abilities, your worthiness, and your desire to learn. I feel humble in your presence. I also wonder if you, too, feel somewhat overwhelmed by each others brilliance. Do you ever fear whether or not you will succeed? I want you to know that each night when Rex and I kneel in prayer, we plead for your success. Im sure as you study and prepare your assignments, you pray, too. So if you work hard and ask for divine help, will you be successful? Yes, you will. But let me tell you a secret: Much of our success will depend on how we handle an occasional failure. Will we be defeated or will we learn from our mistakes? It is about facing failure, learning from our mistakes, and thus experiencing success that I would like to speak.</p>
<p>I remember vividly a distant September morning from my past. I had just instructed my first-grade students to write their names on the top of a paper after folding it in half. There was a bit of a scurry as everyone completed this two-part task rather quickly. Everyone, that is, except John and Bart. Johns paper was wadded tightly in his hand and his head was on his desk. Bart stared blankly at me with wide, inquisitive eyes. I could feel their inner cries for help and moved quickly to render aid. Johns distress seemed more demanding, so I asked Bart to begin on a picture. John had tried to fold his paper but had done it wrong and was frustrated by his mistake. No attempt to show him how could jar him into action. "You do it for me," he finally cried.</p>
<p>By the time I got to Bart, the class was getting restless, and my first inclination was to fold his paper for him and get on with things. He could learn another day. "No," he stopped me. "Show me how." Then I noticed his name wasnt on his paper. "Show me how to write my name, too," he pleaded. I knelt beside him and said softly, "Okay, make a B." His eyes grew wider. "How do you make a B?" he asked, unashamed.</p>
<p>I was a new teacher and that was a long first week. During the first three months of school those two boys needed more help than the other children, but there was a major difference in the way each responded to his mistakes. John continued to feel diminished by every error and could concentrate only on his failures. By staring at the stack of wadded-up paper on his desk, he could not visualize success. Bart, on the other hand, thrived on learning from each mistake and even taped the best printing of his name on his desk each week so he could mark his progress.</p>
<p>Its interesting to note that at first the ability of both boys was similar, but by the end of the school year, Bart was surprising everyone. Both John and Bart began the school year a bit less able than the other children, at least in their most measurable preparation. Yet one boy was able to see beyond his inadequacies and move forward while the other was not.</p>
<p>Like my two students, we often feel in adequate, especially with the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. It is not out of the ordinary to feel this way when we are reaching up and stretching to climb higher. It is reassuring, however, that we are all afraid of failure. It is a common denominator among us. Our true test is how we embrace that fear. I like Emersons approach: "They can conquer who believe they can. . . . He has not learned the lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear" ("Courage," <i>Society and Solitude, </i>1870).</p>
<p>Yet what of our attempts that are not successful? How do we view them? Albert Einstein has said: "I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right." He may have been a genius, but the theory of relativity didnt just pop into his mind one night at Hogi Yogi. Nor did Marie and Pierre Curie unlock the secret of radium isolation while watching reruns of <i>Star Trek.</i></p>
<p>As Elder Neal A. Maxwell states, "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability!" ("Its Service, Not Status, That Counts," <i>Ensign, </i>July 1975, p. 7).</p>
<p>Does this mean, however, that a willing heart guarantees immediate success? Usually the road to victory involves encountering a great many mistakes. The Lord wants us to learn from our mistakes because that is how we become strong. He does not expect us to be perfect, just to keep trying. Hasnt he told us, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; . . . for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27).</p>
<p>This is why every twenty-four hours our Father in Heaven gives us a brand-new day - a chance to correct yesterdays mistakes. It is somewhat parallel to the<i>Groundhog-Day </i>theory: We just get another chance to keep on trying. When we attempt anything new, it is easy to feel discouraged. No one is alone in that regard. Initial failure, or a less-than-desirable result, is the price we pay for learning anything new. Sometimes we compare ourselves with others who are more experienced or whom we perceive as being more gifted. At such times we want to give up, forgetting the process of progress and the road to perfection. As we read in Joshua, "Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed" (Joshua 1:9).</p>
<p>Margaret Mitchell, author of <i>Gone With the Wind, </i>spoke the following concerning her frame of mind during the writing of her famous novel:</p>
<p><i>It was going along pretty well until somebody sent me a new book called </i>John Browns Body,<i> by Stephen Vincent Benet. When I finished reading that magnificent Civil War epic, I burst into tears and put my own manuscript away on a closet shelf. </i>John Browns Body <i>gave me such a terrible case of the humbles that it was months before I could find the necessary faith in myself and my book to go on.</i></p>
<p>Momentarily, Margaret Mitchell doubted herself too much to go on. As William Shakespeare put it, "Our doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft might win, By fearing to attempt" (<i>Measure for Measure, </i>act I, sc. 4, lines 7779).</p>
<p>My student John saw his crumpled-up paper and visualized failure. He didnt even want to try. But Bart taped his name to his desk and kept his eye on how it would look when written correctly and then marked his progress.</p>
<p>Our Savior is the perfect image for us to visualize as we strive to be successful. We need to tape his image on the pages of our lives so that we may visualize his perfect life as we lift ourselves up from our failures. That we may mark our progress as we learn from our mistakes is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Music has always been a very important part of my life. Nearly every major memory of my childhood involves music of some kind: singing with my family on road trips to pass the time; learning barbershop music with my mom and sisters; listening to the Tijuana Brass band on the record player while decorating our Christmas tree; singing my fathers favorite song, "Love at Home" (see Hymns, 2002, no. 294), for family home evening; and admiring my mother as she played the organ in our sacrament meeting every week - something she still does at the young age of eighty. Given that music played such a prominent role in my youth, it will not surprise you to know that I took piano lessons for ten years, from the age of eight to seventeen.
My first piano teacher - we will call her Mrs. Smith - was very strict and had high expectations for mastery. During my lesson she would often follow the music with a pencil as I played. Sometimes, after I hit a sour note or used the wrong fingering, Mrs. Smith would flick my fingers with that pencil. She intended to help me recognize the mistake so that I could correct it. Unfortunately, after several experiences with the dreaded pencil, I learned that the least painful way to handle my musical mistakes was to remove my hands from the keys as quickly as possible.
This habit of abruptly stopping after a mistake was also unintentionally reinforced when I would practice at home. Our piano was positioned on a wall that was opposite our kitchen; in fact, it was back-to-back with our stove. I would often practice while my mother was making dinner on the other side of the wall. When I would make a mistake, she would make a staccato "ah" sound. Startled, my hands would fly from the keys.
I know this was not the intended outcome because I heard her do the same thing when she made her own mistakes at the organ or piano. She still does this today, but only in practice. When she is at the organ or piano for performance, there are few errors, but when they occur, they are hardly noticeable. She can play right on through a mistake like nothing happened. I, on the other hand, cannot.
Most of my piano recitals with Mrs. Smith took place in the chapel of my home ward building. These were reverent occasions - no clapping after the end of each performance, just polite smiles from the audience as we each took our turn at the grand piano. We were not allowed to use our music, so for me, the walk up those three velvety red steps to the piano felt like walking into a battle unarmed. I was terrified that I would make a mistake, take my hands from the keys, and be unable to find the right placement again.
This terror of performing would follow me into adulthood. When I was still in the early years of my public accounting career and had two small children at home, I was called as the Relief Society pianist.
The first week was a disaster. I lur</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. It is an honor to stand before you this day, and it is an honor to teach at this great university. I have long pondered the message I would share today, and I have looked forward to this day with apprehension - praying that I will say those things that will be of most benefit to you. This opportunity to speak to you has been overwhelming and humbling, to say the least, and I have taken courage from the words of King David to his son Solomon in 1 Chronicles 28:20:
Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.
Knowledge and Intelligence
I love coming to campus each fall. I can feel of your knowledge and intelligence - I find it invigorating. In Doctrine and Covenants 93:30 we read, "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence." In Doctrine and Covenants 93:36 the Lord clarifies the meaning of intelligence: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." We have been instructed in Doctrine and Covenants 88:118, "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." What does this mean for you and me? In my mind this translates to my being diligent in pursuing knowledge and being obedient in applying my learning to righteous purposes as I exercise faith.
President Brigham Young taught:
We . . . keep learning, and we do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information. That may appear a strange idea to some; but it is for the plain and simple reason that we are not capacitated to receive all knowledge at once. We must therefore receive a little here and a little there.1
In other words, the work of knowledge and, subsequently, intelligence is developmental and ongoing throughout our lives. We begin our learning as an infant, and personal development is ongoing.
One of my favorite growth and development theories comes from a well-known psychologist, Erik Erikson. Dr. Erikson maintains that an individuals development occurs throughout the span of life. He outlined a theory known as the eight stages of psychosocial development. This is a theory that I have found enlightening, especially considering our understanding that Heavenly Fathers plan for us is developmental. I have implemented aspects of this theory into my daily interactions, not only as a professional but also as a wife, mother, friend, daughter, and neighbor.
According to Erikson, during the course of our lifetime, each one of us mov</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is always an exciting and satisfying opportunity to greet you at the beginning of a new semester. In my long experience of school beginnings, I have concluded that while all are positive in the sense that there has been yet little time for anything serious to go wrong, each new term is different in some ways from any other. This fall at BYU, for example, we have fewer first-year young men and fewer second-year young women as a result of the change in missionary ages announced by President Thomas S. Monson last October. I dont know what next year will bring, but in two years we will have more returned missionaries than ever before just starting their BYU careers.
To all of you I add my welcome and express my appreciation that you are here, whether for the first time or continuing your educational quests. And for those of you back from missionary or military service, a special greeting is in order. Likewise, we appreciate our nontraditional and bachelor of general studies students being with us.
This past July, on the way to a family excursion with my siblings and their spouses, Sharon and I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London, England, the morning after Andy Murray, a native Scotsman and British hero, won the Wimbledon tennis tournament. This major event in international professional tennis had not been won by a Brit in seventy-seven years before Murrays exciting victory. The UK media were filled with accounts of his dramatic win, and there seemed to be a national celebration over the outcome of this tennis match. Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought Andy should be knighted, although Murray himself reported he didnt think that was necessarily merited. His picture was on the front page of every newspaper, and, I am told, his success was the lead story on television for a few days.
This national pride is perhaps understandable and maybe even laudatory. What I found interesting was that there was little, if any, mention made of his serving faults, unforced errors, or games lost or any of the particularly excellent points scored by his opponent. The entire story would seem, if you didnt look at the match statistics closely, like a perfectly executed victory that was never in doubt.
The thought occurred to me that perhaps winning Wimbledon or another sporting contest is more like successfully completing the game of life or our BYU education than any of us might really expect. What I mean by this is that I believe the plan of salvation makes it possible for all of us - when we have tried to live our lives the best we can and have worked to overcome our mistakes and repent of our sins - to come to the Final Judgment or graduation and have the wonderful pronouncement made to us of "well done, thou good and faithful servant" (Matthew 25:21).
You might be thinking, "What has this to do with my work and study here at BYU?" That is a very good question. Because of my own experience and als</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">President Samuelson, members of the board of trustees, administrators, faculty, guests, and especially graduates, weve made it! Were graduating from Brigham Young University, and today we are here to celebrate our success.
In fact, one of the most important lessons Ive learned in my time at BYU is to view success differently. Ive learned that life demands high effort from everyone all the time but does so in two general forms, either of which can result in success.
The first form Im going to call "climbing." This describes times in life in which one must devote high effort to developing talents, maximizing opportunities, and realizing potential. Climbing is characterized by persistence and self-motivation and generally results in achievements that our society applauds and actively tracks - resume items, of which receiving a college education is but one example. Most often when we imagine a "successful" person, we think of someone who has climbed.
I have come to better understand another form of success. Where success means the favorable ending of a situation requiring effort, I contest that in many cases enduring or merely surviving is succeeding. With permission, I want to share the story of one of my good friends. For some time now I have watched this friend struggle with major organ failure. Every semester she registers for classes, becomes severely ill, and is forced to withdraw. She has waited and waited on a transplant list. This year she received a transplant and returned ready to dive into classes at last. Then complications arose, and she learned of a mistake in how the new organ was attached. Now she is waiting on the transplant list again.
