  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Happy August 2nd! Some of you may be celebrating a birthday today. If so, you join the likes of Rembrandt’s wife, Saskia, who was born in 1612; Irish actor Peter O’Toole, born in 1932; and Andrew Gold, born in 1951. He wrote the song “Thank You for Being a Friend,” which became the theme song for that popular TV series in the eighties called &lt;i&gt;The Golden Girls.&lt;/i&gt;

For others, however, today is one of sadness and reflection as they remember and honor someone who died. Some who passed away on August 2nd include Wild Bill Hickok, who died in 1876; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, in 1921; Alexander Graham Bell, in 1922; and, in 1998, the American ventriloquist and puppeteer, Shari Lewis (remember Lamb Chop?).

Well, like any good librarian, I did not stop there! After some additional research, I discovered that in 1776 the Declaration of Independence was actually signed on August 2nd (not July 4th, like most of us think!); in 1790 the first U.S. census was conducted; and in 1870 the Tower Subway, the world’s first underground tube, opened in London. These are all good things, but August 2nd also had its share of tragedy. In 1922 a typhoon hit China, killing more than 50,000 people; in 1934 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany; in 1968 an earthquake shook the Philippines, killing 270 people and wounding nearly 300; in 1973 a flash fire killed fifty-one at the Summerland amusement center at Douglas on the Isle of Man; and in 1980 a bomb exploded at a railway station in Bologna, Italy, killing eighty-five people and wounding more than 200.

I next wondered what notable August 2nd events we have as Latter-day Saints and found that in 1831, Joseph Smith, who had traveled to Missouri for the first time, met with others on today’s date to begin the building of yet another new settlement for the outcast Saints. Our Prophet recorded:

&lt;i&gt;I assisted the Colesville branch of the Church to lay the first log, for a house, as a foundation of Zion in Kaw township, twelve miles west of Independence. The log was carried and placed by twelve men, in honor of the twelve tribes of Israel. At the same time, through prayer, the land of Zion was consecrated and dedicated by Elder Sidney Rigdon for the gathering of the Saints.&lt;/i&gt;

He concluded:

&lt;i&gt;It was &lt;/i&gt;a season of joy &lt;i&gt;to those present, and &lt;/i&gt;afforded a glimpse of the future,&lt;i&gt; which time will yet unfold to the satisfaction of the faithful.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 1:196; emphasis added]

It was “a season of joy” and “afforded a glimpse of the future.” Keep that thought!

Just two years later, on August 2, 1833, a revelation was given through Joseph Smith at Kirtland, Ohio. At that time members of the Church were being persecuted in Missouri, and the Prophet had been forced to sign an agreement in late July that the Saints would leave Jackson County. This revelation is section 97 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which gives beautiful insights into Zion and “the pure in heart” (verse 21) and instructions for building a temple, a house of the Lord.

LDS birthdays today include Matthew Cowley, born in 1897, apostle and great missionary to the Maori Saints.

Finally, I want to bring your attention to the fact that on August 2, 1985, our Church released the first new English hymnbook in thirty-seven years. This is the green hymnal, which replaced the navy one (for those of you who can remember that far back!). Since then, this hymnal has been translated into many languages and continues to be the one used today. (See “It Happened in August,” What’s Up? &lt;i&gt;New Era,&lt;/i&gt; August 2006, 36.) More on hymns to come! (Unless otherwise noted, all songs cited are from &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 2002.)

So why point out all of this? I hope you recognize that we could research any day of the year and come up with similar results. Every day is important, and we need to remember that good and bad things happen. In fact, I think sometimes the difference between a good day and a bad day is about twenty-four hours. Good and bad are part of life, part of the “opposition in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11) that Lehi discussed in his final words to his son Jacob. In Ecclesiastes 3:1–4 we read:

&lt;i&gt;To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.&lt;/i&gt;

I encourage all of us to savor every moment of every day and, on those bleak days when nothing seems to be going right, to think of hymn number 255 and “carry on!” (“Carry On”). Have that “season of joy” that affords “a glimpse of the future” that the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote about in his journal on August 2, 1831.

The hymn “Carry On” was written in response to the theme “Onward with Mormon Ideals” that was announced for the Mutual Improvement Association in 1930, the Church’s centennial year. This was an exciting time in the Church as members looked back over the first hundred years yet looked to the future as well.

We have so many examples of Saints who press forward with faith during trying times. Our dear President Gordon B. Hinckley put it this way:

&lt;i&gt;It isn’t as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don’t worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work out. If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us.&lt;/i&gt; [Quoted in “Excerpts from Addresses of President Gordon B. Hinckley,” Latter-day Counsel, &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; October 2000, 73; see also Hinckley, “Put Your Trust in God,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; February 2006, 63]

If President Hinckley needed to remind himself daily to carry on, then we probably need to be reminding ourselves even more.

I believe that carrying on is a tradition that gets passed down through the generations, and I have been blessed by the valiant examples of my ancestors. My paternal grandmother, Eliza Teuscher Bischoff, was born in Switzerland. She fell in love about the same time that she and her family met the Mormon missionaries. The entire family eventually joined the Church and started preparations to join the Saints in America. Margaritha, her sister, was especially thrilled and could not wait to go, but my grandmother was pulled in two directions; she wanted to go with her family, but she did not want to leave her sweetheart. She called it her time of sadness and joy. Just before the family was ready to leave, tragedy struck when Margaritha became ill and died. It is said that my great-grandmother’s hair turned white overnight. Nonetheless they followed through with their plans and sailed for America with heavy hearts.

Aunt Jo, from my mom’s side of our family, was a stalwart Saint who carried on even though that meant being disowned. Johanna Adrianna Gobel Tonks was raised in Holland. She and her sister had to hide their Book of Mormon under the mattress up in their attic bedroom. The oil for their little lamp would burn just long enough for the sisters to read one chapter of the book every night. Their mother, suspicious of all things Mormon, said one evening, “No more light for you girls up there.” Somehow Aunt Jo managed to get some matches, and she and her sister were able to continue reading that precious chapter nightly, even though the oil should have burned out long before. She stated, “No one in this whole wide world can tell me the hand of the Lord wasn’t over us.”

Aunt Jo could not get baptized until she turned 18, and that happened while her mother was away helping a sister. Aunt Jo recalled being discouraged, for she loved her mother and did not want to disobey her. She wondered if she was doing right in going against her mother’s wishes, but when she came up out of the water, she exclaimed, “Oh, I am so happy!” for the greatest feeling of joy came over her, and she was glad she had done the will of the Father.

When her mother came home one week later, Aunt Jo met her at the depot, and during their late-night supper her mother said, “Jo, you have come of age while I was gone. What have you done?”

Aunt Jo answered, “Well, mother, I have been baptized, but let me stay here and live with you. You can go to your church and I can go to mine. I want to stay and take care of you.”

Her mother replied, “I cannot live with a Mormon. You leave the house now.”

It was 11:00 p.m. and raining terribly. That did not make any difference to her mother, however, and Aunt Jo had to walk twenty minutes to stay with an aunt, never to return to her home again.

Oh, how I love these stories of pressing forward with faith during trying times.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Become an Instrument in the Lord’s Hands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the first poems I memorized is the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:

&lt;i&gt;Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where there is hatred, let me sow love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where there is injury, pardon.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where there is doubt, faith.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where there is despair, hope.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where there is darkness, light.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where there is sadness, joy.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;O Divine Master,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;grant that I may not so much seek&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to be consoled as to console;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to be understood as to understand;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to be loved as to love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For it is in giving that we receive;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.&lt;/i&gt;
[Attributed]

This simple prayer contains profound truths. The imagery of becoming an instrument in the Lord’s hands is beautiful, and it is my first guideline for carrying on. This has become my motto.

I sang a setting of this poem at a BYU commencement back in the eighties. Often I find myself humming this song to remind me of the good I can do in the world today (see “Have I Done Any Good?” no. 223).

In recent years I have learned a lot about musical instruments. My husband, Daron, is a professional musician. He gets asked on occasion to acquire a new instrument for a recording gig, so we are usually on the lookout for something to complement his current lineup that now numbers 118!

Primarily we own wind instruments—like clarinets, flutes, saxophones, recorders, and some pretty cool ethnic ones—but we also have a nice piano, some keyboards, a couple of organs, guitars, a ukulele, and even some kazoos. Some are very big, like the baritone saxophone; others are very small, like the Oscar Meyer Wienerwhistle. No two are alike; each one is unique. They sound great, but it takes some effort to keep them playable. They must be kept clean, tuned, and regulated. Pads must be level, joints lubricated, endless reeds fixed and conditioned, wood bodies humidified, and silver bodies kept free of tarnish. So, too, must we keep ourselves in top condition to be directed by the Heavenly Maestro.

Mary Ellen Smoot said in the October 2000 general conference:

&lt;i&gt;Truly, we may &lt;/i&gt;each&lt;i&gt; be an instrument in the hands of God. Happily, we need not all be the same kind of instrument. Just as the instruments in an orchestra differ in size, shape, and sound, we too are different from one another. We have different talents and inclinations, but just as the French horn cannot duplicate the sound of the piccolo, neither is it necessary for us to all serve the Lord in the same way.&lt;/i&gt; [“We Are Instruments in the Hands of God,”&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2000, 90; emphasis in original]

This is an important point. The Lord needs you to do it in your own way, using your own talents and your unique individual caring. Remember:

&lt;i&gt;Angels above us are silent notes taking&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Of ev’ry action; then do what is right!&lt;/i&gt;
[“Do What Is Right,” no. 237]

No one else can do what you can do. Please do not compare yourselves to others. Rather, bloom where you’re planted! This is one of the lessons I learned from growing up in a very small farming community. Of course at the time I felt rather put upon because of all the chores and responsibilities this afforded. I wondered each time we left events early to “go home and milk” why I couldn’t stay like my city cousins. Their life looked so much easier. But looks can be deceiving. Do not seek for greener grass or covet what is thy neighbor’s. This is something my parents taught me: learn to be content where you are.

I also learned about service and how to be an instrument in the Lord’s hands by observing my parents and their selfless acts of kindness to neighbor and stranger alike. It was common for my mom to feed a hobo passing by or to fix dinner for a needy family or to go visit someone “just because.” My dad was always first in line to help put up hay or to fill up someone’s gas tank because of miscalculated mileage to the next gas station. He was especially good at listening and lifting others’ souls. He gave hope where there was despair and lightened many heavy burdens with his humor and kindness. He loved the Charlie Chaplin song &lt;i&gt;Smile,&lt;/i&gt;which actually is a great carry-on song:

&lt;i&gt;Light up your face with gladness,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hide ev’ry trace of sadness,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Al-’tho a tear may be ever so near,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That’s the time,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You must keep on trying,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Smile, what’s the use of crying,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You’ll find that life is still worth-while&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If you just smile.&lt;/i&gt;
[Charles “Charlie” Chaplin, music (theme for &lt;i&gt;Modern Times,&lt;/i&gt; 1936); John Turner and Geoffrey Claremont Parsons, lyrics and title (1954)]

Sometimes we question our promptings because of what I call the “smallness factor.” We think that because the Lord wants us to do just a tiny thing that it is not important. This is wrong. Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, former general Relief Society president, counseled:

&lt;i&gt;What does it mean to be an instrument in everyday terms? I think it means to nurture others. Joseph Smith called it acting “according to those sympathies” in our hearts. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Believe me when I say each of us is much better than we think. We need to recognize and celebrate what we’re doing right. Much of what we do seems small and insignificant—just a part of daily living. When we are called “to give an account to Jehovah,” as the Prophet Joseph counseled, I know that we will have much to share.&lt;/i&gt; [“Sweet Moments,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2005, 107; see Relief Society Minutes, 28 April 1842, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38 and also 34]

Carrying on is about being consistent—line upon line, precept upon precept. Testimonies are built one step at a time.

In his 2006 October general conference address, Elder Don R. Clarke, then of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, spoke about becoming instruments in the Lord’s hands. One story is so tenderly told that I want to quote it. He began:

&lt;i&gt;My maternal grandfather, Alma Benjamin Larsen, was only 34 years old when he woke up one morning and noticed that he had problems seeing. Shortly thereafter, he lost his sight entirely. Grandfather had served a mission and been a faithful member of the Church. He was a farmer with a wife and three children, and he could not imagine life without sight. Grandfather’s wife and small children now had to bear the extra burdens of helping on the farm, and money became tight.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;During this time of physical darkness, many people became instruments in God’s hands to help my blind grandfather. One experience that had a powerful impact on his family happened in 1919. It was a year of great financial difficulty for all the people in Grandfather’s town. Farms were being foreclosed, and businesses were going broke. There was a sizable mortgage on his farm, and Grandfather received a statement saying he would have to pay $195 in order to carry the mortgage over for another year. For him, paying this bill was like demanding a pound of flesh. Nearly everyone was in the same condition, and it seemed impossible to obtain that much money. If he had gathered everything that the farm produced—the horses, cows, and machinery—he could not have sold them for $195. Grandfather asked a neighbor to butcher two or three of his cows, and he sold them and some other products. He had extended credit to his neighbors with the understanding that they would pay at the end of the year, but none of his debtors was able to pay him. The economic situation for his family was bleak.&lt;/i&gt;

Elder Clarke quoted from his grandfather’s journal:

&lt;i&gt;“I shall never forget that cold evening, just before Christmas of 1919. It looked as though we would lose the farm. My daughter, Gladys, laid a slip of paper in my hand and said, ‘This came in the mail today.’ I took it to her mother and asked her what it was. This is what my wife read to me, ‘Dear Brother Larsen, I’ve had you on my mind all day today. I am wondering if you are in financial trouble. If you are, I have $200 you may have.’ The letter was signed ‘Jim Drinkwater.’ Jim was a small, crippled man, and he would have been the last man on earth that anyone would have thought had that much money on hand. I went to his house that night and he said, ‘Brother Larsen, I received a wireless message from heaven this morning, and I could not get you off my mind all day. I was sure you were in financial trouble.’ Brother Drinkwater gave me $200 and we sent the $195 to the mortgage company, and with the extra $5 we bought boots and clothes for the children. Santa Claus did come that year.”&lt;/i&gt;

Elder Clarke’s grandfather then bore his testimony:

&lt;i&gt;“The Lord has never let me down. He has touched the hearts of others as He touched the heart of Brother Drinkwater. I bear witness that the only safety and security that I have ever found has come through trying to keep the commandments of the Lord and upholding and sustaining the authorities of this Church.”&lt;/i&gt;

Elder Clarke then concluded:

&lt;i&gt;I have thought about Jim Drinkwater many times and wondered how he came to be one that the Lord could trust. Jim was a little, crippled man that God trusted to help a blind farmer with a heavy mortgage and three children. I have learned a great deal from my grandfather’s experience with Jim Drinkwater. I have learned that a person does not need to have a Church calling, an invitation to help someone, or even good health to become an instrument in God’s hands.&lt;/i&gt; [Don R. Clarke, “Becoming Instruments in the Hands of God,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2006, 97–98]

My young brothers and sisters, strive to be someone the Lord can trust. Always be listening for that still small voice. Have you received “a wireless message from heaven” today? President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave this advice in the April 2011 general conference:

&lt;i&gt;Often&lt;/i&gt; [the Lord] &lt;i&gt;speaks to us in ways that we can hear only with our heart. To better hear His voice, it would be wise to turn down the volume control of the worldly noise in our lives. If we ignore or block out the promptings of the Spirit for whatever reason, they become less noticeable until we cannot hear them at all. Let us learn to hearken to the promptings of the Spirit and then be eager to heed them.&lt;/i&gt; [“Waiting on the Road to Damascus,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt;May 2011, 70–75]

As we help others carry on, our own burdens get lighter. Become an instrument in God’s hands.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Hymn a Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Another suggestion for carrying on is to include the study of hymns in your daily personal worship time. Have you read what the First Presidency recommends in the preface to the hymnbook?

&lt;i&gt;The hymns can greatly benefit us as individuals. Hymns can lift our spirits, give us courage, and move us to righteous action. They can fill our souls with heavenly thoughts and bring us a spirit of peace.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.&lt;/i&gt; [“First Presidency Preface,” &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 2002, x]

I love the hymns! They are truly “song[s] of the heart” (D&amp;amp;C 25:12), and I highly encourage you to turn to them for inspiration. Each is a mini-sermon that can build testimony, strengthen resolves, and help us &lt;i&gt;carry on.&lt;/i&gt; My own gospel convictions have developed and become stronger through the years as I have pondered their messages. I share a few personal experiences to illustrate the power of our hymns and hope as I do that you will recall your own teaching moments.

My first favorite was “There Is a Green Hill Far Away.” The simplicity of this text gave me a basic, childlike understanding of the unconditional love of our Savior:

&lt;i&gt;Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And we must love him too,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And trust in his redeeming blood,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And try his works to do.&lt;/i&gt;
[No. 194]

As a teen I participated in a dance festival at the annual June conference in Salt Lake City. This was so fun for me—a farm girl who came to the big city to participate with hundreds of other youth in a spectacular event at the football stadium at the U. After the finale, as we dancers learned that the prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, was there, everyone spontaneously began to sing “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet” (no. 19). My voice broke as the Spirit bore witness to me that we do have a living prophet, and this feeling has come again and again as I have had opportunities to see prophets in person—not on TV but here at BYU or in the LDS Conference Center. I do give thanks for a prophet who guides us in these latter days!

I went to Ricks College (now BYU–Idaho) and attended the weekly devotionals. One particular day I was feeling a bit depressed—just sort of sad and wondering where my life was going—as I trudged into the meeting. I do not remember who spoke that day, but I do remember singing hymn number 250, “We Are All Enlisted.” Verse three was particularly poignant:

&lt;i&gt;Fighting for a kingdom, and the world is our foe;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Happy are we! Happy are we!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Glad to join the army, we will sing as we go;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We shall gain the vict’ry by and by.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dangers may gather—why should we fear?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jesus, our Leader, ever is near.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He will protect us, comfort and cheer.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We’re joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.&lt;/i&gt;

As these words entered my sad heart that morning, I immediately felt buoyed up and happy to be part of God’s army.

On my mission I had a goal to memorize as many hymns as possible. Hymn number 29, “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief,” was one of the first. As you know, this is the hymn that John Taylor sang for Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum that fateful day in June 1844 at Carthage. John Taylor recalled:

&lt;i&gt;All of us felt unusually . . . languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits. In consonance with those feelings I sang a song, that had lately been introduced into Nauvoo, entitled, “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.” . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . After a lapse of some time, Brother Hyrum requested me again to sing that song. I replied, “Brother Hyrum, I do not feel like singing,” when he remarked, “Oh, never mind; commence singing, and you will get the spirit of it.” At his request I did so.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 7:101–2]

This was a carry-on moment!

It took me longer than most to marry. On occasion I thought I might be that stereotypical “old-maid” librarian! Turning to the hymns on many lonely evenings lifted my spirits and helped me to maintain eternal perspective. Where could I turn for peace? Where was my solace? Where was “the quiet hand to calm my anguish? Who, who [could] understand? He, only One” (“Where Can I Turn for Peace?” no. 129).

In May 2002 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. About a month later my father had a stroke and died within a week on July 3rd. This, indeed, was a time I needed strength to carry on. Hymn number 115 gave me hope:

&lt;i&gt;Here bring your wounded hearts; here tell your anguish.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Earth has no sorrow that heav’n cannot heal.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Earth has no sorrow but heav’n can remove.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Come, Ye Disconsolate”]

I suspect that each of you has experienced similar soul-searching times, and I testify that the hymns can heal our wounded hearts and bring solace. They can also move us to action. Our dear prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, said:

&lt;i&gt;My brothers and sisters, may we resolve from this day forward to fill our hearts with love. May we go the extra mile to include in our lives any who are lonely or downhearted or who are suffering in any way. May we “[cheer] up the sad and [make] someone feel glad”&lt;/i&gt; [“Have I Done Any Good?” no. 223]. &lt;i&gt;May we live so that when that final summons is heard, we may have no serious regrets, no unfinished business, but will be able to say with the Apostle Paul, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith”&lt;/i&gt; [2 Timothy 4:7]. [“Now Is the Time,”&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2001, 61]

Daily hymns remind us how to live.

&lt;i&gt;We are sowing, daily sowing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Countless seeds of good and ill.&lt;/i&gt;
. . .
&lt;i&gt;By a whisper sow we blessings;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;By a breath we scatter strife.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In our words and thoughts and actions&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lie the seeds of death and life&lt;/i&gt;.
[“We Are Sowing,” no. 216]

&lt;i&gt;You can make the pathway bright,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Fill the soul with heaven’s light,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If there’s sunshine in your heart.&lt;/i&gt;
. . .
&lt;i&gt;You can live a happy life&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In this world of toil and strife,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If there’s sunshine in your heart.&lt;/i&gt;
[“You Can Make the Pathway Bright,” no. 228]

&lt;i&gt;Are you ever burdened with a load of care?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And you will be singing as the days go by.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Count Your Blessings,” no. 241]

&lt;i&gt;In the days of trial his Saints he will cheer.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Let Us All Press On,” no. 243]

&lt;i&gt;Improve each shining moment.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Improve the Shining Moments,” no. 226]

&lt;i&gt;And never stand still till the Master appear.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And our talents improve&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;By the patience of hope and the labor of love.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Come, Let Us Anew,” no. 217]

&lt;i&gt;Come unto him all ye depressed,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ye erring souls whose eyes are dim,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ye weary ones who long for rest.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Come unto him!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Come unto him!&lt;/i&gt;
[“Come unto Him,” no. 114]

It is my prayer that we can all stand “faithful and true” (“True to the Faith,” no. 254). I know that our Savior lives and that this is a gospel of joy.

&lt;i&gt;O youth of the noble birthright,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Carry on, carry on, carry on!&lt;/i&gt;
[“Carry On,” no. 255]

I say this in the sacred name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Happy August 2nd! Some of you may be celebrating a birthday today. If so, you join the likes of Rembrandt’s wife, Saskia, who was born in 1612; Irish actor Peter O’Toole, born in 1932; and Andrew Gold, born in 1951. He wrote the song “Thank You for Being a Friend,” which became the theme song for that popular TV series in the eighties called <i>The Golden Girls.</i></p>
<p>For others, however, today is one of sadness and reflection as they remember and honor someone who died. Some who passed away on August 2nd include Wild Bill Hickok, who died in 1876; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, in 1921; Alexander Graham Bell, in 1922; and, in 1998, the American ventriloquist and puppeteer, Shari Lewis (remember Lamb Chop?).</p>
<p>Well, like any good librarian, I did not stop there! After some additional research, I discovered that in 1776 the Declaration of Independence was actually signed on August 2nd (not July 4th, like most of us think!); in 1790 the first U.S. census was conducted; and in 1870 the Tower Subway, the world’s first underground tube, opened in London. These are all good things, but August 2nd also had its share of tragedy. In 1922 a typhoon hit China, killing more than 50,000 people; in 1934 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany; in 1968 an earthquake shook the Philippines, killing 270 people and wounding nearly 300; in 1973 a flash fire killed fifty-one at the Summerland amusement center at Douglas on the Isle of Man; and in 1980 a bomb exploded at a railway station in Bologna, Italy, killing eighty-five people and wounding more than 200.</p>
<p>I next wondered what notable August 2nd events we have as Latter-day Saints and found that in 1831, Joseph Smith, who had traveled to Missouri for the first time, met with others on today’s date to begin the building of yet another new settlement for the outcast Saints. Our Prophet recorded:</p>
<p><i>I assisted the Colesville branch of the Church to lay the first log, for a house, as a foundation of Zion in Kaw township, twelve miles west of Independence. The log was carried and placed by twelve men, in honor of the twelve tribes of Israel. At the same time, through prayer, the land of Zion was consecrated and dedicated by Elder Sidney Rigdon for the gathering of the Saints.</i></p>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<p><i>It was </i>a season of joy <i>to those present, and </i>afforded a glimpse of the future,<i> which time will yet unfold to the satisfaction of the faithful.</i> [<i>HC</i> 1:196; emphasis added]</p>
<p>It was “a season of joy” and “afforded a glimpse of the future.” Keep that thought!</p>
<p>Just two years later, on August 2, 1833, a revelation was given through Joseph Smith at Kirtland, Ohio. At that time members of the Church were being persecuted in Missouri, and the Prophet had been forced to sign an agreement in late July that the Saints would leave Jackson County. This revelation is section 97 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which gives beautiful insights into Zion and “the pure in heart” (verse 21) and instructions for building a temple, a house of the Lord.</p>
<p>LDS birthdays today include Matthew Cowley, born in 1897, apostle and great missionary to the Maori Saints.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to bring your attention to the fact that on August 2, 1985, our Church released the first new English hymnbook in thirty-seven years. This is the green hymnal, which replaced the navy one (for those of you who can remember that far back!). Since then, this hymnal has been translated into many languages and continues to be the one used today. (See “It Happened in August,” What’s Up? <i>New Era,</i> August 2006, 36.) More on hymns to come! (Unless otherwise noted, all songs cited are from <i>Hymns,</i> 2002.)</p>
<p>So why point out all of this? I hope you recognize that we could research any day of the year and come up with similar results. Every day is important, and we need to remember that good and bad things happen. In fact, I think sometimes the difference between a good day and a bad day is about twenty-four hours. Good and bad are part of life, part of the “opposition in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11) that Lehi discussed in his final words to his son Jacob. In Ecclesiastes 3:1–4 we read:</p>
<p><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br />
<i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</i><br />
<i>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</i><br />
<i>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</i></p>
<p>I encourage all of us to savor every moment of every day and, on those bleak days when nothing seems to be going right, to think of hymn number 255 and “carry on!” (“Carry On”). Have that “season of joy” that affords “a glimpse of the future” that the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote about in his journal on August 2, 1831.</p>
<p>The hymn “Carry On” was written in response to the theme “Onward with Mormon Ideals” that was announced for the Mutual Improvement Association in 1930, the Church’s centennial year. This was an exciting time in the Church as members looked back over the first hundred years yet looked to the future as well.</p>
<p>We have so many examples of Saints who press forward with faith during trying times. Our dear President Gordon B. Hinckley put it this way:</p>
<p><i>It isn’t as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don’t worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work out. If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us.</i> [Quoted in “Excerpts from Addresses of President Gordon B. Hinckley,” Latter-day Counsel, <i>Ensign,</i> October 2000, 73; see also Hinckley, “Put Your Trust in God,” <i>Ensign,</i> February 2006, 63]</p>
<p>If President Hinckley needed to remind himself daily to carry on, then we probably need to be reminding ourselves even more.</p>
<p>I believe that carrying on is a tradition that gets passed down through the generations, and I have been blessed by the valiant examples of my ancestors. My paternal grandmother, Eliza Teuscher Bischoff, was born in Switzerland. She fell in love about the same time that she and her family met the Mormon missionaries. The entire family eventually joined the Church and started preparations to join the Saints in America. Margaritha, her sister, was especially thrilled and could not wait to go, but my grandmother was pulled in two directions; she wanted to go with her family, but she did not want to leave her sweetheart. She called it her time of sadness and joy. Just before the family was ready to leave, tragedy struck when Margaritha became ill and died. It is said that my great-grandmother’s hair turned white overnight. Nonetheless they followed through with their plans and sailed for America with heavy hearts.</p>
<p>Aunt Jo, from my mom’s side of our family, was a stalwart Saint who carried on even though that meant being disowned. Johanna Adrianna Gobel Tonks was raised in Holland. She and her sister had to hide their Book of Mormon under the mattress up in their attic bedroom. The oil for their little lamp would burn just long enough for the sisters to read one chapter of the book every night. Their mother, suspicious of all things Mormon, said one evening, “No more light for you girls up there.” Somehow Aunt Jo managed to get some matches, and she and her sister were able to continue reading that precious chapter nightly, even though the oil should have burned out long before. She stated, “No one in this whole wide world can tell me the hand of the Lord wasn’t over us.”</p>
<p>Aunt Jo could not get baptized until she turned 18, and that happened while her mother was away helping a sister. Aunt Jo recalled being discouraged, for she loved her mother and did not want to disobey her. She wondered if she was doing right in going against her mother’s wishes, but when she came up out of the water, she exclaimed, “Oh, I am so happy!” for the greatest feeling of joy came over her, and she was glad she had done the will of the Father.</p>
<p>When her mother came home one week later, Aunt Jo met her at the depot, and during their late-night supper her mother said, “Jo, you have come of age while I was gone. What have you done?”</p>
<p>Aunt Jo answered, “Well, mother, I have been baptized, but let me stay here and live with you. You can go to your church and I can go to mine. I want to stay and take care of you.”</p>
<p>Her mother replied, “I cannot live with a Mormon. You leave the house now.”</p>
<p>It was 11:00 p.m. and raining terribly. That did not make any difference to her mother, however, and Aunt Jo had to walk twenty minutes to stay with an aunt, never to return to her home again.</p>
<p>Oh, how I love these stories of pressing forward with faith during trying times.</p>
<h2><b>Become an Instrument in the Lord’s Hands</b></h2>
<p>One of the first poems I memorized is the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:</p>
<p><i>Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.</i><br />
<i>Where there is hatred, let me sow love.</i><br />
<i>Where there is injury, pardon.</i><br />
<i>Where there is doubt, faith.</i><br />
<i>Where there is despair, hope.</i><br />
<i>Where there is darkness, light.</i><br />
<i>Where there is sadness, joy.</i></p>
<p><i>O Divine Master,</i><br />
<i>grant that I may not so much seek</i><br />
<i>to be consoled as to console;</i><br />
<i>to be understood as to understand;</i><br />
<i>to be loved as to love.</i><br />
<i>For it is in giving that we receive;</i><br />
<i>it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;</i><br />
<i>and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.</i><br />
[Attributed]</p>
<p>This simple prayer contains profound truths. The imagery of becoming an instrument in the Lord’s hands is beautiful, and it is my first guideline for carrying on. This has become my motto.</p>
<p>I sang a setting of this poem at a BYU commencement back in the eighties. Often I find myself humming this song to remind me of the good I can do in the world today (see “Have I Done Any Good?” no. 223).</p>
<p>In recent years I have learned a lot about musical instruments. My husband, Daron, is a professional musician. He gets asked on occasion to acquire a new instrument for a recording gig, so we are usually on the lookout for something to complement his current lineup that now numbers 118!</p>
<p>Primarily we own wind instruments—like clarinets, flutes, saxophones, recorders, and some pretty cool ethnic ones—but we also have a nice piano, some keyboards, a couple of organs, guitars, a ukulele, and even some kazoos. Some are very big, like the baritone saxophone; others are very small, like the Oscar Meyer Wienerwhistle. No two are alike; each one is unique. They sound great, but it takes some effort to keep them playable. They must be kept clean, tuned, and regulated. Pads must be level, joints lubricated, endless reeds fixed and conditioned, wood bodies humidified, and silver bodies kept free of tarnish. So, too, must we keep ourselves in top condition to be directed by the Heavenly Maestro.</p>
<p>Mary Ellen Smoot said in the October 2000 general conference:</p>
<p><i>Truly, we may </i>each<i> be an instrument in the hands of God. Happily, we need not all be the same kind of instrument. Just as the instruments in an orchestra differ in size, shape, and sound, we too are different from one another. We have different talents and inclinations, but just as the French horn cannot duplicate the sound of the piccolo, neither is it necessary for us to all serve the Lord in the same way.</i> [“We Are Instruments in the Hands of God,”<i>Ensign,</i> November 2000, 90; emphasis in original]</p>
<p>This is an important point. The Lord needs you to do it in your own way, using your own talents and your unique individual caring. Remember:</p>
<p><i>Angels above us are silent notes taking</i><br />
<i>Of ev’ry action; then do what is right!</i><br />
[“Do What Is Right,” no. 237]</p>
<p>No one else can do what you can do. Please do not compare yourselves to others. Rather, bloom where you’re planted! This is one of the lessons I learned from growing up in a very small farming community. Of course at the time I felt rather put upon because of all the chores and responsibilities this afforded. I wondered each time we left events early to “go home and milk” why I couldn’t stay like my city cousins. Their life looked so much easier. But looks can be deceiving. Do not seek for greener grass or covet what is thy neighbor’s. This is something my parents taught me: learn to be content where you are.</p>
<p>I also learned about service and how to be an instrument in the Lord’s hands by observing my parents and their selfless acts of kindness to neighbor and stranger alike. It was common for my mom to feed a hobo passing by or to fix dinner for a needy family or to go visit someone “just because.” My dad was always first in line to help put up hay or to fill up someone’s gas tank because of miscalculated mileage to the next gas station. He was especially good at listening and lifting others’ souls. He gave hope where there was despair and lightened many heavy burdens with his humor and kindness. He loved the Charlie Chaplin song <i>Smile,</i>which actually is a great carry-on song:</p>
<p><i>Light up your face with gladness,</i><br />
<i>Hide ev’ry trace of sadness,</i><br />
<i>Al-’tho a tear may be ever so near,</i></p>
<p><i>That’s the time,</i><br />
<i>You must keep on trying,</i><br />
<i>Smile, what’s the use of crying,</i><br />
<i>You’ll find that life is still worth-while</i><br />
<i>If you just smile.</i><br />
[Charles “Charlie” Chaplin, music (theme for <i>Modern Times,</i> 1936); John Turner and Geoffrey Claremont Parsons, lyrics and title (1954)]</p>
<p>Sometimes we question our promptings because of what I call the “smallness factor.” We think that because the Lord wants us to do just a tiny thing that it is not important. This is wrong. Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, former general Relief Society president, counseled:</p>
<p><i>What does it mean to be an instrument in everyday terms? I think it means to nurture others. Joseph Smith called it acting “according to those sympathies” in our hearts. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Believe me when I say each of us is much better than we think. We need to recognize and celebrate what we’re doing right. Much of what we do seems small and insignificant—just a part of daily living. When we are called “to give an account to Jehovah,” as the Prophet Joseph counseled, I know that we will have much to share.</i> [“Sweet Moments,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 2005, 107; see Relief Society Minutes, 28 April 1842, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 38 and also 34]</p>
<p>Carrying on is about being consistent—line upon line, precept upon precept. Testimonies are built one step at a time.</p>
<p>In his 2006 October general conference address, Elder Don R. Clarke, then of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, spoke about becoming instruments in the Lord’s hands. One story is so tenderly told that I want to quote it. He began:</p>
<p><i>My maternal grandfather, Alma Benjamin Larsen, was only 34 years old when he woke up one morning and noticed that he had problems seeing. Shortly thereafter, he lost his sight entirely. Grandfather had served a mission and been a faithful member of the Church. He was a farmer with a wife and three children, and he could not imagine life without sight. Grandfather’s wife and small children now had to bear the extra burdens of helping on the farm, and money became tight.</i></p>
<p><i>During this time of physical darkness, many people became instruments in God’s hands to help my blind grandfather. One experience that had a powerful impact on his family happened in 1919. It was a year of great financial difficulty for all the people in Grandfather’s town. Farms were being foreclosed, and businesses were going broke. There was a sizable mortgage on his farm, and Grandfather received a statement saying he would have to pay $195 in order to carry the mortgage over for another year. For him, paying this bill was like demanding a pound of flesh. Nearly everyone was in the same condition, and it seemed impossible to obtain that much money. If he had gathered everything that the farm produced—the horses, cows, and machinery—he could not have sold them for $195. Grandfather asked a neighbor to butcher two or three of his cows, and he sold them and some other products. He had extended credit to his neighbors with the understanding that they would pay at the end of the year, but none of his debtors was able to pay him. The economic situation for his family was bleak.</i></p>
<p>Elder Clarke quoted from his grandfather’s journal:</p>
<p><i>“I shall never forget that cold evening, just before Christmas of 1919. It looked as though we would lose the farm. My daughter, Gladys, laid a slip of paper in my hand and said, ‘This came in the mail today.’ I took it to her mother and asked her what it was. This is what my wife read to me, ‘Dear Brother Larsen, I’ve had you on my mind all day today. I am wondering if you are in financial trouble. If you are, I have $200 you may have.’ The letter was signed ‘Jim Drinkwater.’ Jim was a small, crippled man, and he would have been the last man on earth that anyone would have thought had that much money on hand. I went to his house that night and he said, ‘Brother Larsen, I received a wireless message from heaven this morning, and I could not get you off my mind all day. I was sure you were in financial trouble.’ Brother Drinkwater gave me $200 and we sent the $195 to the mortgage company, and with the extra $5 we bought boots and clothes for the children. Santa Claus did come that year.”</i></p>
<p>Elder Clarke’s grandfather then bore his testimony:</p>
<p><i>“The Lord has never let me down. He has touched the hearts of others as He touched the heart of Brother Drinkwater. I bear witness that the only safety and security that I have ever found has come through trying to keep the commandments of the Lord and upholding and sustaining the authorities of this Church.”</i></p>
<p>Elder Clarke then concluded:</p>
<p><i>I have thought about Jim Drinkwater many times and wondered how he came to be one that the Lord could trust. Jim was a little, crippled man that God trusted to help a blind farmer with a heavy mortgage and three children. I have learned a great deal from my grandfather’s experience with Jim Drinkwater. I have learned that a person does not need to have a Church calling, an invitation to help someone, or even good health to become an instrument in God’s hands.</i> [Don R. Clarke, “Becoming Instruments in the Hands of God,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 97–98]</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, strive to be someone the Lord can trust. Always be listening for that still small voice. Have you received “a wireless message from heaven” today? President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave this advice in the April 2011 general conference:</p>
<p><i>Often</i> [the Lord] <i>speaks to us in ways that we can hear only with our heart. To better hear His voice, it would be wise to turn down the volume control of the worldly noise in our lives. If we ignore or block out the promptings of the Spirit for whatever reason, they become less noticeable until we cannot hear them at all. Let us learn to hearken to the promptings of the Spirit and then be eager to heed them.</i> [“Waiting on the Road to Damascus,” <i>Ensign,</i>May 2011, 70–75]</p>
<p>As we help others carry on, our own burdens get lighter. Become an instrument in God’s hands.</p>
<h2><b>A Hymn a Day</b></h2>
<p>Another suggestion for carrying on is to include the study of hymns in your daily personal worship time. Have you read what the First Presidency recommends in the preface to the hymnbook?</p>
<p><i>The hymns can greatly benefit us as individuals. Hymns can lift our spirits, give us courage, and move us to righteous action. They can fill our souls with heavenly thoughts and bring us a spirit of peace.</i></p>
<p><i>Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.</i> [“First Presidency Preface,” <i>Hymns,</i> 2002, x]</p>
<p>I love the hymns! They are truly “song[s] of the heart” (D&amp;C 25:12), and I highly encourage you to turn to them for inspiration. Each is a mini-sermon that can build testimony, strengthen resolves, and help us <i>carry on.</i> My own gospel convictions have developed and become stronger through the years as I have pondered their messages. I share a few personal experiences to illustrate the power of our hymns and hope as I do that you will recall your own teaching moments.</p>
<p>My first favorite was “There Is a Green Hill Far Away.” The simplicity of this text gave me a basic, childlike understanding of the unconditional love of our Savior:</p>
<p><i>Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!</i><br />
<i>And we must love him too,</i><br />
<i>And trust in his redeeming blood,</i><br />
<i>And try his works to do.</i><br />
[No. 194]</p>
<p>As a teen I participated in a dance festival at the annual June conference in Salt Lake City. This was so fun for me—a farm girl who came to the big city to participate with hundreds of other youth in a spectacular event at the football stadium at the U. After the finale, as we dancers learned that the prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, was there, everyone spontaneously began to sing “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet” (no. 19). My voice broke as the Spirit bore witness to me that we do have a living prophet, and this feeling has come again and again as I have had opportunities to see prophets in person—not on TV but here at BYU or in the LDS Conference Center. I do give thanks for a prophet who guides us in these latter days!</p>
<p>I went to Ricks College (now BYU–Idaho) and attended the weekly devotionals. One particular day I was feeling a bit depressed—just sort of sad and wondering where my life was going—as I trudged into the meeting. I do not remember who spoke that day, but I do remember singing hymn number 250, “We Are All Enlisted.” Verse three was particularly poignant:</p>
<p><i>Fighting for a kingdom, and the world is our foe;</i><br />
<i>Happy are we! Happy are we!</i><br />
<i>Glad to join the army, we will sing as we go;</i><br />
<i>We shall gain the vict’ry by and by.</i><br />
<i>Dangers may gather—why should we fear?</i><br />
<i>Jesus, our Leader, ever is near.</i><br />
<i>He will protect us, comfort and cheer.</i><br />
<i>We’re joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.</i></p>
<p>As these words entered my sad heart that morning, I immediately felt buoyed up and happy to be part of God’s army.</p>
<p>On my mission I had a goal to memorize as many hymns as possible. Hymn number 29, “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief,” was one of the first. As you know, this is the hymn that John Taylor sang for Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum that fateful day in June 1844 at Carthage. John Taylor recalled:</p>
<p><i>All of us felt unusually . . . languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits. In consonance with those feelings I sang a song, that had lately been introduced into Nauvoo, entitled, “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.” . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . After a lapse of some time, Brother Hyrum requested me again to sing that song. I replied, “Brother Hyrum, I do not feel like singing,” when he remarked, “Oh, never mind; commence singing, and you will get the spirit of it.” At his request I did so.</i> [<i>HC</i> 7:101–2]</p>
<p>This was a carry-on moment!</p>
<p>It took me longer than most to marry. On occasion I thought I might be that stereotypical “old-maid” librarian! Turning to the hymns on many lonely evenings lifted my spirits and helped me to maintain eternal perspective. Where could I turn for peace? Where was my solace? Where was “the quiet hand to calm my anguish? Who, who [could] understand? He, only One” (“Where Can I Turn for Peace?” no. 129).</p>
<p>In May 2002 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. About a month later my father had a stroke and died within a week on July 3rd. This, indeed, was a time I needed strength to carry on. Hymn number 115 gave me hope:</p>
<p><i>Here bring your wounded hearts; here tell your anguish.</i></p>
<p><i>Earth has no sorrow that heav’n cannot heal.</i></p>
<p><i>. . .</i></p>
<p><i>Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing</i><br />
<i>Earth has no sorrow but heav’n can remove.</i><br />
[“Come, Ye Disconsolate”]</p>
<p>I suspect that each of you has experienced similar soul-searching times, and I testify that the hymns can heal our wounded hearts and bring solace. They can also move us to action. Our dear prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, said:</p>
<p><i>My brothers and sisters, may we resolve from this day forward to fill our hearts with love. May we go the extra mile to include in our lives any who are lonely or downhearted or who are suffering in any way. May we “[cheer] up the sad and [make] someone feel glad”</i> [“Have I Done Any Good?” no. 223]. <i>May we live so that when that final summons is heard, we may have no serious regrets, no unfinished business, but will be able to say with the Apostle Paul, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith”</i> [2 Timothy 4:7]. [“Now Is the Time,”<i>Ensign,</i> November 2001, 61]</p>
<p>Daily hymns remind us how to live.</p>
<p><i>We are sowing, daily sowing</i><br />
<i>Countless seeds of good and ill.</i><br />
. . .<br />
<i>By a whisper sow we blessings;</i><br />
<i>By a breath we scatter strife.</i><br />
<i>In our words and thoughts and actions</i><br />
<i>Lie the seeds of death and life</i>.<br />
[“We Are Sowing,” no. 216]</p>
<p><i>You can make the pathway bright,</i><br />
<i>Fill the soul with heaven’s light,</i><br />
<i>If there’s sunshine in your heart.</i><br />
. . .<br />
<i>You can live a happy life</i><br />
<i>In this world of toil and strife,</i><br />
<i>If there’s sunshine in your heart.</i><br />
[“You Can Make the Pathway Bright,” no. 228]</p>
<p><i>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?</i><br />
<i>Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?</i><br />
<i>Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,</i><br />
<i>And you will be singing as the days go by.</i><br />
[“Count Your Blessings,” no. 241]</p>
<p><i>In the days of trial his Saints he will cheer.</i><br />
[“Let Us All Press On,” no. 243]</p>
<p><i>Improve each shining moment.</i><br />
[“Improve the Shining Moments,” no. 226]</p>
<p><i>And never stand still till the Master appear.</i><br />
<i>His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,</i><br />
<i>And our talents improve</i><br />
<i>By the patience of hope and the labor of love.</i><br />
[“Come, Let Us Anew,” no. 217]</p>
<p><i>Come unto him all ye depressed,</i><br />
<i>Ye erring souls whose eyes are dim,</i><br />
<i>Ye weary ones who long for rest.</i><br />
<i>Come unto him!</i><br />
<i>Come unto him!</i><br />
[“Come unto Him,” no. 114]</p>
<p>It is my prayer that we can all stand “faithful and true” (“True to the Faith,” no. 254). I know that our Savior lives and that this is a gospel of joy.</p>
<p><i>O youth of the noble birthright,</i><br />
<i>Carry on, carry on, carry on!</i><br />
[“Carry On,” no. 255]</p>
<p>I say this in the sacred name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of God’s greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a heart’s electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.
When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!
Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.
Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The heart’s valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!
In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.
It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.
In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israel’s new king. As he looked over each of Jesse’s sons, the Lord taught Samuel, “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).
Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had “a beautiful countenance” and that “the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]” (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).
In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. My thanks go to those who provided the music this morning. Their music has helped to bring the Spirit to this meeting. I would hope to speak by that Spirit today.
My late friend Robert J. Matthews, who taught religion here at BYU, used to say, “If I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, you will hear things better than I say them.” I pray that that can happen today.
I thought it appropriate to begin with a little poem written by a young man that I think might illustrate what sometimes may happen in parents’ attempts to change the behavior of their children. He wrote:
My parents told me not to smoke—
I don’t. 
Nor listen to a naughty joke—
I don’t. 
They made it plain I must not wink
At pretty girls, or even think
About intoxicating drink—
I don’t. 
To dance and flirt is very wrong—
I don’t. 
Wild youths chase women, wine and song—
I don’t. 
I kiss no girls, not even one—
I do not know how it is done—
You wouldn’t think I had much fun—
I DON’T. 
[“I Don’t,” Goldendale Sentinel (Klickatat County, Washington), 24 October 1918, 1, gld.stparchive.com/Archive/GLD/GLD10241918P01.php]
Now, you see that this young man’s behavior was changed, but not his attitude. What is needed is a change in attitude as well as behavior. So I pose this question: What causes a change in attitude and behavior?
President Boyd K. Packer stated:
True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. 
The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. . . . That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel. [“Little Children,” Ensign, November 1986, 17]
The purpose of my presentation today is to explore four points of doctrine as found in the scriptures and in the words of the Brethren.
Principle Number 1: Draw upon the Power of the Word Daily
The prophet Mormon wrote:
And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. [Alma 31:5]
When I taught seminary years ago, I wanted to show the youth the power of the word that Alma described. I wanted to show them that if they would make the word of God (as found in the scriptures) a part of their lives, it would change them. I didn’t know exactly how to do that, but I tried this way.
On the first day of class I gave them a blank sheet of paper and s</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.
I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.
I remember a saying that I heard once: “A good laugh a day keeps the blues away.” I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep life’s ups and downs in perspective and balance.
Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: “Hey, anybody got a straw?” Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation—especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that it’s all right, we understand, or we’re here to help.
In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that “a merry heart doeth good like a medicine.” If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, “be of good cheer” (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a res</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesn’t begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I can’t help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.
I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.
Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!
Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.
What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I don’t know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naïve sometimes about life. I can’t remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:
Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.
I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so m</span>
