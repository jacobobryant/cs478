  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am honored by the opportunity to speak to you today. I love to come to the BYU campus. I stand before you as “true blue.” As it has already been said, my shade of blue was painted in Cache Valley at Utah State University. My husband’s blue has a reddish tint and our children’s blues are of various hues. Yet when we see the color blue—any blue—we cheer.

There is something very stimulating about a university campus. Where there is a learning atmosphere there is energy, and increasing your knowledge is progressive. You are advancing on the path of life.

Now you may be puzzled at today’s devotional and may be asking, “What does the Primary general president have to say to me?” After all, many of you graduated from Primary years ago and have “put away [those] childish things.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Yet the messages and principles of the songs you sang in Primary still apply today and hopefully have remained in your heart.

Today we sang “I Will Follow God’s Plan.” We sang the words “My life is a gift; my life has a plan. My life has a purpose; in heav’n it began.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

As a student on this campus you are progressing with your plan. You have a purpose in mind. Can you see the Lord’s hand in your life? Can you see the path you took to get here?

I was born in Ogden, Utah, and grew up in Salt Lake City. At age eighteen, when I was about to leave to go to Utah State, my goals were simple. I really had just two. I’m going to be honest with you and tell you what they were: (1) I wanted to be an elementary school teacher, and (2) I wanted to fall in love. Now that seems simple, but I really did not think beyond those two goals. I hoped that somewhere out there was a handsome young man who also had the goal to stay on the path, get an education, and fall in love so we could marry, have a family, and bring children into this world. But I was anxious and nervous inside. What if my plan did not unfold &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; I wanted it to and &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; I wanted it to?

I was looking at the path through a magnifying glass, and all I could see were my shoelaces. I remembered those lessons in Primary about the plan of salvation. I could see the circles and the arrows on the chart, but I could not yet visualize myself in the plan. I wish I would have had the words to the chorus of this Primary song then. They read:

&lt;i&gt;I will follow God’s plan for me,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Holding fast to his word and his love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I will work, and I will pray;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I will always walk in his way.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Then I will be happy on earth&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And in my home above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

That is the key, and it is really quite simple: “I will follow &lt;i&gt;God’s plan &lt;/i&gt;for me.” And we do it by holding fast to His word, with His love, and through our prayers to Him while simply living life.

Brigham Young said, “Live so that the spirit of our religion [lives] within us.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; We are a making-and-keeping-covenants people, and nothing better shapes us than the sacred covenants we make to the Lord. We live these covenants when we follow His plan, and we come to know who we really are.

George Bernard Shaw said: “Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

That is true. I think of it this way: There are those who see themselves on this earth as simply growing up—helpless in a way. They eat, they sleep, and they live their lives. They watch themselves get taller and older. They let the world mold them and allow their circumstances to dictate their future. It is as if they are watching the wind swirl around a block of sandstone. The years go by until, finally, one day a shape is created. Or we can decide the kind of person we want to become, grip the chisel, and go to work. The sculpture being created is now of our creation. At times we may even stand back in awe at the form it is taking. The pinnacle of our reality is when we come to know we are not alone in our work. The real Artist is standing at our side, and His vision for this exquisite piece is beyond our comprehension.

Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin said:

&lt;i&gt;We see ourselves in terms of yesterday and today. Our Heavenly Father sees us in terms of forever. Although we might settle for less, Heavenly Father won’t, for He sees us as the glorious beings we are capable of becoming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

It is as if the Lord has given us tools with which to create this “being.” These tools are the covenants we make and keep, beginning with the baptismal covenant.

A covenant is personal. It is so personal that it is given to us individually, and often our very own name is said in conjunction with the ordinance that accompanies the covenant. By living our covenants with the Lord’s help, He sculpts us into a masterpiece.

Think of the baptismal covenant. Lately I have viewed the covenant of baptism through a granddaughter’s eyes. Lucy Catherine is three years old. In her world she is a princess. She is beginning this earthly path. I think she takes after her grandmother. Lucy is my buddy. She loves to climb up into my lap, and together we watch the Bible videos on my iPad. She can operate the iPad all by herself. Her favorite Bible video is of Jesus being baptized in the River Jordan.

Lucy is only three years old, but she feels something when she watches Jesus being baptized, and so do I.

Elder Robert D. Hales said: “Many members of the Church do not fully understand what happened when they went into the waters of baptism.” He then asked:

&lt;i&gt;Do&lt;/i&gt; [we] &lt;i&gt;understand . . . that when&lt;/i&gt; [we were] &lt;i&gt;baptized&lt;/i&gt; [we were] &lt;i&gt;changed forever? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Our baptism and confirmation is the gateway &lt;b&gt;into&lt;/b&gt; His kingdom. When we enter, we covenant to be &lt;b&gt;of&lt;/b&gt; His kingdom—forever!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

We see powerful evidences of the magnitude of the baptismal covenant in the history of the Church. In Liverpool, England, in the 1840s, George Cannon and his wife, Ann Quayle Cannon, were converted to the gospel. George wrote in a letter to his sister:

&lt;i&gt;I was sincerely desirous to lead a new life . . . ; and though slow of belief at first, and not seeing the necessity of baptism, yet God in His infinite mercy opened my eyes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

With the covenant of baptism and the promise of more covenants came the desire to join the Saints in America at all costs. Ann tucked a little money away each month so the family would have the funds necessary for the voyage.

&lt;i&gt;The wish to get to Zion became . . . a consuming desire. . . . She began to count the days that must elapse before the ship’s sailing. She was impressed that if this season . . . should pass and find the family still in England, she would not be alive to urge the journey another year. . . . She had a sure premonition that she should not live to reach the shores of America, and told her husband so.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

Ann was expecting their seventh child at the time, and George tried to persuade her to wait.

[But] &lt;i&gt;she refused absolutely—she would rather die in trying to go than live&lt;/i&gt; [by] &lt;i&gt;remaining. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Both&lt;/i&gt; [George and Ann] &lt;i&gt;prayed . . . that God’s blessing would attend them in doing what they believed to be His will.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

On September 17, 1842, George, Ann, and their six children boarded the ship and set sail for America. George later wrote:

&lt;i&gt;We are now launched on the bosom of the mighty deep, and sea-sickness has made the passengers for the most part very ill. My dear Ann is dreadfully affected with this nauseous sickness. . . . Yet I have never heard one complaint from her on her own account.&lt;/i&gt;[She] &lt;i&gt;regret&lt;/i&gt; [s] &lt;i&gt;. . . not being able to assist me in the care of the children.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

The days and weeks went by, and Ann only worsened. On October 28 she passed away. George wrote, “O God, how mysterious are Thy ways! Teach me resignation to Thy will!”&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Both George and Ann Quayle Cannon understood the promise “The Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm . . . in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; George and Ann Cannon lived their lives keeping their covenant of baptism and looking to the promise of more covenants while carving out a future for their posterity.

What did they clearly understand about the covenant of baptism? What was it that drove George and Ann to come to America at all costs? They were simply doing what they believed to be the Lord’s will.

Today we are not asked to move to Salt Lake City after our baptism. But we do enter into sacred covenants with God, and we promise to do three things:

• Take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ
• Keep His commandments
• Always remember Him

How can we take upon ourselves the name of Christ today? We do more than represent Him and follow Him: “We . . . see ourselves as His. We . . . put Him [and His work] first in our lives. We [seek] what He wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want.”&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

How can we live that baptismal promise in our daily lives here as students at BYU? It is a process, and oftentimes we wrestle to align our lives with the Father’s will. At times we may even question our judgment. We may rationalize our actions and say, “But others are doing it.” The choices we make follow us into our classrooms, in our conversations, with our callings, and on our dates. The results may alter how we dress, our appearance, what we text, the movies we see, and our very thoughts. When we seek His will, He will magnify our every effort to stay on the path back to Him. We need not ever feel alone. Be patient with yourself as you learn this process.

Our prayers may become different, and we may find ourselves asking, “What would Thou have me do?” and “Help me know what is Thy will.” We find ourselves stepping out of the boat, so to speak, to do His will. We prepare spiritually each day with personal prayers to Him, we read His words in the scriptures, and then we trust that He will guide us. His will then becomes ours.

Elder David A. Bednar said:

&lt;i&gt;You exercised your moral agency to accept the conditions of the baptismal covenant. . . . And as a representative of Jesus Christ, your life is no longer just about what you want but what God wants for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

Missionaries all over the world literally take upon themselves the name of Christ when they put on that missionary badge. We witnessed prophetic revelation last October 6 when President Thomas S. Monson announced the missionary age changes.&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; The response has been astounding. We are witnessing a modern-day miracle in these latter days.

Many of you have experienced a mission, and you know what it is like. It is not easy. When I served my first mission with my husband, in my first sentence in my first letter home to both our children and my parents, who had also served, I asked, “Why didn’t you tell me a mission was this hard?” When it becomes impossible to carry on, it is that covenant to do the Lord’s will that causes a missionary to find a private place and get on his or her knees. His or her prayer may be “I cannot do this alone. Only with Thee can I continue; only with Thee can I learn another language; and only with Thee can I teach those older, wiser, and more articulate than I.” A mission changes our life for the better because we take upon us His name.

&lt;b&gt;When we are baptized we covenant to keep His commandments. &lt;/b&gt;This commitment to come into God’s kingdom separates—but, as Elder Robert D. Hales notes, does not isolate&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;—us from the world as we “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; To stand as a witness includes everything we do and say.

In living the baptismal covenant we look for ways to keep the commandments rather than look for ways around them.

While I was visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina, I met Marianela, a frail, beautiful mother with two children, ages nine and twelve. All three had been baptized. Marianela was dealing with severe rheumatoid arthritis. She could only stand or lie down; she could not sit. At home she taught her children with what resources she had. She used both the scriptures and the Relief Society manual. I noticed those two books stacked neatly on her table. She wanted her children to keep the commandments and participate on Sunday and partake of the sacrament, so she accepted the invitation from the bishop’s wife to pick them up weekly. Marianela would ride to church lying down in the backseat of the car. It was her way of practicing obedience and aligning her heart with His. In Primary we sing the words “Keep the commandments! In this there is safety; in this there is peace.”&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; There was peace in Marianela’s home.

I saw another example of keeping the commandments in the Ilagan Stake in the Philippines. Just before a meeting I watched a large truck pull up to the chapel entrance. I could see the arms of the members reaching through the slats on the side of the truck to wave to others in the parking lot. The truck was covered with a canvas top. Out jumped numerous happy Filipinos—the men in their white shirts and ties and the women in their dresses. I learned they had ridden for hours to get there, bouncing on the wooden benches inside the truck. We all hurried into the building and sat down. I thought of their sacrifice to be there—and then the tears streamed down my face as they sang the opening song. With smiles they sang “Because I Have Been Given Much.”&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

Part of keeping the commandments is serving the Lord. President Lugo, the president of the Ilagan Stake, is a tiny little man with great faith. He has the image of the Savior in his countenance. I learned that he had been in a serious cycle accident and had been in the hospital. It was nearing the time in their stake for their yearly trip to the temple to do baptisms for the dead. He was devastated at the thought of not going with the youth, but he could not walk.

His wife said, “You cannot go. If you go, the youth would have to carry you, and that would be asking too much.”

President Lugo said, “If they will carry me into the temple, I will walk out.”

And that is exactly what he did. How can we possibly draw limits on our service to the Lord?

&lt;b&gt;As we keep our covenant to always remember the Lord, He will help us follow His plan. &lt;/b&gt;Let’s be honest: While trying to live our covenants, we sometimes get discouraged. We may see nothing but our imperfections. We may think our mistakes are impossible to repair, and we may think we cannot change. We may feel like we are failing.

As we chisel in the sandstone to create this new self, we sometimes chip off huge chunks of stone. Doing this may appear to disfigure our ultimate goal. Like Nephi, we may say, “O wretched man [or woman] that I am!”&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; We may lose hope, and we may fear that there is no way to repair our mistakes. But the real Artist, Jesus Christ, patiently and lovingly stands by our side and waits for us to ask for His help. He is ready to heal us. Then, like Nephi, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, we may ask:

&lt;i&gt;Wilt thou redeem my soul? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Wilt thou encircle me . . . in the robe of thy righteousness! . . . Wilt thou make my path straight before me! . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

One real blessing is that this Sunday we will again have the opportunity to renew the covenant we made at baptism as we partake of the sacrament with the glorious promise that we may always have His Spirit to be with us.

No wonder that when Romans 6 refers to baptism the scripture reads, “Walk in newness of life.”&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; That newness of life is the Atonement working within us, and we can experience it weekly. The Artist, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. “He was foreordained to carry out the Atonement—to come to the earth, suffer the penalty for our sins, die on the cross, and be resurrected.”&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; He will not halt the sculpturing process or put down the chisel until we are perfect and living in His presence. The Atonement is the supreme expression of the Savior’s love for the Father and for us.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

The sculptor Michelangelo, “when asked how he had produced the magnificent statue of an angel, . . . is reported to have simply replied, ‘I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.’”&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;

And so it is with the mutual efforts of a loving Savior and a covenant-keeping disciple on the path. The angel is within each one of us. Let us live the covenant we have made at baptism and seek to do His will. We will watch the plan He has masterfully created for each one of us take shape. Regardless of its form, we will stand in awe as the angel emerges, and we will give credit to our Savior Jesus Christ, for He is the perfect Artist.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I am honored by the opportunity to speak to you today. I love to come to the BYU campus. I stand before you as “true blue.” As it has already been said, my shade of blue was painted in Cache Valley at Utah State University. My husband’s blue has a reddish tint and our children’s blues are of various hues. Yet when we see the color blue—any blue—we cheer.</p>
<p>There is something very stimulating about a university campus. Where there is a learning atmosphere there is energy, and increasing your knowledge is progressive. You are advancing on the path of life.</p>
<p>Now you may be puzzled at today’s devotional and may be asking, “What does the Primary general president have to say to me?” After all, many of you graduated from Primary years ago and have “put away [those] childish things.”<sup>1</sup> Yet the messages and principles of the songs you sang in Primary still apply today and hopefully have remained in your heart.</p>
<p>Today we sang “I Will Follow God’s Plan.” We sang the words “My life is a gift; my life has a plan. My life has a purpose; in heav’n it began.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>As a student on this campus you are progressing with your plan. You have a purpose in mind. Can you see the Lord’s hand in your life? Can you see the path you took to get here?</p>
<p>I was born in Ogden, Utah, and grew up in Salt Lake City. At age eighteen, when I was about to leave to go to Utah State, my goals were simple. I really had just two. I’m going to be honest with you and tell you what they were: (1) I wanted to be an elementary school teacher, and (2) I wanted to fall in love. Now that seems simple, but I really did not think beyond those two goals. I hoped that somewhere out there was a handsome young man who also had the goal to stay on the path, get an education, and fall in love so we could marry, have a family, and bring children into this world. But I was anxious and nervous inside. What if my plan did not unfold <i>how</i> I wanted it to and <i>when</i> I wanted it to?</p>
<p>I was looking at the path through a magnifying glass, and all I could see were my shoelaces. I remembered those lessons in Primary about the plan of salvation. I could see the circles and the arrows on the chart, but I could not yet visualize myself in the plan. I wish I would have had the words to the chorus of this Primary song then. They read:</p>
<p><i>I will follow God’s plan for me,</i><br />
<i>Holding fast to his word and his love.</i><br />
<i>I will work, and I will pray;</i><br />
<i>I will always walk in his way.</i><br />
<i>Then I will be happy on earth</i><br />
<i>And in my home above.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>That is the key, and it is really quite simple: “I will follow <i>God’s plan </i>for me.” And we do it by holding fast to His word, with His love, and through our prayers to Him while simply living life.</p>
<p>Brigham Young said, “Live so that the spirit of our religion [lives] within us.”<sup>4</sup> We are a making-and-keeping-covenants people, and nothing better shapes us than the sacred covenants we make to the Lord. We live these covenants when we follow His plan, and we come to know who we really are.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw said: “Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.”<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>That is true. I think of it this way: There are those who see themselves on this earth as simply growing up—helpless in a way. They eat, they sleep, and they live their lives. They watch themselves get taller and older. They let the world mold them and allow their circumstances to dictate their future. It is as if they are watching the wind swirl around a block of sandstone. The years go by until, finally, one day a shape is created. Or we can decide the kind of person we want to become, grip the chisel, and go to work. The sculpture being created is now of our creation. At times we may even stand back in awe at the form it is taking. The pinnacle of our reality is when we come to know we are not alone in our work. The real Artist is standing at our side, and His vision for this exquisite piece is beyond our comprehension.</p>
<p>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin said:</p>
<p><i>We see ourselves in terms of yesterday and today. Our Heavenly Father sees us in terms of forever. Although we might settle for less, Heavenly Father won’t, for He sees us as the glorious beings we are capable of becoming.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>It is as if the Lord has given us tools with which to create this “being.” These tools are the covenants we make and keep, beginning with the baptismal covenant.</p>
<p>A covenant is personal. It is so personal that it is given to us individually, and often our very own name is said in conjunction with the ordinance that accompanies the covenant. By living our covenants with the Lord’s help, He sculpts us into a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Think of the baptismal covenant. Lately I have viewed the covenant of baptism through a granddaughter’s eyes. Lucy Catherine is three years old. In her world she is a princess. She is beginning this earthly path. I think she takes after her grandmother. Lucy is my buddy. She loves to climb up into my lap, and together we watch the Bible videos on my iPad. She can operate the iPad all by herself. Her favorite Bible video is of Jesus being baptized in the River Jordan.</p>
<p>Lucy is only three years old, but she feels something when she watches Jesus being baptized, and so do I.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales said: “Many members of the Church do not fully understand what happened when they went into the waters of baptism.” He then asked:</p>
<p><i>Do</i> [we] <i>understand . . . that when</i> [we were] <i>baptized</i> [we were] <i>changed forever? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Our baptism and confirmation is the gateway <b>into</b> His kingdom. When we enter, we covenant to be <b>of</b> His kingdom—forever!</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>We see powerful evidences of the magnitude of the baptismal covenant in the history of the Church. In Liverpool, England, in the 1840s, George Cannon and his wife, Ann Quayle Cannon, were converted to the gospel. George wrote in a letter to his sister:</p>
<p><i>I was sincerely desirous to lead a new life . . . ; and though slow of belief at first, and not seeing the necessity of baptism, yet God in His infinite mercy opened my eyes.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>With the covenant of baptism and the promise of more covenants came the desire to join the Saints in America at all costs. Ann tucked a little money away each month so the family would have the funds necessary for the voyage.</p>
<p><i>The wish to get to Zion became . . . a consuming desire. . . . She began to count the days that must elapse before the ship’s sailing. She was impressed that if this season . . . should pass and find the family still in England, she would not be alive to urge the journey another year. . . . She had a sure premonition that she should not live to reach the shores of America, and told her husband so.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Ann was expecting their seventh child at the time, and George tried to persuade her to wait.</p>
<p>[But] <i>she refused absolutely—she would rather die in trying to go than live</i> [by] <i>remaining. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Both</i> [George and Ann] <i>prayed . . . that God’s blessing would attend them in doing what they believed to be His will.</i><sup>10</sup></p>
<p>On September 17, 1842, George, Ann, and their six children boarded the ship and set sail for America. George later wrote:</p>
<p><i>We are now launched on the bosom of the mighty deep, and sea-sickness has made the passengers for the most part very ill. My dear Ann is dreadfully affected with this nauseous sickness. . . . Yet I have never heard one complaint from her on her own account.</i>[She] <i>regret</i> [s] <i>. . . not being able to assist me in the care of the children.</i><sup>11</sup></p>
<p>The days and weeks went by, and Ann only worsened. On October 28 she passed away. George wrote, “O God, how mysterious are Thy ways! Teach me resignation to Thy will!”<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Both George and Ann Quayle Cannon understood the promise “The Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm . . . in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.”<sup>13</sup> George and Ann Cannon lived their lives keeping their covenant of baptism and looking to the promise of more covenants while carving out a future for their posterity.</p>
<p>What did they clearly understand about the covenant of baptism? What was it that drove George and Ann to come to America at all costs? They were simply doing what they believed to be the Lord’s will.</p>
<p>Today we are not asked to move to Salt Lake City after our baptism. But we do enter into sacred covenants with God, and we promise to do three things:</p>
<p>• Take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ<br />
• Keep His commandments<br />
• Always remember Him</p>
<p>How can we take upon ourselves the name of Christ today? We do more than represent Him and follow Him: “We . . . see ourselves as His. We . . . put Him [and His work] first in our lives. We [seek] what He wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want.”<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>How can we live that baptismal promise in our daily lives here as students at BYU? It is a process, and oftentimes we wrestle to align our lives with the Father’s will. At times we may even question our judgment. We may rationalize our actions and say, “But others are doing it.” The choices we make follow us into our classrooms, in our conversations, with our callings, and on our dates. The results may alter how we dress, our appearance, what we text, the movies we see, and our very thoughts. When we seek His will, He will magnify our every effort to stay on the path back to Him. We need not ever feel alone. Be patient with yourself as you learn this process.</p>
<p>Our prayers may become different, and we may find ourselves asking, “What would Thou have me do?” and “Help me know what is Thy will.” We find ourselves stepping out of the boat, so to speak, to do His will. We prepare spiritually each day with personal prayers to Him, we read His words in the scriptures, and then we trust that He will guide us. His will then becomes ours.</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar said:</p>
<p><i>You exercised your moral agency to accept the conditions of the baptismal covenant. . . . And as a representative of Jesus Christ, your life is no longer just about what you want but what God wants for you.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Missionaries all over the world literally take upon themselves the name of Christ when they put on that missionary badge. We witnessed prophetic revelation last October 6 when President Thomas S. Monson announced the missionary age changes.<sup>16</sup> The response has been astounding. We are witnessing a modern-day miracle in these latter days.</p>
<p>Many of you have experienced a mission, and you know what it is like. It is not easy. When I served my first mission with my husband, in my first sentence in my first letter home to both our children and my parents, who had also served, I asked, “Why didn’t you tell me a mission was this hard?” When it becomes impossible to carry on, it is that covenant to do the Lord’s will that causes a missionary to find a private place and get on his or her knees. His or her prayer may be “I cannot do this alone. Only with Thee can I continue; only with Thee can I learn another language; and only with Thee can I teach those older, wiser, and more articulate than I.” A mission changes our life for the better because we take upon us His name.</p>
<p><b>When we are baptized we covenant to keep His commandments. </b>This commitment to come into God’s kingdom separates—but, as Elder Robert D. Hales notes, does not isolate<sup>17</sup>—us from the world as we “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”<sup>18</sup> To stand as a witness includes everything we do and say.</p>
<p>In living the baptismal covenant we look for ways to keep the commandments rather than look for ways around them.</p>
<p>While I was visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina, I met Marianela, a frail, beautiful mother with two children, ages nine and twelve. All three had been baptized. Marianela was dealing with severe rheumatoid arthritis. She could only stand or lie down; she could not sit. At home she taught her children with what resources she had. She used both the scriptures and the Relief Society manual. I noticed those two books stacked neatly on her table. She wanted her children to keep the commandments and participate on Sunday and partake of the sacrament, so she accepted the invitation from the bishop’s wife to pick them up weekly. Marianela would ride to church lying down in the backseat of the car. It was her way of practicing obedience and aligning her heart with His. In Primary we sing the words “Keep the commandments! In this there is safety; in this there is peace.”<sup>19</sup> There was peace in Marianela’s home.</p>
<p>I saw another example of keeping the commandments in the Ilagan Stake in the Philippines. Just before a meeting I watched a large truck pull up to the chapel entrance. I could see the arms of the members reaching through the slats on the side of the truck to wave to others in the parking lot. The truck was covered with a canvas top. Out jumped numerous happy Filipinos—the men in their white shirts and ties and the women in their dresses. I learned they had ridden for hours to get there, bouncing on the wooden benches inside the truck. We all hurried into the building and sat down. I thought of their sacrifice to be there—and then the tears streamed down my face as they sang the opening song. With smiles they sang “Because I Have Been Given Much.”<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Part of keeping the commandments is serving the Lord. President Lugo, the president of the Ilagan Stake, is a tiny little man with great faith. He has the image of the Savior in his countenance. I learned that he had been in a serious cycle accident and had been in the hospital. It was nearing the time in their stake for their yearly trip to the temple to do baptisms for the dead. He was devastated at the thought of not going with the youth, but he could not walk.</p>
<p>His wife said, “You cannot go. If you go, the youth would have to carry you, and that would be asking too much.”</p>
<p>President Lugo said, “If they will carry me into the temple, I will walk out.”</p>
<p>And that is exactly what he did. How can we possibly draw limits on our service to the Lord?</p>
<p><b>As we keep our covenant to always remember the Lord, He will help us follow His plan. </b>Let’s be honest: While trying to live our covenants, we sometimes get discouraged. We may see nothing but our imperfections. We may think our mistakes are impossible to repair, and we may think we cannot change. We may feel like we are failing.</p>
<p>As we chisel in the sandstone to create this new self, we sometimes chip off huge chunks of stone. Doing this may appear to disfigure our ultimate goal. Like Nephi, we may say, “O wretched man [or woman] that I am!”<sup>21</sup> We may lose hope, and we may fear that there is no way to repair our mistakes. But the real Artist, Jesus Christ, patiently and lovingly stands by our side and waits for us to ask for His help. He is ready to heal us. Then, like Nephi, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, we may ask:</p>
<p><i>Wilt thou redeem my soul? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Wilt thou encircle me . . . in the robe of thy righteousness! . . . Wilt thou make my path straight before me! . . .</i></p>
<p><i>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever.</i><sup>22</sup></p>
<p>One real blessing is that this Sunday we will again have the opportunity to renew the covenant we made at baptism as we partake of the sacrament with the glorious promise that we may always have His Spirit to be with us.</p>
<p>No wonder that when Romans 6 refers to baptism the scripture reads, “Walk in newness of life.”<sup>23</sup> That newness of life is the Atonement working within us, and we can experience it weekly. The Artist, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. “He was foreordained to carry out the Atonement—to come to the earth, suffer the penalty for our sins, die on the cross, and be resurrected.”<sup>24</sup> He will not halt the sculpturing process or put down the chisel until we are perfect and living in His presence. The Atonement is the supreme expression of the Savior’s love for the Father and for us.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>The sculptor Michelangelo, “when asked how he had produced the magnificent statue of an angel, . . . is reported to have simply replied, ‘I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.’”<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>And so it is with the mutual efforts of a loving Savior and a covenant-keeping disciple on the path. The angel is within each one of us. Let us live the covenant we have made at baptism and seek to do His will. We will watch the plan He has masterfully created for each one of us take shape. Regardless of its form, we will stand in awe as the angel emerges, and we will give credit to our Savior Jesus Christ, for He is the perfect Artist.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am honored and humbled to be here to share these few moments with you. I am honored because it has been my privilege to be a faculty member at this very special place for 41 years. I am humbled because I feel that during those years I have been associated with some of the finest young people in the world. I hope that you can hear and feel my heart when I say that I genuinely care about your well-being and have earnestly asked for the Lord’s blessing to be with us this morning. I pray that we might communicate by and feel the affirmation of the Spirit of the Lord as we visit about some important teachings of the Book of Mormon and how they have personal application in our lives today. There is much that I would like to say, so I would ask for your very best efforts as we visit together.
During my years on the faculty I have had the privilege of serving in ecclesiastical positions on this campus for approximately 15 years. Those experiences have had a profound impact on me as I have become more aware of the challenges faced by many of the students at BYU. It is has been my experience that the majority of these challenges fall into at least three different areas.
The first of these has to do with our relationships. By this I mean our sense of connectedness with deity, with spouses, with friends, and with roommates. For some, being at a large university can be a very lonely experience.
The second area of challenge, I believe, is one of maintaining balance. How do we meet all of the demands that are placed upon us by school, family, church, and work? I have said on other occasions that the good news is that you will eventually graduate, but the bad news is that the challenge of maintaining appropriate balance will continue and perhaps intensify as you move into your careers and family life.
The third area of concern for most students is that this is the time in your life when you will be making the most important decisions of your entire life—decisions concerning marriage, careers, family, and where you live. These decisions are stress producing and require divine guidance.
I wish we had time to visit about each of these areas in depth. My overarching theme this morning though is that answers and direction to each of these general dilemmas can be found in sacred places and in sacred records. This morning I would like to discuss counsel given by Nephi in the Book of Mormon that I believe has application to all three areas of challenge. I will briefly discuss the counsel found in 2 Nephi 31 and 32 and conclude with some specific suggestions based upon the doctrine of Christ that will help us to find increased joy and a sense of spiritual connectedness that will provide direction in meeting the concerns and challenges of our life.
As Nephi was about to pass from this mortal sphere, he concluded his life and his teachings with a few words concerning what he called “the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I wish to speak about a unique and inspiring chapter in Church history. It took place in recent years among the beautiful people of Africa. Too often we have misconceptions about Africa and its people. Africa is referred to as the Dark Continent, and the media usually portrays Africans as primitive, starving, or at war with each other. One African official observed that the darkest thing about Africa is America’s ignorance of it (see James H. Robinson, in African American Quotations, ed. Richard Newman [Phoenix, Arizona: Oryx Press, 1998], p. 18). When I was in Africa several years ago, I was sent the following quote: “In Africa there are tribes that beat the ground with clubs while uttering spine-chilling cries. Anthropologists call this a primitive form of self-expression. In America we do the same thing—but we call it golf!”
There is much we can learn from our African brothers and sisters, who are among the great pioneers in this church. President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “The days of pioneering in the Church are still with us; they did not end with covered wagons and handcarts” (in “Many Are Still Blazing Gospel Trails,” Church News, 24 July 1993, p. 6). Pioneers are those individuals who help establish the Church all over the world.
The pioneers that I will focus on this morning had little help from the Church, because they were not members and the Church knew very little about them. I seek your faith and prayers that we might be edified by their example and by the assurance of God’s love for all of his children.
In 1853, nine years after the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith, missionaries were sent to Africa for the first time, but they only proselyted among the white people of South Africa. It was not until 125 years later, following the revelation on the priesthood in 1978, that the gospel was preached to all people of Africa.
However, 30 years before the revelation, Church leaders became aware of other Africans who were interested in the Church. By the 1950s, many letters were sent to Church headquarters from the West African nations of Nigeria and Ghana requesting literature and membership in the Church. The letters were written by devout Christians who had gained a testimony from the Book of Mormon or other Church literature.
What began as a comparative trickle of requests in the early 1950s became a flood by the 1960s. More letters requesting literature were received from Nigeria and Ghana than from all the rest of the world combined (from Edwin Q. Cannon, Jr., interview with Gordon Irving, 10 January 1980, Salt Lake City, Church Historical Department). The Church responded by sending literature, but the demand for Church literature was so great that some Africans even established LDS bookstores. However, since there were no priesthood holders to preside and provide priesthood ordinances, those asking for baptism were told, “The time is not yet. Y</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many years ago I went on a mission to New Zealand, and the day I arrived I had the opportunity of meeting President Matthew Cowley for the first time. He was to be my mission president. During the next two years we became close friends, and during the latter part of my mission I had the honor of living in the mission home with the Cowleys and traveling with President Cowley throughout New Zealand.
He was an excellent teacher and a most interesting person. Some years later, while he was a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, I had the opportunity of bringing him here to BYU on two or three occasions when he was the speaker at devotionals. Everyone loved to hear him and his stories. Even though he has been gone for over thirty-four years, there are people in many parts of the Church still interested in the faith-promoting stories he used to tell. As I have prepared to come here today, I have been reminded over and over of the inspirational talks he gave to the students who were here. Those students might have been your parents—and for some, even your grandparents.
Over and above everything else, President Cowley tried to keep simple the things he taught. In fact, he said many times that he was unable to speak very often of things beyond the first principles of the gospel. I remember well that he spoke about prayer, faith, and repentance. For several years he had a talk ready on baptism, but he was never able to get that far along and give it. He had some ideas on baptism that he wanted to give in general conference, but life ran out before he gave his special talk on baptism. He lived simply. He really didn’t concern himself with his own personal needs. He only wanted to bless people and inspire them to live the gospel in a simple way.
Because of his great faith, many wonderful things continued to happen after our missions were over. We found ourselves blessing people all over who called for him. I was a very young bishop in those days who had a rather difficult time earning a living because President Cowley would insist I leave work and go with him. After we would bless people, he would fast and pray for them and return again and again to those who needed him. We saw great miracles happen in those days. My testimony to you students is that miracles do happen! They are happening on the earth today, and they will continue to happen, particularly to those who believe and have great faith. Miracles occur frequently in the lives of humble, fine Saints who have the faith to make them possible. My feeling about miracles is that the greatest of all miracles is the one that happens in the life of a person who really learns how to pray, who exercises faith to repent, and who lives the gospel in a simple and obedient way.
President Matthew Cowley said many times, “The gospel of Jesus Christ is simply beautiful and beautifully simple.” He spent his whole life trying to explain that there isn’t anything very co</span>
