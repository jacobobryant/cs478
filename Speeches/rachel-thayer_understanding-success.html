  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="President Samuelson, members of the board of trustees, administrators, faculty, guests, and especially graduates, we’ve made it! We’re graduating from Brigham Young University, and today we are here to celebrate our success.

In fact, one of the most important lessons I’ve learned in my time at BYU is to view success differently. I’ve learned that life demands high effort from everyone all the time but does so in two general forms, either of which can result in success.

The first form I’m going to call “climbing.” This describes times in life in which one must devote high effort to developing talents, maximizing opportunities, and realizing potential. Climbing is characterized by persistence and self-motivation and generally results in achievements that our society applauds and actively tracks—résumé items, of which receiving a college education is but one example. Most often when we imagine a “successful” person, we think of someone who has climbed.

I have come to better understand another form of success. Where &lt;i&gt;success&lt;/i&gt; means the favorable ending of a situation requiring effort, I contest that in many cases ­enduring or merely surviving is succeeding. With permission, I want to share the story of one of my good friends. For some time now I have watched this friend struggle with major organ failure. Every semester she registers for classes, becomes severely ill, and is forced to withdraw. She has waited and waited on a transplant list. This year she received a transplant and returned ready to dive into classes at last. Then complications arose, and she learned of a mistake in how the new organ was attached. Now she is waiting on the transplant list again.

My friend is not here graduating with us today. After four years of college, her résumé is not much more bulked and polished than when we arrived, so it may seem that success is postponed for her. I have more than once heard her say disappointedly how very long it will take her to graduate. Yet the way she continues to face it all with dignity is, for now, a favorable ending, making my friend one of the first people I and others who know her would consider successful.

On a separate occasion I was asked to judge scholarship applications for at-risk students graduating from alternative high schools. I was devastated to find that every applicant had more than one looming challenge that I would consider a substantial academic setback: homelessness, teen parenthood, legal trouble, terminally ill parents, learning disabilities, depression, and other serious socioeconomic hurdles. It weighed on me how badly each needed a scholarship—as much for a morale boost and vote of confidence as for financial means. In their essays each conveyed an apologetic tone for how little they had accomplished academically. Though they were remedial students, I felt they underestimated how commendable their efforts were, and I was saddened that their already heavy burdens were exacerbated by a sense of low worth.

I would hardly be saying anything new by asserting that continued effort and overcoming barriers qualifies as success. But actually what I’ve realized is that enduring is harder than climbing—besides being much less commonly rewarded or even acknowledged. So often those enduring the most feel they are accomplishing nothing. Among my own experiences as a student, the most exacting have been those that involve enduring, and were I given the choice, I would always prefer to climb. That is why I am most grateful to be graduating from BYU today.

To our administrators, professors, family members, and other supporters present, I know I speak for the whole class when I say that we are grateful to you for organization, instruction, financial and emotional support, job opportunities, and mentoring. We recognize that we’ve made it here today riding on the contributions of so many others besides ourselves. And of course we are grateful to God. We have all been blessed with a period of climbing with four or more years free enough of trouble to allow us to graduate. We have spent these years preparing to contribute to a society in which one in five children lacks consistent access to food,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; one in twelve has been sexually abused,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and roughly two in three elementary school classes include a student with a parent in prison.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; In so many cases the adults who permit and perpetuate these circumstances are those who made up the similar statistics a generation ago. Against such a sobering background we also realize that where “much is given much is required.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Today as we finalize our commitment to “go forth to serve,” I suggest that to be effective we must develop eyes to see all flavors of human achievement and lend support, approval, and encouragement to the invisible crusades. It will be repeatedly necessary that we wade in to help, unflinchingly and nonjudgmentally. Standing as we do and will along the path to healing in Christ’s Church, it is crucial that association with us be emotionally safe for anyone hurt and discouraged. And when we ourselves become discouraged, we can look to the Savior, who said, “I was an hungred, . . . naked, . . . sick . . . : I was in prison, and ye came unto me.”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

That the world will be a little better for the Class of 2013 is my prayer. Thank you.

			<p>President Samuelson, members of the board of trustees, administrators, faculty, guests, and especially graduates, we’ve made it! We’re graduating from Brigham Young University, and today we are here to celebrate our success.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most important lessons I’ve learned in my time at BYU is to view success differently. I’ve learned that life demands high effort from everyone all the time but does so in two general forms, either of which can result in success.</p>
<p>The first form I’m going to call “climbing.” This describes times in life in which one must devote high effort to developing talents, maximizing opportunities, and realizing potential. Climbing is characterized by persistence and self-motivation and generally results in achievements that our society applauds and actively tracks—résumé items, of which receiving a college education is but one example. Most often when we imagine a “successful” person, we think of someone who has climbed.</p>
<p>I have come to better understand another form of success. Where <i>success</i> means the favorable ending of a situation requiring effort, I contest that in many cases ­enduring or merely surviving is succeeding. With permission, I want to share the story of one of my good friends. For some time now I have watched this friend struggle with major organ failure. Every semester she registers for classes, becomes severely ill, and is forced to withdraw. She has waited and waited on a transplant list. This year she received a transplant and returned ready to dive into classes at last. Then complications arose, and she learned of a mistake in how the new organ was attached. Now she is waiting on the transplant list again.</p>
<p>My friend is not here graduating with us today. After four years of college, her résumé is not much more bulked and polished than when we arrived, so it may seem that success is postponed for her. I have more than once heard her say disappointedly how very long it will take her to graduate. Yet the way she continues to face it all with dignity is, for now, a favorable ending, making my friend one of the first people I and others who know her would consider successful.</p>
<p>On a separate occasion I was asked to judge scholarship applications for at-risk students graduating from alternative high schools. I was devastated to find that every applicant had more than one looming challenge that I would consider a substantial academic setback: homelessness, teen parenthood, legal trouble, terminally ill parents, learning disabilities, depression, and other serious socioeconomic hurdles. It weighed on me how badly each needed a scholarship—as much for a morale boost and vote of confidence as for financial means. In their essays each conveyed an apologetic tone for how little they had accomplished academically. Though they were remedial students, I felt they underestimated how commendable their efforts were, and I was saddened that their already heavy burdens were exacerbated by a sense of low worth.</p>
<p>I would hardly be saying anything new by asserting that continued effort and overcoming barriers qualifies as success. But actually what I’ve realized is that enduring is harder than climbing—besides being much less commonly rewarded or even acknowledged. So often those enduring the most feel they are accomplishing nothing. Among my own experiences as a student, the most exacting have been those that involve enduring, and were I given the choice, I would always prefer to climb. That is why I am most grateful to be graduating from BYU today.</p>
<p>To our administrators, professors, family members, and other supporters present, I know I speak for the whole class when I say that we are grateful to you for organization, instruction, financial and emotional support, job opportunities, and mentoring. We recognize that we’ve made it here today riding on the contributions of so many others besides ourselves. And of course we are grateful to God. We have all been blessed with a period of climbing with four or more years free enough of trouble to allow us to graduate. We have spent these years preparing to contribute to a society in which one in five children lacks consistent access to food,<sup>1</sup> one in twelve has been sexually abused,<sup>2</sup> and roughly two in three elementary school classes include a student with a parent in prison.<sup>3</sup> In so many cases the adults who permit and perpetuate these circumstances are those who made up the similar statistics a generation ago. Against such a sobering background we also realize that where “much is given much is required.”<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Today as we finalize our commitment to “go forth to serve,” I suggest that to be effective we must develop eyes to see all flavors of human achievement and lend support, approval, and encouragement to the invisible crusades. It will be repeatedly necessary that we wade in to help, unflinchingly and nonjudgmentally. Standing as we do and will along the path to healing in Christ’s Church, it is crucial that association with us be emotionally safe for anyone hurt and discouraged. And when we ourselves become discouraged, we can look to the Savior, who said, “I was an hungred, . . . naked, . . . sick . . . : I was in prison, and ye came unto me.”<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>That the world will be a little better for the Class of 2013 is my prayer. Thank you.</p>

Music has always been a very important part of my life. Nearly every major memory of my childhood involves music of some kind: singing with my family on road trips to pass the time; learning barbershop music with my mom and sisters; listening to the Tijuana Brass band on the record player while decorating our Christmas tree; singing my father’s favorite song, “Love at Home” (see Hymns, 2002, no. 294), for family home evening; and admiring my mother as she played the organ in our sacrament meeting every week—something she still does at the young age of eighty. Given that music played such a prominent role in my youth, it will not surprise you to know that I took piano lessons for ten years, from the age of eight to seventeen.
My first piano teacher—we will call her Mrs. Smith—was very strict and had high expectations for mastery. During my lesson she would often follow the music with a pencil as I played. Sometimes, after I hit a sour note or used the wrong fingering, Mrs. Smith would flick my fingers with that pencil. She intended to help me recognize the mistake so that I could correct it. Unfortunately, after several experiences with the dreaded pencil, I learned that the least painful way to handle my musical mistakes was to remove my hands from the keys as quickly as possible.
This habit of abruptly stopping after a mistake was also unintentionally reinforced when I would practice at home. Our piano was positioned on a wall that was opposite our kitchen; in fact, it was back-to-back with our stove. I would often practice while my mother was making dinner on the other side of the wall. When I would make a mistake, she would make a staccato “ah” sound. Startled, my hands would fly from the keys.
I know this was not the intended outcome because I heard her do the same thing when she made her own mistakes at the organ or piano. She still does this today, but only in practice. When she is at the organ or piano for performance, there are few errors, but when they occur, they are hardly noticeable. She can play right on through a mistake like nothing happened. I, on the other hand, cannot.
Most of my piano recitals with Mrs. Smith took place in the chapel of my home ward building. These were reverent occasions—no clapping after the end of each performance, just polite smiles from the audience as we each took our turn at the grand piano. We were not allowed to use our music, so for me, the walk up those three velvety red steps to the piano felt like walking into a battle unarmed. I was terrified that I would make a mistake, take my hands from the keys, and be unable to find the right placement again.
This terror of performing would follow me into adulthood. When I was still in the early years of my public accounting career and had two small children at home, I was called as the Relief Society pianist.
The first week was a disaster. I lur</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. It is an honor to stand before you this day, and it is an honor to teach at this great university. I have long pondered the message I would share today, and I have looked forward to this day with apprehension—praying that I will say those things that will be of most benefit to you. This opportunity to speak to you has been overwhelming and humbling, to say the least, and I have taken courage from the words of King David to his son Solomon in 1 Chronicles 28:20:
Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.
Knowledge and Intelligence
I love coming to campus each fall. I can feel of your knowledge and intelligence—I find it invigorating. In Doctrine and Covenants 93:30 we read, “All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.” In Doctrine and Covenants 93:36 the Lord clarifies the meaning of intelligence: “The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.” We have been instructed in Doctrine and Covenants 88:118, “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” What does this mean for you and me? In my mind this translates to my being diligent in pursuing knowledge and being obedient in applying my learning to righteous purposes as I exercise faith.
President Brigham Young taught:
We . . . keep learning, and we do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information. That may appear a strange idea to some; but it is for the plain and simple reason that we are not capacitated to receive all knowledge at once. We must therefore receive a little here and a little there.1
In other words, the work of knowledge and, subsequently, intelligence is developmental and ongoing throughout our lives. We begin our learning as an infant, and personal development is ongoing.
One of my favorite growth and development theories comes from a well-known psychologist, Erik Erikson. Dr. Erikson maintains that an individual’s development occurs throughout the span of life. He outlined a theory known as the eight stages of psychosocial development. This is a theory that I have found enlightening, especially considering our understanding that Heavenly Father’s plan for us is developmental. I have implemented aspects of this theory into my daily interactions, not only as a professional but also as a wife, mother, friend, daughter, and neighbor.
According to Erikson, during the course of our lifetime, each one of us mov</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is always an exciting and satisfying opportunity to greet you at the beginning of a new semester. In my long experience of school beginnings, I have concluded that while all are positive in the sense that there has been yet little time for anything serious to go wrong, each new term is different in some ways from any other. This fall at BYU, for example, we have fewer first-year young men and fewer second-year young women as a result of the change in missionary ages announced by President Thomas S. Monson last October. I don’t know what next year will bring, but in two years we will have more returned missionaries than ever before just starting their BYU careers.
To all of you I add my welcome and express my appreciation that you are here, whether for the first time or continuing your educational quests. And for those of you back from missionary or military service, a special greeting is in order. Likewise, we appreciate our nontraditional and bachelor of general studies students being with us.
This past July, on the way to a family excursion with my siblings and their spouses, Sharon and I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London, England, the morning after Andy Murray, a native Scotsman and British hero, won the Wimbledon tennis tournament. This major event in international professional tennis had not been won by a Brit in seventy-seven years before Murray’s exciting victory. The UK media were filled with accounts of his dramatic win, and there seemed to be a national celebration over the outcome of this tennis match. Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought Andy should be knighted, although Murray himself reported he didn’t think that was necessarily merited. His picture was on the front page of every newspaper, and, I am told, his success was the lead story on television for a few days.
This national pride is perhaps understandable and maybe even laudatory. What I found interesting was that there was little, if any, mention made of his serving faults, unforced errors, or games lost or any of the particularly excellent points scored by his opponent. The entire story would seem, if you didn’t look at the match statistics closely, like a perfectly executed victory that was never in doubt.
The thought occurred to me that perhaps winning Wimbledon or another sporting contest is more like successfully completing the game of life or our BYU education than any of us might really expect. What I mean by this is that I believe the plan of salvation makes it possible for all of us—when we have tried to live our lives the best we can and have worked to overcome our mistakes and repent of our sins—to come to the Final Judgment or graduation and have the wonderful pronouncement made to us of “well done, thou good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:21).
You might be thinking, “What has this to do with my work and study here at BYU?” That is a very good question. Because of my own experience and als</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, beloved students, faculty, friends, family, and my esteemed brother in the gospel for over 35 years, President Cecil O. Samuelson. I have always treasured our close and respectful relationship, and I say to you, President Samuelson, that Brigham Young could not have selected a better leader than you, who has reached great heights in medicine, in life, and, above all, in integrity. Thank you for such a generous introduction, and thank you to the beautiful choir from whom we have just heard. I am so privileged to be invited to this world-class university. My wife, Karen, and I thank you.
I am truly honored to be here today. May I begin with this simple sentence: God did not put us here to fail. I would say to you, have faith in yourself—believe in what you are doing, and, most important, be a person of integrity. It is totally up to you, and no one else, how your life evolves. Many would like to think that our parents, our professors, or even our bishops are responsible for our future. What we become, who we are, and the footprint we will leave in life is based entirely on our own determination, hard work, education, and sacrifice. Our Heavenly Father expects the best from each of us. We must believe in ourselves. Don’t give in when the going gets rough. You are laying the foundation of a great work, and that great work is your life. Never cut corners, demean other people, or waste time “hanging out.” Decide who you are and what your goals entail—then go for the roses. Life has little regard for those who waste time.
My father and grandfather were rural schoolteachers in southern Idaho and Utah, and it was my hope to someday follow their example. But I refused to forsake my dreams, and each day my mind was filled with new ideas and hopes and aspirations. I would never listen to anyone who spoke negatively nor acknowledge that there were shortcomings that could not be overcome. I always thought that the key to life is finding happiness in any given place or time while remembering the great scriptural axiom “Men are, that they might have joy” (2 Nephi 2:25).
People around us cheer when we are happy and positive. Self-pity is the most negative quality of the human spirit. Thus when one is happy and positive and truly believes in himself or herself, great achievements lie ahead.
Throughout my life, in my heart and soul, I wanted to explore the world—to reach into the unknown—to travel beyond my childhood boundaries. It is so important that we each live our own dream—not someone else’s dream. If what you are doing in your life is not your own dream, then whose is it?
Perhaps I can best explain this through a personal experience.
When I was the age of many of you and was attending college at the very challenging Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, things weren’t going great, at least not academically. It was a struggle for me simply because I didn’t apply m</span>
