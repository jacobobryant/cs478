  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="When we moved to Provo thirty years ago, I was in my twenties. Our oldest son was two, and our youngest son was just a few weeks old. I had been a member of the Church for less than ten years.

Shortly after arriving in Provo, I met Bertha. Bertha was in her sixties. I knew a little bit about Bertha. I knew she lived in our stake. I knew she was respected by those who knew her. I also knew that she was a leader and a woman of service. People sought her advice.

I remember attending a stake Relief Society function at which Bertha was one of the women on a panel that was answering questions and giving advice to those in attendance on a variety of topics. I noticed that Bertha was being asked for a lot of advice about raising children. I soon discovered why. She was the mother of thirteen children. I appreciated her responses to the questions. She seemed to have all the wisdom and experience that I lacked.

Another thing I knew about Bertha was that she seemed to like walking. Sometimes I would see her walking in the neighborhood. One morning while I was walking with my friend, she asked me if it would be okay if Bertha joined us occasionally on our walks. I told her that was fine. But privately, the thought of walking with Bertha intimidated me somewhat, mainly because I held her in such high esteem.

A few days later my friend invited Bertha to walk with us. Before Bertha met us for our walk that morning, my friend told me a couple of things about Bertha that she thought would be helpful to me. She told me that Bertha sometimes had a little difficulty hearing and that her shins sometimes bothered her - especially when walking uphill. I thought these things were good to know.

Our walking route that day began in the Tree Streets south of the Provo Temple. We headed toward the temple, which is a steady uphill walk. I dont remember much of our conversation that day. I remember only the question I asked Bertha once we reached the top of the road by the temple and began our steady descent toward home.

Remembering that Berthas shins sometimes bothered her, I asked, "Bertha, how are your shins?"

There was a bit of an awkward pause, and then, with much earnestness, Bertha replied, "Im working on them, and hopefully they are improving every day."

I responded, "Oh, thats good. Thankfully its all downhill from here."

I was feeling pretty magnanimous about my expressed concern for Bertha. For a couple of minutes we walked along in a somewhat awkward silence.

Then my friend suddenly got a relieved look on her face and, turning to me, exclaimed, "You said &lt;i&gt;shins,&lt;/i&gt; didnt you?"

My first thought was, "Yes, of course I said &lt;i&gt;shins."&lt;/i&gt; Then it occurred to me that they had both thought I had asked Bertha how her &lt;i&gt;sins&lt;/i&gt; were doing!

I was mortified! There I was, this inexperienced young mother, asking Bertha, this accomplished and wise woman, how her sins were doing! How impertinent I must have seemed, especially to have commented that its all downhill from here - as if implying that once you hit a certain age, it can only be downhill.

I really dont know what Bertha thought of me. I do know that I was grateful that my friend clarified the misunderstanding that I had unintentionally caused.

That experience and many others like it have taught me the critical importance of effective communication. Our ability to communicate with one another is one of the most important aspects of our lives.

In Ether 1:3337 we see that the importance of communication was understood by the brother of Jared. "At the time [when] the Lord confounded the language of the people" (verse 33), the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord so that He would not confound the language of his family and friends. The brother of Jared realized that effective communication was vital to the on-going well-being of his people.

The BYU mission statement emphasizes the importance of clear communication. It states that a BYU education should "help students . . . communicate effectively."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; My New Years plea for you is that you emphasize this part of your education this year.

Effective communication is essential to many aspects of your university life. This past semester I attended one of the Eternal Family religion courses. One of the class sections was on dating. One day the professor conducted a live, in-class survey. The questions focused on what the students would like to change about their dating experiences and what they appreciated about those experiences. The majority of the responses related to communication.

Here are some of the things the students, both men and women, wanted to change:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;They wanted their dates to be better at communicating.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;They wanted their dates to sincerely listen and show that they were interested in them.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;They wanted their dates to put away their cell phones.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;They wanted their dates to express their feelings better.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;They wanted their dates to be patient with them when they were having difficulty expressing their own feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Here are some of the things the students appreciated about their dating experiences:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;When their dates would communicate clearly with them.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;When their dates would listen sincerely to them.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;When their dates would show that they were interested in them.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;When their dates would put away their cell phones.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;When their dates would show patience with them when they were having difficulty expressing themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In sum, what the students wished they could change and what they appreciated were mirror images of each other. They wished their dates communicated better, and they appreciated the times when they communicated well.

Of course there were comments that related to things other than communication. For example, one man commented that he liked it when his dates didnt "check out" his roommates. Another said that he liked it when his dates complimented his muscles. But by far the most commented upon topic - for good or ill - was communication.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Communication is the key to all successful relationships, including in dating and marriage.

Let me provide three simple suggestions to help us increase our ability to communicate effectively:

&lt;b&gt;First&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; we should learn how to listen more closely and pay more attention to what is being said, even if that means putting away our cell phones. Listening is a skill that is not easily developed, and being in a university setting sometimes makes it more difficult.

S. I. Hayakawa, the former president of San Francisco State College and a former United States senator, made this astute observation:

&lt;i&gt;Few people . . . have had much training in listening. The training of most oververbalized professional intellectuals is in the opposite direction. Living in a competitive culture, most of us are most of the time chiefly concerned with getting our own views across, and we tend to find other peoples speeches a tedious interruption of the flow of our own ideas. Hence, it is necessary to emphasize that listening does not mean simply maintaining a polite silence while you are rehearsing in your mind the speech you are going to make the next time you can grab a conversational opening. Nor does listening mean waiting alertly for the flaws in the other&lt;/i&gt; [persons] &lt;i&gt;arguments so that later you can mow&lt;/i&gt; [the speaker] &lt;i&gt;down. Listening means trying to see the problem the way the speaker sees it - which means not sympathy, which is &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;feeling for&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [the speaker], &lt;i&gt;but empathy, which is &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;experiencing with&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [the speaker]. &lt;i&gt;Listening requires entering actively and imaginatively into the other&lt;/i&gt; [persons] &lt;i&gt;situation and trying to understand a frame of reference different from your own. This is not always an easy task.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But a good listener does not merely remain silent.&lt;/i&gt; [A good listener] &lt;i&gt;asks questions. However, these questions must avoid all implications . . . of skepticism or challenge or hostility. They must clearly be motivated by curiosity about the speakers views.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

We will all communicate more effectively if we concentrate more on what &lt;i&gt;others&lt;/i&gt; are saying and less on what &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; plan to say.

&lt;b&gt;Second&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; we should make sure that we are considerate of those who are communicating with us and of the impact our words and expressions have on them. A friend shared an experience she had with one of her former mission companions. Since their mission they had seen each other occasionally. On one of these occasions, the mission companion confided in my friend about the difficulties she was facing with one of her children and the trial and heartache this experience created.

In the course of the conversation, the mission companion asked my friend what her greatest heartache was. My friend, feeling that she could safely share her thoughts and feelings about her greatest heartache, proceeded to tell her mission companion about the heartache she was currently facing with one of her own children. Instead of responding with the expected empathy and understanding, the mission companion immediately was critical of my friend, judging her and her situation with harshness.

My friend was surprised and shocked, to say the least, at her companions response - especially since it was the mission companion who had asked the question in the first place. My friend thought that she was in "a safe place" while relating her experience to her former mission companion, but instead she found herself exposed to criticism and harsh judgment with no empathy or understanding.

While there is some disagreement about the role of safe places for public discourse on college campuses, personal communication is best accomplished in an environment in which both participants feel they are in a private, safe place - one in which thoughts and opinions can be expressed without hostile responses.

&lt;b&gt;Third&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; we need to remember that our most important communication is with our Heavenly Father. Not only will He listen to our prayers and answer them when we ask for His help, but He will teach us through His example how to become better listeners and communicators. He is a careful and empathetic listener. Our communications with Him are safe. And He can help us develop the skills we need to communicate effectively.

That we may follow His example in this and all aspects is my hope, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>When we moved to Provo thirty years ago, I was in my twenties. Our oldest son was two, and our youngest son was just a few weeks old. I had been a member of the Church for less than ten years.</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving in Provo, I met Bertha. Bertha was in her sixties. I knew a little bit about Bertha. I knew she lived in our stake. I knew she was respected by those who knew her. I also knew that she was a leader and a woman of service. People sought her advice.</p>
<p>I remember attending a stake Relief Society function at which Bertha was one of the women on a panel that was answering questions and giving advice to those in attendance on a variety of topics. I noticed that Bertha was being asked for a lot of advice about raising children. I soon discovered why. She was the mother of thirteen children. I appreciated her responses to the questions. She seemed to have all the wisdom and experience that I lacked.</p>
<p>Another thing I knew about Bertha was that she seemed to like walking. Sometimes I would see her walking in the neighborhood. One morning while I was walking with my friend, she asked me if it would be okay if Bertha joined us occasionally on our walks. I told her that was fine. But privately, the thought of walking with Bertha intimidated me somewhat, mainly because I held her in such high esteem.</p>
<p>A few days later my friend invited Bertha to walk with us. Before Bertha met us for our walk that morning, my friend told me a couple of things about Bertha that she thought would be helpful to me. She told me that Bertha sometimes had a little difficulty hearing and that her shins sometimes bothered her - especially when walking uphill. I thought these things were good to know.</p>
<p>Our walking route that day began in the Tree Streets south of the Provo Temple. We headed toward the temple, which is a steady uphill walk. I dont remember much of our conversation that day. I remember only the question I asked Bertha once we reached the top of the road by the temple and began our steady descent toward home.</p>
<p>Remembering that Berthas shins sometimes bothered her, I asked, "Bertha, how are your shins?"</p>
<p>There was a bit of an awkward pause, and then, with much earnestness, Bertha replied, "Im working on them, and hopefully they are improving every day."</p>
<p>I responded, "Oh, thats good. Thankfully its all downhill from here."</p>
<p>I was feeling pretty magnanimous about my expressed concern for Bertha. For a couple of minutes we walked along in a somewhat awkward silence.</p>
<p>Then my friend suddenly got a relieved look on her face and, turning to me, exclaimed, "You said <i>shins,</i> didnt you?"</p>
<p>My first thought was, "Yes, of course I said <i>shins."</i> Then it occurred to me that they had both thought I had asked Bertha how her <i>sins</i> were doing!</p>
<p>I was mortified! There I was, this inexperienced young mother, asking Bertha, this accomplished and wise woman, how her sins were doing! How impertinent I must have seemed, especially to have commented that its all downhill from here - as if implying that once you hit a certain age, it can only be downhill.</p>
<p>I really dont know what Bertha thought of me. I do know that I was grateful that my friend clarified the misunderstanding that I had unintentionally caused.</p>
<p>That experience and many others like it have taught me the critical importance of effective communication. Our ability to communicate with one another is one of the most important aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>In Ether 1:3337 we see that the importance of communication was understood by the brother of Jared. "At the time [when] the Lord confounded the language of the people" (verse 33), the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord so that He would not confound the language of his family and friends. The brother of Jared realized that effective communication was vital to the on-going well-being of his people.</p>
<p>The BYU mission statement emphasizes the importance of clear communication. It states that a BYU education should "help students . . . communicate effectively."<sup>1</sup> My New Years plea for you is that you emphasize this part of your education this year.</p>
<p>Effective communication is essential to many aspects of your university life. This past semester I attended one of the Eternal Family religion courses. One of the class sections was on dating. One day the professor conducted a live, in-class survey. The questions focused on what the students would like to change about their dating experiences and what they appreciated about those experiences. The majority of the responses related to communication.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things the students, both men and women, wanted to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>They wanted their dates to be better at communicating.</li>
<li>They wanted their dates to sincerely listen and show that they were interested in them.</li>
<li>They wanted their dates to put away their cell phones.</li>
<li>They wanted their dates to express their feelings better.</li>
<li>They wanted their dates to be patient with them when they were having difficulty expressing their own feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the things the students appreciated about their dating experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>When their dates would communicate clearly with them.</li>
<li>When their dates would listen sincerely to them.</li>
<li>When their dates would show that they were interested in them.</li>
<li>When their dates would put away their cell phones.</li>
<li>When their dates would show patience with them when they were having difficulty expressing themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, what the students wished they could change and what they appreciated were mirror images of each other. They wished their dates communicated better, and they appreciated the times when they communicated well.</p>
<p>Of course there were comments that related to things other than communication. For example, one man commented that he liked it when his dates didnt "check out" his roommates. Another said that he liked it when his dates complimented his muscles. But by far the most commented upon topic - for good or ill - was communication.<sup>2</sup> Communication is the key to all successful relationships, including in dating and marriage.</p>
<p>Let me provide three simple suggestions to help us increase our ability to communicate effectively:</p>
<p><b>First</b><b>,</b> we should learn how to listen more closely and pay more attention to what is being said, even if that means putting away our cell phones. Listening is a skill that is not easily developed, and being in a university setting sometimes makes it more difficult.</p>
<p>S. I. Hayakawa, the former president of San Francisco State College and a former United States senator, made this astute observation:</p>
<p><i>Few people . . . have had much training in listening. The training of most oververbalized professional intellectuals is in the opposite direction. Living in a competitive culture, most of us are most of the time chiefly concerned with getting our own views across, and we tend to find other peoples speeches a tedious interruption of the flow of our own ideas. Hence, it is necessary to emphasize that listening does not mean simply maintaining a polite silence while you are rehearsing in your mind the speech you are going to make the next time you can grab a conversational opening. Nor does listening mean waiting alertly for the flaws in the other</i> [persons] <i>arguments so that later you can mow</i> [the speaker] <i>down. Listening means trying to see the problem the way the speaker sees it - which means not sympathy, which is </i><b><i>feeling for</i></b> [the speaker], <i>but empathy, which is </i><b><i>experiencing with</i></b> [the speaker]. <i>Listening requires entering actively and imaginatively into the other</i> [persons] <i>situation and trying to understand a frame of reference different from your own. This is not always an easy task.</i></p>
<p><i>But a good listener does not merely remain silent.</i> [A good listener] <i>asks questions. However, these questions must avoid all implications . . . of skepticism or challenge or hostility. They must clearly be motivated by curiosity about the speakers views.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>We will all communicate more effectively if we concentrate more on what <i>others</i> are saying and less on what <i>we</i> plan to say.</p>
<p><b>Second</b><b>,</b> we should make sure that we are considerate of those who are communicating with us and of the impact our words and expressions have on them. A friend shared an experience she had with one of her former mission companions. Since their mission they had seen each other occasionally. On one of these occasions, the mission companion confided in my friend about the difficulties she was facing with one of her children and the trial and heartache this experience created.</p>
<p>In the course of the conversation, the mission companion asked my friend what her greatest heartache was. My friend, feeling that she could safely share her thoughts and feelings about her greatest heartache, proceeded to tell her mission companion about the heartache she was currently facing with one of her own children. Instead of responding with the expected empathy and understanding, the mission companion immediately was critical of my friend, judging her and her situation with harshness.</p>
<p>My friend was surprised and shocked, to say the least, at her companions response - especially since it was the mission companion who had asked the question in the first place. My friend thought that she was in "a safe place" while relating her experience to her former mission companion, but instead she found herself exposed to criticism and harsh judgment with no empathy or understanding.</p>
<p>While there is some disagreement about the role of safe places for public discourse on college campuses, personal communication is best accomplished in an environment in which both participants feel they are in a private, safe place - one in which thoughts and opinions can be expressed without hostile responses.</p>
<p><b>Third</b><b>,</b> we need to remember that our most important communication is with our Heavenly Father. Not only will He listen to our prayers and answer them when we ask for His help, but He will teach us through His example how to become better listeners and communicators. He is a careful and empathetic listener. Our communications with Him are safe. And He can help us develop the skills we need to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>That we may follow His example in this and all aspects is my hope, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My father was a builder of big buildings, some well known. So when I returned from my two-year mission to Japan and wanted summer work, I ended up forty feet down at the bottom of an air conditioning shaft, stripping forms from freshly poured concrete. My captive coworker, Chuck, made the mistake of asking why I would "waste two valuable years like that." I am sure he had no idea what he was in for, and I unleashed my abundance of missionary zeal.
At some point in our discussion I heard a noise overhead and saw the familiar silhouette of my father leaning over the shaft. What he said was a surprise: "Chuck, I dont know what hes saying down there, but I believe it is true. Now get back to work."
This is for me the most treasured testimony my father bore, but I hope we can surpass that level of communication today. I dont want you to go back to class thinking, "I dont know what he was saying down there, but I believe it is true." Instead I want to persuade you to rethink the way you communicate to others your feelings about your connections to heaven and the amazing blessings of what you know and what you feel.
Why persuade? Because "no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood" - and I hold no position that grants me that kind of dominion over you anyway - "only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;C 121:41). I want to persuade you to consider another perspective that will help you follow the counsel of an apostle.
Elder David A. Bednar stood here in August and asked us "to sweep the earth as with a flood of truth and righteousness" in our online efforts ("To Sweep the Earth as with a Flood," BYU Education Week devotional address, 19 August 2014, lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/to-sweep-the-earth-as-with-a-flood). His devotional was historic in many ways. I was so delighted.
Elder Bednars first qualification for this effort was simple:
We are disciples, and our messages should be authentic. A person or product that is not authentic is false, fake, and fraudulent. Our messages should be truthful, honest, and accurate. We should not exaggerate, embellish, or pretend to be someone or something we are not. ["To Sweep the Earth"]
Following his counsel to be authentic will be more difficult for us, as central-culture Mormons, because for decades we have desired to honor the Lord by always putting our best foot forward. Look down at your feet, if you will. The problem is that nearly every mortal has two feet, and most require both of those feet to stand properly.
Over the past ten years I have regularly had the punishment and privilege of watching through a one-way mirror as focus groups discuss Mormons. The people in these groups were not just any people; they were selected for these sessions because their beliefs and actions demo</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Some months ago, when I was invited to speak today, I asked what I should talk about. After a long pause the voice said, "Well, people usually talk about things theyre good at." So my topic today is conflict.
I used to think other people had conflicts but that I was immune. Then I came upon two incidents in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith that completely changed my understanding of conflicts and forced me to admit I probably have as many as anybody else.
What is a conflict? For our purposes today, a conflict is any situation in which both sides feel the other is in the wrong.
Ill begin with seven propositions about conflicts.
1. It is strange, but unless we had a conflict in the last few hours, most of us dont remember our conflicts. This may be good, because it saves us pain, but it creates a problem. If we dont remember our conflicts, we cant learn anything from them.
2. We probably experience conflicts differently - depending on our personalities, our prior experiences (such as the way conflicts were handled in the home where we grew up), and perhaps other factors such as gender and culture.
3. In Mormon culture most people are conflict avoiders. However, some of us are neutral about conflict, and some of us actually enjoy a good conflict.
4. If we are in relationships with others, there will be conflicts. They may be small or they may be large, but there will surely be conflicts. Can you think of any conflicts in your life right now? Perhaps a few hints will help. If you do think of a conflict or two, I hope you will jot them down.
a. Conflicts with family, such as father, mother, siblings, spouse, children, or in-laws.
b. Conflicts with people you see often who are not family: neighbors, landlords, merchants, even people at church. President Brigham Young summed it up in rhyme:
To live with Saints in Heaven is bliss and glory
To live with Saints on Earth is another story.1
5. It takes two sides to create a conflict. More important, there is almost always fault on both sides. As someone said, "Its a mighty thin pancake that only has one side."
6. During a conflict we are usually blind to our own fault and we blame the other side.
7. A final proposition introduces my theme. When we remember our conflicts and reflect on them, they are like mirrors that can teach us things about ourselves that are otherwise difficult to discover. If we permit them, our conflicts will show us where we are weak, defensive, prideful, or otherwise in need of repair.
First Example
Ill illustrate the value of conflicts with three examples. Two are from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These both involve Oliver Cowdery, who, at the time, was Josephs most trusted associate. These conflicts occurred very close to each other in the summer of 1830, just after the Church w</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, Dr. Broomhead and members of the University Chorale, for that wonderful rendition of "For All the Saints" (Hymns, 1985, no. 82). That song is to be sung majestically, which you certainly did. Your words set the tone for my address today. I would like to look at how we as Saints - "faithful, true, and bold" - might increase our efforts to profess our faith.
On a rather cold, rainy day many years ago, I found myself in a meeting over a difficult issue. Waiting outside this meeting was what appeared to be an army of reporters. To say that I was a bit unnerved by their presence is an understatement. I was new to the office of University Communications, having spent 12 years with BYU Magazine, and was still trying to adjust to the media scrutiny that accompanies a breaking story.
As the meeting concluded, someone asked the question "Who is going to talk to all of those reporters?"
The person in charge responded, "Carri is."
And with that, everyone got up and left.
Do you remember how Moses felt when the Lord asked him to represent the Israelites before Pharaoh? In my own small way, I think I caught a glimpse of it on that rainy day. I too wanted to cry out, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent . . . : but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" (Exodus 4:10).
But, just as the Lord beckoned Moses to "therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth" (Exodus 4:12), I felt the Lords gentle push in response to my hasty prayer. And so I walked out that door confident in the message I needed to deliver, even if I was not confident as the messenger.
I faced the reporters, and all went well until the final question, when they asked if they could interview BYU students about the Honor Code. I knew I could not say no, even though I really wanted to just handpick a few students who I knew would respond in a predictable and positive way.
Instead I responded, "Absolutely. Talk to anyone you like."
That night as I waited for the 10 oclock news to air, my heart was racing. I knew what I had said, but what I didnt know was how the students had responded. I wondered if they would challenge and negate everything I had said.
As I watched the various news reports and those random students - students just like you - talk about their feelings and belief in the Honor Code, my once-racing heart swelled with pride. I realized that while in this instance I had been asked to be the official spokesperson for BYU, the most important spokespeople were you, the students. It was your voices people would remember; it was your voices that turned a rather negative news story into a positive one.
Today I would like to talk about what it means to be a spokesperson - at BYU and in the kingdom of God - a role that each one of us plays. The incident that I described above is not unique; in fact, it happens on an almost daily basis. Perhaps you saw this recent</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am happy to be here today, though I feel like the speaker in church who said she felt inadequate standing before the congregation. One sister said to another, "Isnt she humble?" And the other responded, "Thats no real accomplishment, she has a lot to be humble about."
Some of my students are sitting here thinking, "No joke!"
I do feel overwhelmed at the prospect of attempting to share something new and of value as I stand in the footsteps of the great men and women who have been here before me. I pray I can share some of my life and thoughts in a way that may help some of you have a new and useful perspective about words and their place in a Christ-centered life.
Words are my tools. As a librarian I collect, catalog, and preserve them. As a lawyer, which is my principal profession, I search them out, savoring the power, sound, feel, and nuance of them. As a mother, words are something I teach, and teach with - a method of motivation, reward, and reprimand. As a person of faith, they are second only to spiritual promptings as a form of guidance, comfort, and inspiration.
Lately, however, I have observed a distressing escalation of the use of words to hurt, anger, divide, and make war. Perhaps as a law professor I should approve of the trend. It does, after all, make well-paying work for many of our graduates. However, I have viewed myself as a solver of problems and a peacemaker, not as a warrior. I have not found entertainment in L.A. Law or its more recent progeny. Neither am I comfortable with the wars of words that rage around us.
Today I would like to talk about the power of words. I would like to remind you of some of their magic. There is nothing arcane about words. They are not supernatural. They are like light and gravity - they are central to our existence, and, because they are pervasive, we often fail to see them or recognize their power and worth.
John sets us on the right path:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. [John 1:13]
The Savior is the Word. Let us consider whether our words are worthy of Him.
Words are among the most marvelous gifts we have as human beings. Words are tools used by God to build the necessary framework to lift us from our mortal existence and carry us back to His presence. He uses words for making and keeping binding commitments. The difference between an eternal marriage and a marriage of degrading cohabitation is a few words.
This is made clear in one of the most loved films of the BYU community, past and present:
Buttercup: Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
Westley: What hideous sin have you committed lately?
