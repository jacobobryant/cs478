  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear brothers and sisters, I am happy to be with you today, especially as you are beginning a new summer session of study at Brigham Young University. It is pleasing to me to see so many of my dear friends - President Holland, my family, and my mission family, who have come to lend their love and spiritual strength to me on this occasion.

This is a devotional assembly. It is a moment for each of us to think of heavenly things, of things that will build our spiritual strength and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father. I realize, in part, the responsibility that has been placed upon me. Therefore, I seek for the spirit of the Holy Ghost to be with me. And I pray that you, too, will sense my desire and let your faith and prayers be exercised in my behalf.

The famous Christian reformer, Billy Sunday, is quoted as having said that the secret to his success was that "He started a fire in himself and the people came to watch him burn." I feel that I have come with a fire in my heart, kindled by the love that I have for the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that as the Spirit burns in me, this same Spirit will ignite a fire in you. "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because of One Man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Some time ago, while laboring in the Lords missionary service, a wonderful missionary came to see me. It was near the end of his mission. He was very depressed. Saddened by his own perception of personal success, he had imposed upon himself a standard from which he had fallen far short. As he spoke, he recounted for me the difficult time he had experienced in the MTC. While he was there, his father had died unexpectedly, and for a brief period of time the elder had considered leaving the mission and returning home. But, encouraged by a loving mother and spurred on by an individual commitment, he continued his training and finally found himself in the beautiful country of Bolivia.

I listened to him as he told me of the initial efforts he had made in his mission to work hard, pray often, follow all the rules, and be a model missionary - expecting, of course, to be rewarded with hundreds of baptisms. But, unfortunately, the baptisms had not come. Gradually he began to slacken his pace. He felt that his prayers were not being heard, so why pray? The mission rules seemed somehow to be burdensome. They were restrictive, silly things, written by the mission president only to goad and irritate him and the other missionaries.

In despair, he said, "And now Im nobody! What I do wont make any difference!" Then searchingly, he quickly added, "Will it, President Hammond?"

For an instant the same questions passed through my own mind. "Can he make a difference? Can I? Can anyone? Does it matter what one man does?" Then, in my minds eye I saw a myriad of people and events. I found myself talking eagerly and enthusiastically.

"Elder, do you remember a man named Copernicus?"

For more than a millennium mens ideas about the universe had been cemented in the theories of the Greeks, of Ptolemy and Aristotle. That is to say, the earth was the center of the universe. Even the Catholic church in the thirteenth century, influenced by St. Thomas Aquinas, had adopted the Aristotelian view that the earth lies right in the middle of the heavens. The dreaded Inquisition managed to silence any radical views that might have been expressed. Then, in A.D. 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a new truth: that the earth rotates daily on its axis and the planets revolve in orbits around the sun. Of this, Martin Luther is reputed to have said, "The fool wants to turn the whole science of astronomy upside down" ("Pioneers in Mans Search for the Universe," &lt;i&gt;National Geographic &lt;/i&gt;145, no. 5 [May 1974]:627). Copernicus did just that, and in so doing set astronomy free.

One man! And today we are awed into humility by the tremendous scope of the universe. Yes, we measure space by light-years, the distance light travels in one year at the rate of 186,282 miles a second. We know that galaxies are as common as blades of grass in a meadow - perhaps over a hundred billion of them. There are distant objects known as quasars, placed at ten billion light years away from the earth, that in one second throw out enough energy to supply all the earths electrical needs for billions of years. And we know of neutron stars whose matter, if contained in a teaspoon, would weigh over a billion tons. The learning goes on and on because of "one man."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thousands Followed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The elder seemed interested. For a moment he had forgotten himself and was listening intently. Therefore, I continued. I know of a man raised in India and educated in England as an attorney. He loved his native land and longed for the time that she would be free from the domination of Great Britain. Most of his life he lived in a mud hut that had no electric lights, no running water, no telephone. He didnt own an automobile, and he never sought or held a public office. By some he was thought to be the most Christ-like person who had ever lived, and yet he was not even a Christian. To India he was the "Mahatma" or "The Great Soul." He described himself as a "self-remade man."

When Britain was struggling for survival against the Axis powers during World War II, and some prominent Indian leaders wanted to revolt and throw off her authority, he said, "We will not steal even our independence." In his efforts to stop the continual fighting between India and Pakistan he often subjected himself to prolonged fasts. During one of those lengthy ordeals a medical doctor tried to get him to take a small portion of beef broth, to which he commented, "Even for life itself we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me - to die, but never to break my pledge." And as they begged him to eat or drink, fearing for his life, for his kidneys had begun to fail, he simply said, "Life is more than science and God more than chemistry" (see Sterling W. Sill, &lt;i&gt;The Glory of the Sun &lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1961], pp. 30910).

Someone has said, "When Cicero speaks, the people say, How eloquent! When Demosthenes speaks, the people say, Come, let us march!" When this humble Indian went out from his house to walk, multitudes followed him. Thousands were willing to submit to death rather than take up arms against their enemies because he did not believe in violence, but rather in the principles of peace and love.

On 30 July 1948, as he hurried to the village prayer ground, blessing the people as he went, a religious fanatic shot and killed him. The Mahatma was gone. His name was Mohandas K. Gandhi. Only one man! Yet through his efforts, India was granted her freedom. The name &lt;i&gt;Gandhi &lt;/i&gt;will live on forever - in the annals of time.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;"In the Hands of Man"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
"You see, Elder, there are men who have truly made a difference."

Yet we must use prudence in our study, for it is possible that evil men can also have a lasting effect upon their fellow beings. A demented Austrian with a view of total world control used his evil genius to disrupt the whole earth. Plunging the civilized world into war, his powerful armies created havoc throughout all of Europe. His regime left behind a path of death and destruction that had few equals in the history of the world. His racial myth of Aryan supremacy was responsible for the mass murder of over six million Jews and many more millions of members of other races, supposedly "inferior" to the Germans. The names of the death camps of Dachau, Buchenwald, and others will long be remembered as horrible proof of the depth of depravity to which supposedly civilized countries may descend. Such atrocities were instigated by one man, Adolf Hitler, who caused himself to be called simply "Der Fuhrer." In a pamphlet written of the tragedy of Dachau, the author said, "Man cannot trust himself in the hands of man" (pamphlet distributed at Dachau).

Truly a man may make a difference, but if he is not guided by the Holy Spirit, but rather by the evil one, he may jeopardize all that is sacred in this life and in the life to come.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Than Any Other Man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The elder sat quietly. Hardly moving. Not speaking. "Are you beginning to understand?" I asked him pointedly.

"I believe I am," he responded. "But, please, dont stop now, President. Go on!" I thought for a moment and then continued.

"Very well. There are two others I would like to tell you about."

On 23 December 1805, a baby boy was born to Joseph and Lucy Smith. They named him after his father. As he grew and developed in mind and in body, schooled in godly principles by his devoted parents, his inquisitive mind sought for religious truth. In response to his humble pleading, the most glorious manifestation ever given to man appeared before him. He saw the living God and Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son. Acting upon their admonitions, one boy (one man) began the incredible task of preparing a way to preach the restored gospel of salvation to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 133:37).

Progress was slow. The translation of sacred records into the Book of Mormon required considerable time and great effort. There were persecutions, killings - every possible delaying tactic conceivable was employed by Satan to stop the work. Still, "having put his hand to the plough" (Luke 9:62), he did not look back. Many followed him. They were driven from place to place. Finding no rest from their tribulations, they relied only on his leadership and their implicit faith in the Savior of Men.

When he was only thirty-nine years old, a bloodthirsty mob stormed a jail in Carthage, Illinois, where he had been imprisoned unjustly, shooting and killing him and his brother Hyrum. His murderers believed that in this way they would stop the work Joseph had begun. But the work did not stop, for it is the work of God. Today, because of one man and his indomitable character for good, the truth is being proclaimed in much of the known world. Of him, Elder John Taylor has said,

&lt;i&gt;Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 135:3]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because He First Loved Us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
"And now I come to the last, yet by far the most significant of all," I said to the young elder.

He was born a babe in Bethlehem of old and placed in a manger by his beautiful virgin mother, Mary. He was the firstborn son in the spirit world and the only begotten son of Eloheim in the flesh. As he grew, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). At the age of thirty he began his public ministry. To the ancient prophet Nephi, an angel said,

&lt;i&gt;Look and behold the condescension of God!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits. . . . And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world. &lt;/i&gt;[1 Nephi 11:2633]

As a resurrected being he proclaimed to the Nephites, on this continent:

&lt;i&gt;And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even &lt;/i&gt;so &lt;i&gt;should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And for this cause have I been lifted up. &lt;/i&gt;[3 Nephi 27:1415]

All this was precipitated by one thing: his infinite love for all of Gods children. The Apostle John said, "We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). One man! - the Son of the Eternal God, who submitted himself to all of these things in order that we, you and I, might live again with the hope of eternal life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Faithful Elder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now I spoke softly to the young missionary with all the fervor of my soul. I placed my hand on his and said, "Are you ready to go back out into the field of labor? Can you make a difference in the lives of these special Bolivian children of our Heavenly Father? Are you ready to once again take up your cross, follow [him], and feed [his] sheep? (D&amp;amp;C 112:14).

It was apparent that his attitude had changed. With a renewed spirit of dedication, tears slipping down his face, he committed himself once again to the work of the Lord. We knelt in prayer together. I blessed him that he would be able to find the way.

Although he had been weak, I felt an inner confidence in him. As I sought to find direction from the Spirit for a new assignment for the elder, I surprised even myself by sending him to one of the most difficult and remote areas of Bolivia - a small community near the Argentine border named Bermejo. The work had gone badly there for some time, with only a few baptisms to reinforce the little handful of Saints who were discouraged and finding it hard to keep the faith.

But the Lord and his ways are wonderful to behold. In his weekly reports to me the missionary told of his diligent efforts to contact the people and preach the gospel to them. He indicated that they were slow to listen, but that he was continuing his faithful stewardship in that part of the Lords vineyard. And then it happened!

Overnight a small river running near the village of Bermejo, fed by heavy rains in the mountains, rose to a height never before known in the history of the land. Homes were swept away; and people were drowned. The only bridge connecting the city to the main road was torn from its footings and washed downstream. Communications were destroyed. There was chaos everywhere. Two young missionaries were caught in the turmoil of death and destruction caused by the flooding waters. And one remembered that "a man can make a difference." He threw himself into the turbulent waters to rescue many who were drowning; he sought for those buried beneath fallen buildings; he gave relief to the injured and succor to the hungry.

And a miracle occurred! He became a hero. He was lauded by the newspapers. His name was spoken over the airwaves. The people mentioned his name with reverence. Those who had previously rejected him and the message he carried now searched him out. Their doors were opened to receive him. They loved him! They accepted his burning testimony of Jesus Christ and the gospel restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In the few months that remained of his mission he brought scores of wonderful people into the Church. He saw the men receive the holy priesthood and their wives become more lovely in Relief Society activity. Today a beautiful chapel stands in Bermejo. On the Sabbath day it is full of people who still remember one faithful elder who made a difference.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Difference Will You Make&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
And now, just for a moment: What can &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;do to make a difference? Each one of those about whom I have spoken paid a price for his remarkable achievements. It seems there is always a price! May I suggest a few methods that will start you on the road to making a difference.

First, attend all three of your Sabbath-day meetings - without fail! Then you will be instructed in principle and truth. You will be reminded of sacred baptismal covenants as you take the Lords sacrament.

Second, pay your tithing and your offerings faithfully. Then you will begin to understand the purpose for the law of sacrifice and the law of consecration.

Third, maintain a resolute firmness in keeping the law of chastity. Then you will be a pure vessel where darkness is removed and where light remains.

Fourth, when you are prepared, go to the Lords house. There you will be taught in the ways of godliness and be prepared to receive a fullness of the priesthood.

Fifth, preach the everlasting gospel in word and deed. Then you will share in the joy of a converted soul - you will understand true joy. And you will win the crown of eternal life.

And what difference will you make? The kingdom of God will be strengthened by your membership. Your character will become as strong as steel. You will be a source of spiritual wisdom and strength to many. And God will love you!

As I look at you, children of Israel, I see the light of truth glowing in your eyes. I know that your desires are good. I pray that you will remember the lives of such great men as Copernicus and Gandhi, that you will not forget what evils can be wrought by men such as Adolph Hitler. I beseech you to think often of Joseph Smith and how his life has affected your own. I humbly remind you of the only pure, sinless life ever lived on this earth, that of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I sincerely confess to you my love for him, I witness that he lives and that he loves us. Seek for him! Be like him! He is the Way, the Light, and the Life. And when you find him, you, too, will make a difference. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I am happy to be with you today, especially as you are beginning a new summer session of study at Brigham Young University. It is pleasing to me to see so many of my dear friends - President Holland, my family, and my mission family, who have come to lend their love and spiritual strength to me on this occasion.</p>
<p>This is a devotional assembly. It is a moment for each of us to think of heavenly things, of things that will build our spiritual strength and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father. I realize, in part, the responsibility that has been placed upon me. Therefore, I seek for the spirit of the Holy Ghost to be with me. And I pray that you, too, will sense my desire and let your faith and prayers be exercised in my behalf.</p>
<p>The famous Christian reformer, Billy Sunday, is quoted as having said that the secret to his success was that "He started a fire in himself and the people came to watch him burn." I feel that I have come with a fire in my heart, kindled by the love that I have for the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that as the Spirit burns in me, this same Spirit will ignite a fire in you. "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;C 50:22).</p>
<h2><b>Because of One Man</b></h2>
<p>Some time ago, while laboring in the Lords missionary service, a wonderful missionary came to see me. It was near the end of his mission. He was very depressed. Saddened by his own perception of personal success, he had imposed upon himself a standard from which he had fallen far short. As he spoke, he recounted for me the difficult time he had experienced in the MTC. While he was there, his father had died unexpectedly, and for a brief period of time the elder had considered leaving the mission and returning home. But, encouraged by a loving mother and spurred on by an individual commitment, he continued his training and finally found himself in the beautiful country of Bolivia.</p>
<p>I listened to him as he told me of the initial efforts he had made in his mission to work hard, pray often, follow all the rules, and be a model missionary - expecting, of course, to be rewarded with hundreds of baptisms. But, unfortunately, the baptisms had not come. Gradually he began to slacken his pace. He felt that his prayers were not being heard, so why pray? The mission rules seemed somehow to be burdensome. They were restrictive, silly things, written by the mission president only to goad and irritate him and the other missionaries.</p>
<p>In despair, he said, "And now Im nobody! What I do wont make any difference!" Then searchingly, he quickly added, "Will it, President Hammond?"</p>
<p>For an instant the same questions passed through my own mind. "Can he make a difference? Can I? Can anyone? Does it matter what one man does?" Then, in my minds eye I saw a myriad of people and events. I found myself talking eagerly and enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Elder, do you remember a man named Copernicus?"</p>
<p>For more than a millennium mens ideas about the universe had been cemented in the theories of the Greeks, of Ptolemy and Aristotle. That is to say, the earth was the center of the universe. Even the Catholic church in the thirteenth century, influenced by St. Thomas Aquinas, had adopted the Aristotelian view that the earth lies right in the middle of the heavens. The dreaded Inquisition managed to silence any radical views that might have been expressed. Then, in A.D. 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a new truth: that the earth rotates daily on its axis and the planets revolve in orbits around the sun. Of this, Martin Luther is reputed to have said, "The fool wants to turn the whole science of astronomy upside down" ("Pioneers in Mans Search for the Universe," <i>National Geographic </i>145, no. 5 [May 1974]:627). Copernicus did just that, and in so doing set astronomy free.</p>
<p>One man! And today we are awed into humility by the tremendous scope of the universe. Yes, we measure space by light-years, the distance light travels in one year at the rate of 186,282 miles a second. We know that galaxies are as common as blades of grass in a meadow - perhaps over a hundred billion of them. There are distant objects known as quasars, placed at ten billion light years away from the earth, that in one second throw out enough energy to supply all the earths electrical needs for billions of years. And we know of neutron stars whose matter, if contained in a teaspoon, would weigh over a billion tons. The learning goes on and on because of "one man."</p>
<h2><b>Thousands Followed</b></h2>
<p>The elder seemed interested. For a moment he had forgotten himself and was listening intently. Therefore, I continued. I know of a man raised in India and educated in England as an attorney. He loved his native land and longed for the time that she would be free from the domination of Great Britain. Most of his life he lived in a mud hut that had no electric lights, no running water, no telephone. He didnt own an automobile, and he never sought or held a public office. By some he was thought to be the most Christ-like person who had ever lived, and yet he was not even a Christian. To India he was the "Mahatma" or "The Great Soul." He described himself as a "self-remade man."</p>
<p>When Britain was struggling for survival against the Axis powers during World War II, and some prominent Indian leaders wanted to revolt and throw off her authority, he said, "We will not steal even our independence." In his efforts to stop the continual fighting between India and Pakistan he often subjected himself to prolonged fasts. During one of those lengthy ordeals a medical doctor tried to get him to take a small portion of beef broth, to which he commented, "Even for life itself we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me - to die, but never to break my pledge." And as they begged him to eat or drink, fearing for his life, for his kidneys had begun to fail, he simply said, "Life is more than science and God more than chemistry" (see Sterling W. Sill, <i>The Glory of the Sun </i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1961], pp. 30910).</p>
<p>Someone has said, "When Cicero speaks, the people say, How eloquent! When Demosthenes speaks, the people say, Come, let us march!" When this humble Indian went out from his house to walk, multitudes followed him. Thousands were willing to submit to death rather than take up arms against their enemies because he did not believe in violence, but rather in the principles of peace and love.</p>
<p>On 30 July 1948, as he hurried to the village prayer ground, blessing the people as he went, a religious fanatic shot and killed him. The Mahatma was gone. His name was Mohandas K. Gandhi. Only one man! Yet through his efforts, India was granted her freedom. The name <i>Gandhi </i>will live on forever - in the annals of time.</p>
<h2><b>"In the Hands of Man"</b></h2>
<p>"You see, Elder, there are men who have truly made a difference."</p>
<p>Yet we must use prudence in our study, for it is possible that evil men can also have a lasting effect upon their fellow beings. A demented Austrian with a view of total world control used his evil genius to disrupt the whole earth. Plunging the civilized world into war, his powerful armies created havoc throughout all of Europe. His regime left behind a path of death and destruction that had few equals in the history of the world. His racial myth of Aryan supremacy was responsible for the mass murder of over six million Jews and many more millions of members of other races, supposedly "inferior" to the Germans. The names of the death camps of Dachau, Buchenwald, and others will long be remembered as horrible proof of the depth of depravity to which supposedly civilized countries may descend. Such atrocities were instigated by one man, Adolf Hitler, who caused himself to be called simply "Der Fuhrer." In a pamphlet written of the tragedy of Dachau, the author said, "Man cannot trust himself in the hands of man" (pamphlet distributed at Dachau).</p>
<p>Truly a man may make a difference, but if he is not guided by the Holy Spirit, but rather by the evil one, he may jeopardize all that is sacred in this life and in the life to come.</p>
<h2><b>More Than Any Other Man</b></h2>
<p>The elder sat quietly. Hardly moving. Not speaking. "Are you beginning to understand?" I asked him pointedly.</p>
<p>"I believe I am," he responded. "But, please, dont stop now, President. Go on!" I thought for a moment and then continued.</p>
<p>"Very well. There are two others I would like to tell you about."</p>
<p>On 23 December 1805, a baby boy was born to Joseph and Lucy Smith. They named him after his father. As he grew and developed in mind and in body, schooled in godly principles by his devoted parents, his inquisitive mind sought for religious truth. In response to his humble pleading, the most glorious manifestation ever given to man appeared before him. He saw the living God and Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son. Acting upon their admonitions, one boy (one man) began the incredible task of preparing a way to preach the restored gospel of salvation to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (D&amp;C 133:37).</p>
<p>Progress was slow. The translation of sacred records into the Book of Mormon required considerable time and great effort. There were persecutions, killings - every possible delaying tactic conceivable was employed by Satan to stop the work. Still, "having put his hand to the plough" (Luke 9:62), he did not look back. Many followed him. They were driven from place to place. Finding no rest from their tribulations, they relied only on his leadership and their implicit faith in the Savior of Men.</p>
<p>When he was only thirty-nine years old, a bloodthirsty mob stormed a jail in Carthage, Illinois, where he had been imprisoned unjustly, shooting and killing him and his brother Hyrum. His murderers believed that in this way they would stop the work Joseph had begun. But the work did not stop, for it is the work of God. Today, because of one man and his indomitable character for good, the truth is being proclaimed in much of the known world. Of him, Elder John Taylor has said,</p>
<p><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. </i>[D&amp;C 135:3]</p>
<h2><b>Because He First Loved Us</b></h2>
<p>"And now I come to the last, yet by far the most significant of all," I said to the young elder.</p>
<p>He was born a babe in Bethlehem of old and placed in a manger by his beautiful virgin mother, Mary. He was the firstborn son in the spirit world and the only begotten son of Eloheim in the flesh. As he grew, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). At the age of thirty he began his public ministry. To the ancient prophet Nephi, an angel said,</p>
<p><i>Look and behold the condescension of God!</i></p>
<p><i>And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits. . . . And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.</i></p>
<p><i>And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world. </i>[1 Nephi 11:2633]</p>
<p>As a resurrected being he proclaimed to the Nephites, on this continent:</p>
<p><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even </i>so <i>should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil - </i></p>
<p><i>And for this cause have I been lifted up. </i>[3 Nephi 27:1415]</p>
<p>All this was precipitated by one thing: his infinite love for all of Gods children. The Apostle John said, "We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). One man! - the Son of the Eternal God, who submitted himself to all of these things in order that we, you and I, might live again with the hope of eternal life.</p>
<h2><b>One Faithful Elder</b></h2>
<p>Now I spoke softly to the young missionary with all the fervor of my soul. I placed my hand on his and said, "Are you ready to go back out into the field of labor? Can you make a difference in the lives of these special Bolivian children of our Heavenly Father? Are you ready to once again take up your cross, follow [him], and feed [his] sheep? (D&amp;C 112:14).</p>
<p>It was apparent that his attitude had changed. With a renewed spirit of dedication, tears slipping down his face, he committed himself once again to the work of the Lord. We knelt in prayer together. I blessed him that he would be able to find the way.</p>
<p>Although he had been weak, I felt an inner confidence in him. As I sought to find direction from the Spirit for a new assignment for the elder, I surprised even myself by sending him to one of the most difficult and remote areas of Bolivia - a small community near the Argentine border named Bermejo. The work had gone badly there for some time, with only a few baptisms to reinforce the little handful of Saints who were discouraged and finding it hard to keep the faith.</p>
<p>But the Lord and his ways are wonderful to behold. In his weekly reports to me the missionary told of his diligent efforts to contact the people and preach the gospel to them. He indicated that they were slow to listen, but that he was continuing his faithful stewardship in that part of the Lords vineyard. And then it happened!</p>
<p>Overnight a small river running near the village of Bermejo, fed by heavy rains in the mountains, rose to a height never before known in the history of the land. Homes were swept away; and people were drowned. The only bridge connecting the city to the main road was torn from its footings and washed downstream. Communications were destroyed. There was chaos everywhere. Two young missionaries were caught in the turmoil of death and destruction caused by the flooding waters. And one remembered that "a man can make a difference." He threw himself into the turbulent waters to rescue many who were drowning; he sought for those buried beneath fallen buildings; he gave relief to the injured and succor to the hungry.</p>
<p>And a miracle occurred! He became a hero. He was lauded by the newspapers. His name was spoken over the airwaves. The people mentioned his name with reverence. Those who had previously rejected him and the message he carried now searched him out. Their doors were opened to receive him. They loved him! They accepted his burning testimony of Jesus Christ and the gospel restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In the few months that remained of his mission he brought scores of wonderful people into the Church. He saw the men receive the holy priesthood and their wives become more lovely in Relief Society activity. Today a beautiful chapel stands in Bermejo. On the Sabbath day it is full of people who still remember one faithful elder who made a difference.</p>
<h2><b>What Difference Will You Make</b></h2>
<p>And now, just for a moment: What can <i>you </i>do to make a difference? Each one of those about whom I have spoken paid a price for his remarkable achievements. It seems there is always a price! May I suggest a few methods that will start you on the road to making a difference.</p>
<p>First, attend all three of your Sabbath-day meetings - without fail! Then you will be instructed in principle and truth. You will be reminded of sacred baptismal covenants as you take the Lords sacrament.</p>
<p>Second, pay your tithing and your offerings faithfully. Then you will begin to understand the purpose for the law of sacrifice and the law of consecration.</p>
<p>Third, maintain a resolute firmness in keeping the law of chastity. Then you will be a pure vessel where darkness is removed and where light remains.</p>
<p>Fourth, when you are prepared, go to the Lords house. There you will be taught in the ways of godliness and be prepared to receive a fullness of the priesthood.</p>
<p>Fifth, preach the everlasting gospel in word and deed. Then you will share in the joy of a converted soul - you will understand true joy. And you will win the crown of eternal life.</p>
<p>And what difference will you make? The kingdom of God will be strengthened by your membership. Your character will become as strong as steel. You will be a source of spiritual wisdom and strength to many. And God will love you!</p>
<p>As I look at you, children of Israel, I see the light of truth glowing in your eyes. I know that your desires are good. I pray that you will remember the lives of such great men as Copernicus and Gandhi, that you will not forget what evils can be wrought by men such as Adolph Hitler. I beseech you to think often of Joseph Smith and how his life has affected your own. I humbly remind you of the only pure, sinless life ever lived on this earth, that of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I sincerely confess to you my love for him, I witness that he lives and that he loves us. Seek for him! Be like him! He is the Way, the Light, and the Life. And when you find him, you, too, will make a difference. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Shortly after accepting my job at BYU, I called Elder Jeffrey R. Hollands office to ask if he would do the voice-over for an athletics commercial during the height of Jimmermania. Because of my football career I had gotten to know Elder Holland, and I thought he would be the perfect person, with his distinctive voice, for the job.
Then I had a meeting with Tom Holmoe, BYUs athletic director, and I let him know how excited I was about the possibility of including Elder Holland in our project. I naively assumed that Tom would be thrilled about my phone call and invitation.
I was wrong. It was a major faux pas. He let me know that any invitation to one of the leaders of the Church needed to go through the president of the school. I quickly wrote an apology to President Samuelson, and this was his inspiring reply:
Chad,
No need to worry. We sometimes forget to inform those coming into BYU employment of the unique way things are done at BYU, particularly when it relates to contacts and requests of the senior Brethren. You are like those guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom because no one ever taught them the gospel. We probably should not take this one up the line, but feel free to raise any good ideas you have. Sorry we didnt loop you in earlier. I know Elder Hollands only concern would be disappointing you. Know that you are loved and appreciated. All the best.
Cec
I love that letter. It is a shining example of my topic today: "The World Needs to See and Feel Your Light." What does President Samuelsons letter, with his good-natured correction for me, have to do with this theme? Everything! How do you think it made me feel as a new BYU employee to receive that letter? It inspired me. He didnt crush me with his authority; it was just the opposite. I could feel his light and the love he had for me.
As I share my thoughts with you today, I hope to better prepare you for tomorrow. Many of you will run your own companies. You may hold positions of leadership. You would be wise to follow President Samuelsons great example of how to correct and inspire others.
President Samuelson has tried to respond to every email from every student. Think of the encouragement and faith that he has shared with you and other students over the last eleven years. He has certainly followed the counsel of the Savior to let his light shine. He and Sister Samuelson are awesome, and I will miss my association with them. President Kevin Worthen and his wife, Peggy, will likewise win your hearts and earn your respect as they serve you. I know President Worthen and have complete confidence in him.
Our Savior Jesus Christ said, "Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 12:16). That is my favorite scripture. Let your light shine.
When President Thomas S.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a glorious sight you are! Its an honor, my young friends, to be here with you. I feel the tremendous weight of the responsibility which is mine to provide you with a message which will hopefully be helpful to you not only for today but, indeed, throughout your lives.
As I gaze at this vast audience, Im reminded that each of you is one of a kind. Each has had experiences unique to you and you alone. You have come to Brigham Young University from locations across the country and the world. You come from varied backgrounds. And yet there is much that we have in common one with another. We know where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we leave this life. We know that we are children of our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. We know we want to return to Him after we leave this earthly existence. We know that what we do - and dont do - here in mortality is of utmost importance. We also know that, should we fall short, our Savior has provided us with the precious gift of the Atonement and that, if we change our lives and our hearts and take advantage of the power of the Atonement, our sins and shortcomings will be forgiven and forgotten.
We have in common the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we know it is our responsibility to share the truths of the gospel with others. One of the chief ways in which we can share the gospel is to be a righteous example, and it is about this that I wish to speak to you today. The Apostle Paul admonished, "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."1 He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be "as lights in the world."2
This is what I would hope for each of us - that we might be a light to the world.
What is light? Websters dictionary lists no less than fifteen definitions for the noun light. I prefer the simple "something that illuminates." Just as turning on a light switch in a dark room will bathe the room in light, so providing an example of righteousness - and therefore being a light - can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.
Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. Said President Harold B. Lee:
Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God - that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed. Moroni spoke of [that light,] that Spirit when he said:
"For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. And, I have to say, you are an awesome sight! My oldest daughter, Mackenzie, is graduating today, so I am especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy our family experiences through having children attend BYU.
Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:
I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually. ["Your Gifts Bless Generations," insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]
I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I hope you feel that as well.
Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed many tests - some academic and some in other aspects of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.
It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when
Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. "It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, What have I done? and, What do I do now?" he recalls. "I found myself on my knees within minutes."
Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD 78). Edwards set a chair directly in front of Mendenhalls chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.
"[LaVell Edwards] first words were You have a tough job. Then there was a pause and silence," says Mendenhall. "It wasnt very comforting to hear that. But then [LaVell] just said, But its a great job. I didnt know what he meant by either at the time."
Mendenhall has come to consider [Coach] Edwards a mentor and an advocate. "Its nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what its like to be a head coach here." The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be. [Peter B. Gardner, "The Bronco Way," BYU Magazine, winter 2007, 2223]
Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, co</span>

Perhaps you would also like to know, if you dont already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monsons close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because Im sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, Id like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didnt know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions a</span>
