  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I’m delighted to have this opportunity. Every time I come on this great campus a thrill runs through my soul as I mingle with you great young people. Seems like it’s always a homecoming too. I see so many of you out there—good Bostonians, good New Yorkers. Isn’t it great to have that representation here. I’m sure it influences and sweetens the campus here to have some of that good Eastern blood.

As I approach this subject today, you may find it to be a mixture of a businessman’s approach and a churchman’s musings. I think that wherever we find truth it’s our responsibility to uphold it and defend it. I’d like to start by just reading a scripture to you that’s found in the book of Matthew:

&lt;i&gt;There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?&lt;/i&gt; [Matthew 26:7–8]

Now I know in our lives there are times it’s difficult to determine whether it’s a benefit or a waste, but most times the distinction is clearly evident between the two. In the scripture just quoted, the Savior approved of that which was done and blessed the woman who anointed him. However, to his disciples, seeing that costly anointment, it appeared to be a waste. Today I’d like to talk to you about waste. With our ever increasing population and the depletion of our natural resources, our great hope is to become more efficient in utilizing that which the Lord has given to us and in eliminating the waste so prevalent in our society.

You see, I’m not very proud of my generation and some of the things that they have done. During the time that our nation has been under the leadership of this generation, I would guess that it’s become the most wasteful in all of the world. I just can’t believe my eyes sometimes as I read the paper and try to understand our approach to solving the problems that beset our nation today. I was very proud of the generation that I belong to until recent years. They appeared to have made some great contributions to mankind. Then, all of a sudden, they seemed to fall apart. After reaching a peak and becoming the richest and most powerful nation on earth, we appear, as they say in business, to have “topped off.” We now find ourselves turning over to your leadership a nation a few ways better but for the most part in a poorer condition than the one which was given to us. I’d like to reminisce for just a few minutes, to see if we can determine what has caused our failures.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Depression and the War&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My generation had its beginnings during the great depression. We witnessed the concern of our parents as they worried about supplying us with the basic needs of life. We witnessed the waste of inactive people standing in bread lines or leaning on shovels in WPA projects. I remember marveling, as a young man, at my mother’s ability to make things stretch. I guess I had the easiest job on the block when it came to carrying out the garbage cans. The neighbors would always carry out two or three big ones. Ours was a small size, usually only half-full. The great cities would not be having the problems they have today with their garbage if all the residents were as frugal as my mother. Almost everything she processed was either biodegradable or reuseable.

About the time the great depression showed signs of fading away, our great country was disgraced at Pearl Harbor. We were just the right age to take up arms and go to fight to preserve our freedoms.

For the next several years, we witnessed firsthand the waste of destruction. We sat on the fantails of troop ships and listened to chaplains prepare us to meet our Maker as they would tell us frankly what the odds were that we would be alive at noon the following day. We were very close to our God; we pleaded to him for strength. How those prayers were answered, to give us strength and a great inner source of faith as we would go over the side and down those long cargo nets into the landing craft which would carry us to a hostile island.

Then one night a guard came running up the rows of tents where we were sleeping, shouting that he had just heard over the radio the war was over. We literally jumped through our mosquito nets and ran to the one and only radio we had, located in the mess hall. By the time we arrived, the armed forces radio was broadcasting a New York Yankee baseball game. Can you imagine our disappointment to have to listen to a baseball game when such exciting news was about to come forth? We sat glued to the radio all night, but no news came. We even changed stations to see if Tokyo Rose would be good enough to give us the announcement, but she continued on her same theme. It was two days later when we noticed in the harbor shots of tracers being fired into the air, and the big guns trained out to sea set off a fireworks display to announce the end.

A few days later we were on our way to see the waste and destruction of our efforts. Our ship dropped anchor in Nagasaki harbor and we rushed topside to look at the results of an atomic bomb. Sickened by the sight, our souls were cleansed from the hate which had been built up in our hearts against our enemies during those years of battle. As we saw the destruction of this great city, smelled the stench of the dead, and heard the cries of the orphans, our hearts mellowed and we reached out to help them rebuild that which we had destroyed.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materialism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I must say we were impressed with the initiative of the Japanese. The first day we were in the city, they had set up little stands to sell Japanese fans imprinted with the American flag. I guess they must have been manufacturing them for months, realizing that the end of the war was near, that there would be a new tourist trade coming in in the form of occupation troops.

I believe this was our finest hour. We worked hard to rebuild the world. We were the richest and most powerful nation on earth. Our currency was the standard of the world. We couldn’t work long enough or hard enough to supply the needs of those who desired our services or the goods we could export. The more we helped others, the richer we became. This was our zenith. We were so accomplished that we found ourselves not needing our God quite as much as we did when we were sitting on the fantails of those ships. In fact, we found him getting in our way on occasion. Materialism started to give us more satisfaction than religion. Soon we found ourselves without that same patriotic spirit that had propelled us out of the world to help save it and to build a better place for all mankind. We divided ourselves into special interest groups and were selfish and self-centered. Our chief interest became centered on having a big home, two cars in the garage, campers, trailers, boats, foreign vacations, fancy bars, rich food, etc. We were convinced that there was no end to that which we could produce to supply our never-ending appetites. Waste became a way of life.

Now let us examine some of the ways that our thinking changed and we started on a new approach as we would attack our problems.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dishonesty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I guess the first area would be that of dishonesty. We found ourselves unable to satisfy our needs fast enough. We looked at our employers and decided we were not getting enough for the efforts we were putting in. We didn’t want to work as hard as we had been. We needed more time for TV, longer coffee breaks, extra time during lunch periods to go shopping, and so on. We wanted more for less. When it was not given to us, we decided to find alternative ways to take it. So we slowed down our production; we would take sick leave even though we were not ill. We’d find some excuse to take an extra day or two on vacations. If we felt that we were not being paid enough, we would steal from our employers to make up the difference.

And the reaction of our employers was most remarkable. They sat in their secluded offices asking the question: “To what purpose is this waste?” Their conclusions were astounding. Rather than seeking to eliminate, they condoned! It required less effort to add a few dollars to the cost of the goods to cover the waste of dishonesty rather than to instill integrity in their employees. After all, we were the biggest and the best in the world. Everyone wanted our goods. A dollar or two on the cost would not affect them that much.

Our cost of production started to spiral time and time again. One day we were shocked to find that the demand for our goods in foreign markets had slowed down. We were further shocked to find that those nations we had defeated in battle and helped rebuild now had the nerve and the gall to produce products better than ours at a lower cost. Soon our imports exceeded our exports, and rapidly we were no longer the richest nation on earth. West Germany, the nation we had defeated and leveled to the ground and had helped rebuild, now had that honor. The mark and the yen in world money markets were making our currency look rather ridiculous. The Japanese had copied our ways and our big cities and our industrial plants, looked over what we were doing, eliminated the waste that they found in our operations, and were offering our products manufactured in their country at less cost than we could produce them.

I remember a personal experience in dealing with a Japanese manufacturer. One of the divisions that reported to me when I worked in New York was a large shoe warehouse. We warehoused over a million pair of shoes. We had been purchasing most of them from New England sources until the waste of their operation priced them out of the market. We resolved to try the Japanese market and decided to try with a gym shoe that one of our U.S. manufacturers had been producing for us. We sent an order to Japan to compare the costs. We had a frugal shoe buyer who decided not to send a good pair, but he had a defective one that had a little marking on the heel of the left shoe. The Japanese firm agreed to produce the shoes at much less cost for us, and so the order was placed for 3,000 pairs of gym shoes. When the shoes, all 3,000 pairs, were delivered to us, they were exact copies of the American shoe in every detail, including the flaw on the left heel.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pollution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I think the next area we’ve had difficulty in is that of the waste of pollution. My generation was productive and even inspired in the field of invention. We saw the immediate needs of the population and satisfied those needs in an impressive fashion. However, our genius may have been premature on many occasions. We forgot, in our excitement, the total effects of these inventions compiled after years of use. Merely from looking at our polluted air and rivers we come to realize that possibly we implemented in haste without looking to the future. My generation gratified those immediate needs through all sorts of mechanical innovations to produce comfort. But in so doing, we forgot and possibly indelibly marked the sweet, quiet, natural comforts of this world that God has placed for us. My son, after coming back to Utah—I’m sure he couldn’t have done this in the East—thought it wise to write a little poem on air and pollution. [Lee, will you excuse me while I quote here for a minute? I don’t think he knows I have this.]

&lt;i&gt;Air&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Air comes from a complicated&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;chemical occurrence&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And continues to bless us&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with ceaseless abundance.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But what if one day&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The air left with rain,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How could we convince it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To come back again?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The air would complain,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Why,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you creatures must hate me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There’s smoke and smog&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As far as you can see,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And people don’t care&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Enough to stop smoking.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Just one cigarette&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Depresses me choking.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And nobody stops a moment to ponder &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If enough air exists in expanses out yonder. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Up buildings,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;down trees,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Air comes with the breeze.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Life is forever&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;An end?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, never.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Why look at me,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I’m breathing with ease.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“There ought to be laws,”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;says a lawyer.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“There ought to be ways,”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;says a chemist.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Where are the clean rivers?”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;asks Tom Sawyer.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Why,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the plants are all dying,”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;claims a botanist.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A clean river formed the Grand Canyon. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tall trees were chopped by Paul Bunyan. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You and I ignited this war&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The moment&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we decided to pour&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The wastes of the day&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On the world&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in a reckless way.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Why,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you can’t see the sun anymore.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And nobody stops a moment to ponder&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Up buildings,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;down trees,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Air comes with the breeze.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Life is forever&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;An end?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, never.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Why look at me,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I’m breathing with ease.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I think the whole problem &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Stems from the fact&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That air is abundant,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Too abundant to lack.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It’s always been there &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Since the world was created, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But a wholesome-type air &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Will soon be outdated.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And nobody stops a moment to ponder&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Up buildings,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;down trees,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Air comes with the breeze.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Life is forever&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;An end?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, never.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Why look at me,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I’m breathing with ease.&lt;/i&gt;

[Now, Lee, you’d think with all that literary genius that you have you’d get off that plateau you’re on in your grade level. He consistently sends home report cards 3.9.]

When we consider pollution, again we must ask the question: For what purpose is this waste?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gifts of the Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now I think we must consider the gifts of the Spirit. I’m certain that as serious as the problems of dishonesty, pollution, and waste are, my generation will be condemned more for turning their backs on the faith of their forefathers. How often history has repeated the story that replacing the gifts of the Spirit with the desires of materialism brings only heartache and disappointment. Do you remember in the Book of Mormon the account of the wicked King Noah—how Zeniff, his father, conferred the kingdom on Noah? Then the scripture records that he didn’t walk in the ways of his father:

&lt;i&gt;For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 11:2]

Then he set about to tax the people, and he laid a tax of one-fifth on all that they possessed, their gold, their silver, copper, brass, iron, their fatlings of the flock, and a fifth of their grain. And he brought all this in for the support of himself and those who were living immoral lives with him. And those priests that would murmur against him he cast aside and consecrated new ones in their stead, and he went out and found those that had pride in their hearts to be his priests. And then the scripture records:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, by the taxes which king Noah had put on his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 11:6]

Well, Noah’s reign lasted about fifteen years before his people turned against him and burned him. Time has a way of catching up on those who refuse to keep the commandments of God and who walk after the desires of their own hearts.

As serious as pollution of our highways, rivers, lakes, and streams may be, pollution of the mind and spirit is far more detrimental. When this occurs, an individual loses his ability to devise clear ways of solving problems.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepare for the Day of Your Generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I have given you the analysis of the rise and fall of the generation to which I belong. We are almost at the end of our leadership reign. Now you prepare for the day of your generation. Your beginnings are not going to be much different from ours. The cycle that we started at the bottom went to the top, appears to have reached its peak, and has started down at a rapid rate. In all probability, you will start close to the bottom again.

My challenge to you today is not only to develop understanding, knowledge, and expertise in your chosen field, but also to gain an understanding of certain eternal principles that are basic to all positions of good leadership. To follow them will bring about a righteous accomplishment. To violate them will bring only heartache and despair.

Answer in your own hearts, “For what purpose is this waste?” For what purpose is the waste of dishonesty—of cheating yourselves and those with whom you work with dishonest acts? Or the waste of pollution—of environment and mind? Or denying the gifts of the Spirit? Isn’t there one generation or one group of leaders who will be intelligent enough to look at the signs of the past and establish righteous principles that will endure and guide them in the future? I pray to God that you may supply that leadership. I pray that you may have the same righteous desires in your hearts that Alma in the Book of Mormon had when he cried:

&lt;i&gt;O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yea, I would declare to every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto their God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 29:1–2]

The righteous desires of Alma should not be foreign to you. You have been blessed with a greater knowledge of the gospel than any generation before you has possessed. Now the question is, Do you have the courage to stand up and be counted for that which you know to be right? Do you have the courage to steer a straight course when worldly pressures surround you and offer you a seemingly easier and softer and more comfortable way of life? Can you be honest in your dealings with your fellowmen? Are you willing to go beyond that which is required of you and exercise your influence in bringing about honest practices? Have you the courage to set an example of right, of truth, and of justice? Are you strong enough to say no to a short-term gain when the long-range effects will damage future generations? Are you willing to enter into a partnership with the Lord and allow him to have controlling interest? Are you willing to follow his counsel and follow his direction?

Now, as I stand here today, I have no doubts concerning your potential. There has never been a better trained, a more enthusiastic generation and a more determined group than we now find in the young adult members of our Church. I challenge you today to use those tools with which you have been blessed and those you are now acquiring through your education, to be a builder in our Father in heaven’s kingdom. How desperately the world needs a generation of righteous individuals who are willing to stand up on their feet and do that which our Father in heaven would require of them—not to be tempted, beguiled, in the ways of materialism, but to be willing to make sacrifices for that which they know to be right.

I bear solemn testimony to you that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have a powerful and vigorous leader who is the mouthpiece of God on earth today. I know him to be an inspired leader who is receiving that direction and guidance from our Father in heaven. Let us be found on his side, supporting that which he knows to be right and you in your hearts know to be right. And let this influence, which is here present, spread throughout the world, inspiring many to live better lives, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I’m delighted to have this opportunity. Every time I come on this great campus a thrill runs through my soul as I mingle with you great young people. Seems like it’s always a homecoming too. I see so many of you out there—good Bostonians, good New Yorkers. Isn’t it great to have that representation here. I’m sure it influences and sweetens the campus here to have some of that good Eastern blood.</p>
<p>As I approach this subject today, you may find it to be a mixture of a businessman’s approach and a churchman’s musings. I think that wherever we find truth it’s our responsibility to uphold it and defend it. I’d like to start by just reading a scripture to you that’s found in the book of Matthew:</p>
<p><i>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</i></p>
<p><i>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</i> [Matthew 26:7–8]</p>
<p>Now I know in our lives there are times it’s difficult to determine whether it’s a benefit or a waste, but most times the distinction is clearly evident between the two. In the scripture just quoted, the Savior approved of that which was done and blessed the woman who anointed him. However, to his disciples, seeing that costly anointment, it appeared to be a waste. Today I’d like to talk to you about waste. With our ever increasing population and the depletion of our natural resources, our great hope is to become more efficient in utilizing that which the Lord has given to us and in eliminating the waste so prevalent in our society.</p>
<p>You see, I’m not very proud of my generation and some of the things that they have done. During the time that our nation has been under the leadership of this generation, I would guess that it’s become the most wasteful in all of the world. I just can’t believe my eyes sometimes as I read the paper and try to understand our approach to solving the problems that beset our nation today. I was very proud of the generation that I belong to until recent years. They appeared to have made some great contributions to mankind. Then, all of a sudden, they seemed to fall apart. After reaching a peak and becoming the richest and most powerful nation on earth, we appear, as they say in business, to have “topped off.” We now find ourselves turning over to your leadership a nation a few ways better but for the most part in a poorer condition than the one which was given to us. I’d like to reminisce for just a few minutes, to see if we can determine what has caused our failures.</p>
<h2><b>The Depression and the War</b></h2>
<p>My generation had its beginnings during the great depression. We witnessed the concern of our parents as they worried about supplying us with the basic needs of life. We witnessed the waste of inactive people standing in bread lines or leaning on shovels in WPA projects. I remember marveling, as a young man, at my mother’s ability to make things stretch. I guess I had the easiest job on the block when it came to carrying out the garbage cans. The neighbors would always carry out two or three big ones. Ours was a small size, usually only half-full. The great cities would not be having the problems they have today with their garbage if all the residents were as frugal as my mother. Almost everything she processed was either biodegradable or reuseable.</p>
<p>About the time the great depression showed signs of fading away, our great country was disgraced at Pearl Harbor. We were just the right age to take up arms and go to fight to preserve our freedoms.</p>
<p>For the next several years, we witnessed firsthand the waste of destruction. We sat on the fantails of troop ships and listened to chaplains prepare us to meet our Maker as they would tell us frankly what the odds were that we would be alive at noon the following day. We were very close to our God; we pleaded to him for strength. How those prayers were answered, to give us strength and a great inner source of faith as we would go over the side and down those long cargo nets into the landing craft which would carry us to a hostile island.</p>
<p>Then one night a guard came running up the rows of tents where we were sleeping, shouting that he had just heard over the radio the war was over. We literally jumped through our mosquito nets and ran to the one and only radio we had, located in the mess hall. By the time we arrived, the armed forces radio was broadcasting a New York Yankee baseball game. Can you imagine our disappointment to have to listen to a baseball game when such exciting news was about to come forth? We sat glued to the radio all night, but no news came. We even changed stations to see if Tokyo Rose would be good enough to give us the announcement, but she continued on her same theme. It was two days later when we noticed in the harbor shots of tracers being fired into the air, and the big guns trained out to sea set off a fireworks display to announce the end.</p>
<p>A few days later we were on our way to see the waste and destruction of our efforts. Our ship dropped anchor in Nagasaki harbor and we rushed topside to look at the results of an atomic bomb. Sickened by the sight, our souls were cleansed from the hate which had been built up in our hearts against our enemies during those years of battle. As we saw the destruction of this great city, smelled the stench of the dead, and heard the cries of the orphans, our hearts mellowed and we reached out to help them rebuild that which we had destroyed.</p>
<h2><b>Materialism</b></h2>
<p>I must say we were impressed with the initiative of the Japanese. The first day we were in the city, they had set up little stands to sell Japanese fans imprinted with the American flag. I guess they must have been manufacturing them for months, realizing that the end of the war was near, that there would be a new tourist trade coming in in the form of occupation troops.</p>
<p>I believe this was our finest hour. We worked hard to rebuild the world. We were the richest and most powerful nation on earth. Our currency was the standard of the world. We couldn’t work long enough or hard enough to supply the needs of those who desired our services or the goods we could export. The more we helped others, the richer we became. This was our zenith. We were so accomplished that we found ourselves not needing our God quite as much as we did when we were sitting on the fantails of those ships. In fact, we found him getting in our way on occasion. Materialism started to give us more satisfaction than religion. Soon we found ourselves without that same patriotic spirit that had propelled us out of the world to help save it and to build a better place for all mankind. We divided ourselves into special interest groups and were selfish and self-centered. Our chief interest became centered on having a big home, two cars in the garage, campers, trailers, boats, foreign vacations, fancy bars, rich food, etc. We were convinced that there was no end to that which we could produce to supply our never-ending appetites. Waste became a way of life.</p>
<p>Now let us examine some of the ways that our thinking changed and we started on a new approach as we would attack our problems.</p>
<h2><b>Dishonesty</b></h2>
<p>I guess the first area would be that of dishonesty. We found ourselves unable to satisfy our needs fast enough. We looked at our employers and decided we were not getting enough for the efforts we were putting in. We didn’t want to work as hard as we had been. We needed more time for TV, longer coffee breaks, extra time during lunch periods to go shopping, and so on. We wanted more for less. When it was not given to us, we decided to find alternative ways to take it. So we slowed down our production; we would take sick leave even though we were not ill. We’d find some excuse to take an extra day or two on vacations. If we felt that we were not being paid enough, we would steal from our employers to make up the difference.</p>
<p>And the reaction of our employers was most remarkable. They sat in their secluded offices asking the question: “To what purpose is this waste?” Their conclusions were astounding. Rather than seeking to eliminate, they condoned! It required less effort to add a few dollars to the cost of the goods to cover the waste of dishonesty rather than to instill integrity in their employees. After all, we were the biggest and the best in the world. Everyone wanted our goods. A dollar or two on the cost would not affect them that much.</p>
<p>Our cost of production started to spiral time and time again. One day we were shocked to find that the demand for our goods in foreign markets had slowed down. We were further shocked to find that those nations we had defeated in battle and helped rebuild now had the nerve and the gall to produce products better than ours at a lower cost. Soon our imports exceeded our exports, and rapidly we were no longer the richest nation on earth. West Germany, the nation we had defeated and leveled to the ground and had helped rebuild, now had that honor. The mark and the yen in world money markets were making our currency look rather ridiculous. The Japanese had copied our ways and our big cities and our industrial plants, looked over what we were doing, eliminated the waste that they found in our operations, and were offering our products manufactured in their country at less cost than we could produce them.</p>
<p>I remember a personal experience in dealing with a Japanese manufacturer. One of the divisions that reported to me when I worked in New York was a large shoe warehouse. We warehoused over a million pair of shoes. We had been purchasing most of them from New England sources until the waste of their operation priced them out of the market. We resolved to try the Japanese market and decided to try with a gym shoe that one of our U.S. manufacturers had been producing for us. We sent an order to Japan to compare the costs. We had a frugal shoe buyer who decided not to send a good pair, but he had a defective one that had a little marking on the heel of the left shoe. The Japanese firm agreed to produce the shoes at much less cost for us, and so the order was placed for 3,000 pairs of gym shoes. When the shoes, all 3,000 pairs, were delivered to us, they were exact copies of the American shoe in every detail, including the flaw on the left heel.</p>
<h2><b>Pollution</b></h2>
<p>I think the next area we’ve had difficulty in is that of the waste of pollution. My generation was productive and even inspired in the field of invention. We saw the immediate needs of the population and satisfied those needs in an impressive fashion. However, our genius may have been premature on many occasions. We forgot, in our excitement, the total effects of these inventions compiled after years of use. Merely from looking at our polluted air and rivers we come to realize that possibly we implemented in haste without looking to the future. My generation gratified those immediate needs through all sorts of mechanical innovations to produce comfort. But in so doing, we forgot and possibly indelibly marked the sweet, quiet, natural comforts of this world that God has placed for us. My son, after coming back to Utah—I’m sure he couldn’t have done this in the East—thought it wise to write a little poem on air and pollution. [Lee, will you excuse me while I quote here for a minute? I don’t think he knows I have this.]</p>
<p><i>Air</i></p>
<p><i>Air comes from a complicated</i><br />
<i>chemical occurrence</i><br />
<i>And continues to bless us</i><br />
<i>with ceaseless abundance.</i><br />
<i>But what if one day</i><br />
<i>The air left with rain,</i><br />
<i>How could we convince it</i><br />
<i>To come back again?</i><br />
<i>The air would complain,</i><br />
<i>“Why,</i><br />
<i>you creatures must hate me.</i><br />
<i>There’s smoke and smog</i><br />
<i>As far as you can see,</i><br />
<i>And people don’t care</i><br />
<i>Enough to stop smoking.</i><br />
<i>Just one cigarette</i><br />
<i>Depresses me choking.”</i></p>
<p><i>And nobody stops a moment to ponder </i><br />
<i>If enough air exists in expanses out yonder. </i><br />
<i>Up buildings,</i><br />
<i>down trees,</i><br />
<i>Air comes with the breeze.</i><br />
<i>Life is forever</i><br />
<i>An end?</i><br />
<i>Oh, never.</i><br />
<i>Why look at me,</i><br />
<i>I’m breathing with ease.</i></p>
<p><i>“There ought to be laws,”</i><br />
<i>says a lawyer.</i><br />
<i>“There ought to be ways,”</i><br />
<i>says a chemist.</i><br />
<i>“Where are the clean rivers?”</i><br />
<i>asks Tom Sawyer.</i><br />
<i>“Why,</i><br />
<i>the plants are all dying,”</i><br />
<i>claims a botanist.</i></p>
<p><i>A clean river formed the Grand Canyon. </i><br />
<i>Tall trees were chopped by Paul Bunyan. </i><br />
<i>You and I ignited this war</i><br />
<i>The moment</i><br />
<i>we decided to pour</i><br />
<i>The wastes of the day</i><br />
<i>On the world</i><br />
<i>in a reckless way.</i><br />
<i>Why,</i><br />
<i>you can’t see the sun anymore.</i></p>
<p><i>And nobody stops a moment to ponder</i><br />
<i>If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.</i><br />
<i>Up buildings,</i><br />
<i>down trees,</i><br />
<i>Air comes with the breeze.</i><br />
<i>Life is forever</i><br />
<i>An end?</i><br />
<i>Oh, never.</i><br />
<i>Why look at me,</i><br />
<i>I’m breathing with ease.</i></p>
<p><i>I think the whole problem </i><br />
<i>Stems from the fact</i><br />
<i>That air is abundant,</i><br />
<i>Too abundant to lack.</i><br />
<i>It’s always been there </i><br />
<i>Since the world was created, </i><br />
<i>But a wholesome-type air </i><br />
<i>Will soon be outdated.</i></p>
<p><i>And nobody stops a moment to ponder</i><br />
<i>If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.</i><br />
<i>Up buildings,</i><br />
<i>down trees,</i><br />
<i>Air comes with the breeze.</i><br />
<i>Life is forever</i><br />
<i>An end?</i><br />
<i>Oh, never.</i><br />
<i>Why look at me,</i><br />
<i>I’m breathing with ease.</i></p>
<p>[Now, Lee, you’d think with all that literary genius that you have you’d get off that plateau you’re on in your grade level. He consistently sends home report cards 3.9.]</p>
<p>When we consider pollution, again we must ask the question: For what purpose is this waste?</p>
<h2><b>Gifts of the Spirit</b></h2>
<p>Now I think we must consider the gifts of the Spirit. I’m certain that as serious as the problems of dishonesty, pollution, and waste are, my generation will be condemned more for turning their backs on the faith of their forefathers. How often history has repeated the story that replacing the gifts of the Spirit with the desires of materialism brings only heartache and disappointment. Do you remember in the Book of Mormon the account of the wicked King Noah—how Zeniff, his father, conferred the kingdom on Noah? Then the scripture records that he didn’t walk in the ways of his father:</p>
<p><i>For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</i> [Mosiah 11:2]</p>
<p>Then he set about to tax the people, and he laid a tax of one-fifth on all that they possessed, their gold, their silver, copper, brass, iron, their fatlings of the flock, and a fifth of their grain. And he brought all this in for the support of himself and those who were living immoral lives with him. And those priests that would murmur against him he cast aside and consecrated new ones in their stead, and he went out and found those that had pride in their hearts to be his priests. And then the scripture records:</p>
<p><i>Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, by the taxes which king Noah had put on his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.</i> [Mosiah 11:6]</p>
<p>Well, Noah’s reign lasted about fifteen years before his people turned against him and burned him. Time has a way of catching up on those who refuse to keep the commandments of God and who walk after the desires of their own hearts.</p>
<p>As serious as pollution of our highways, rivers, lakes, and streams may be, pollution of the mind and spirit is far more detrimental. When this occurs, an individual loses his ability to devise clear ways of solving problems.</p>
<h2><b>Prepare for the Day of Your Generation</b></h2>
<p>I have given you the analysis of the rise and fall of the generation to which I belong. We are almost at the end of our leadership reign. Now you prepare for the day of your generation. Your beginnings are not going to be much different from ours. The cycle that we started at the bottom went to the top, appears to have reached its peak, and has started down at a rapid rate. In all probability, you will start close to the bottom again.</p>
<p>My challenge to you today is not only to develop understanding, knowledge, and expertise in your chosen field, but also to gain an understanding of certain eternal principles that are basic to all positions of good leadership. To follow them will bring about a righteous accomplishment. To violate them will bring only heartache and despair.</p>
<p>Answer in your own hearts, “For what purpose is this waste?” For what purpose is the waste of dishonesty—of cheating yourselves and those with whom you work with dishonest acts? Or the waste of pollution—of environment and mind? Or denying the gifts of the Spirit? Isn’t there one generation or one group of leaders who will be intelligent enough to look at the signs of the past and establish righteous principles that will endure and guide them in the future? I pray to God that you may supply that leadership. I pray that you may have the same righteous desires in your hearts that Alma in the Book of Mormon had when he cried:</p>
<p><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i></p>
<p><i>Yea, I would declare to every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto their God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i> [Alma 29:1–2]</p>
<p>The righteous desires of Alma should not be foreign to you. You have been blessed with a greater knowledge of the gospel than any generation before you has possessed. Now the question is, Do you have the courage to stand up and be counted for that which you know to be right? Do you have the courage to steer a straight course when worldly pressures surround you and offer you a seemingly easier and softer and more comfortable way of life? Can you be honest in your dealings with your fellowmen? Are you willing to go beyond that which is required of you and exercise your influence in bringing about honest practices? Have you the courage to set an example of right, of truth, and of justice? Are you strong enough to say no to a short-term gain when the long-range effects will damage future generations? Are you willing to enter into a partnership with the Lord and allow him to have controlling interest? Are you willing to follow his counsel and follow his direction?</p>
<p>Now, as I stand here today, I have no doubts concerning your potential. There has never been a better trained, a more enthusiastic generation and a more determined group than we now find in the young adult members of our Church. I challenge you today to use those tools with which you have been blessed and those you are now acquiring through your education, to be a builder in our Father in heaven’s kingdom. How desperately the world needs a generation of righteous individuals who are willing to stand up on their feet and do that which our Father in heaven would require of them—not to be tempted, beguiled, in the ways of materialism, but to be willing to make sacrifices for that which they know to be right.</p>
<p>I bear solemn testimony to you that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have a powerful and vigorous leader who is the mouthpiece of God on earth today. I know him to be an inspired leader who is receiving that direction and guidance from our Father in heaven. Let us be found on his side, supporting that which he knows to be right and you in your hearts know to be right. And let this influence, which is here present, spread throughout the world, inspiring many to live better lives, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Several years ago I visited an isolated oasis deep in the Gobi Desert in China. Some 80 miles from the nearest town, the oasis was in a small canyon that had been occupied by a handful of Buddhist monks for hundreds of years. In this incredibly isolated spot, the monks could avoid the temptations of the world and focus only on Buddhist teachings. In Latter-day Saint terms, these monks were trying to flee Babylon.
Most of us have elected not to dwell in total isolation but to live in the civilized world. This decision requires us to interact daily with the world and to face the challenge of doing business in Babylon even as we attempt to follow the Lord’s command to “go . . . out . . . from Babylon, from the midst of wickedness” (D&amp;C 133:14).
Babylon the Great
In the scriptures the Lord uses the words Babylon and Zion to refer to two archetypes of our temporal existence.1 Babylon represents the world, and Zion represents the pure in heart. But how did Babylon become the name for the archetypal rival to Zion?
The city of Babylon predates Abraham. Located in modern-day southern Iraq, it was a thriving commercial center for more than 17 centuries. At its height it was the capital of a vast empire covering much of the Middle East. In about the fourth century B.C., the splendor and wealth of the city began to fade until, in about the second century A.D., Babylon ceased to exist. By ceased to exist, I mean it disappeared. Only piles of rubble and ruin remained. Until the last century, knowledge of the actual city was preserved only in the Bible and in a few references made by ancient historians.
In its prime, Babylon had two features that were, at different times, counted among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World—the Hanging Gardens and the city’s great exterior walls.2 The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were described as a series of arches arranged in a theater-like manner and ascending to the height of a seven-story building. This construction included 16-foot-long stone beams to bear the weight of the different tiers and a hydraulic system to pump water to the top of the structure, from whence it coursed through the gardens. The stone beams and parts of what scholars believe to be the hydraulic pump system were discovered about 100 years ago.3
The ancient historian Herodotus noted that the walls of Babylon were 335 feet high and 85 feet wide. The walls surrounded an approximately square city with a circumference of about 56 miles, according to Herodotus.4 One could fit BYU, Mapleton, Benjamin, Pleasant Grove, Geneva Steel, and everything in between within the walls described by Herodotus. One could drive two full-sized Hummers side-by-side atop the wall.
Scholars today believe that the Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar was a walled city the size of New York5 with a population of 250,000 or more.6 S</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, my brothers and sisters; it is a great honor and privilege to greet you here this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are met in his name, it is because of him that we are here, and I presume that everything in this life that is really worthwhile comes through the Lord. He has a special program for you and me. It is vitally important that we understand the Lord’s program, for it is calculated to make us happy, which is, of course, the object and design of our existence. “Men are, that they might have joy” (2 Nephi 2:25). That is a collective term—it means woman, too.
We are here upon the earth, you and I, to be happy; but if we are not careful we look for happiness in the wrong places. There are those who think that it has to do with accumulation of material wealth, power, or position—and yet these do not make people happy. Happiness has to do with living in obedience to the Lord’s commandments and being thankful for what one has. It does not make any difference how much one has, for he will not be happy unless he is thankful for it. It is, like wealth, very relative. One man who has hardly anything considers himself wealthy, while another man with many material possessions is not happy because he does not think he has anything. It is all in the mind
The Lord Jesus Christ has taken upon himself the responsibility to save everyone who will ever be born on this earth. That is a great task, and he has done everything godly possible to bring that to pass, even to taking upon himself the sins of everyone who has ever been born or will be born. And he has broken the bands of death, which means that everyone is going to be resurrected. It will not make any difference whether they want to be or not; they are going to be resurrected anyway. There are going to be a lot of these people resurrected that will not want to be but they are going to get it. So you are going to get it whether you want it or not. You do not have to be good; it is a free gift from the Lord Jesus Christ.
In this particular day and time he has given us a program by which we can prepare ourselves for that which is to come, and there are great and momentous occasions ahead of us. In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord outlined, “Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments” (D&amp;C 1:17)—because of the calamities that were coming. Prophets in all ages have known that there were going to be calamities coming in this particular day and time. We need to be aware of the fact that we are living in a time of calamity, and we have to be ready for it. There is a great and dreadful day of the Lord ahead. It always seemed to be a little incongruous to call it “great” and “dreadful” at the same time, but as we think about it, it is very simple: It wi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It’s a great privilege for me to be here this morning. I am always more thrilled when I am in the presence of the young people of the Church because there is such promise among them, and I am very blessed and feel honored to be on this campus.
Summer students, it seems to me, must be rather special. Although tradition is changing, it is rather usual to go to school during fall, winter, and spring. So those who go in hot June, July, and August indicate to me that they are really anxious about an education and are making a serious endeavor. I’m also aware that the great genealogy seminary is being held, and those of you engaged in this betterment of self are among choice people. So I have a great respect for you this morning because I look upon you to be among those who are truly the leaders and anxious to make a contribution to life.
What an exciting, wondrous time to live and to learn and to love. Such a day! There is such an outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord, and it is such a wonderful time to be worthy to enjoy and receive the blessings from him.
When I mentioned to some of the young people of my family (former BYU students) that I was to have this opportunity, they counseled: “Talk about courtship and marriage—that always turns them on.” I suppose that’s a true statement. It seems to me that courtship and marriage turn on the whole world.
I’m not going to talk about courtship and marriage, but what I say could have an effect on your courtship and marriage. And I pray the Lord will help me influence your thoughts and feelings in the way he would have it.
A Spirit of Remembrance
There is a special spirit of reminiscence in this land today. Call it the bicentennial commemoration of the birth of the nation or whatever. But people young and old are concerning themselves with the past and the heritage and the foundation of this nation. History is being reviewed and dramatized and relearned.
The arts of the past are being revived. Lately, old things have become priceless: ten-gallon milk cans, old butter churns, quilts, blacksmith forges. The founding fathers—Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams—are enjoying a popularity. Take for example some of Franklin’s sayings that I’ve heard recently:
He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.
God heals and the doctor takes the fee.
An empty bag cannot stand upright!
We are being brought to a new appreciation of the Lord’s purposes for this nation in that the Constitution of this land was established by wise men raised up for this purpose and this land was redeemed by the shedding of blood.
The Challenge of Establishing Zion
This movement of relating the past to the present and learning again the reasons for the founding of this nation is timely and has purpose. There is more to it than a commemoration. For in this day a living proph</span>
