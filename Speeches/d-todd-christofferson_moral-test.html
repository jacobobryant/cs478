  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="President Samuelson; trustees, faculty, and staff of Brigham Young University; honored guests; parents; family members; and graduates: My dear brothers and sisters, Sister Christofferson and I offer our congratulations, respect, and love to all of you. We thank you for the privilege of being with you on this grand occasion and rejoice with you in the achievements that we honor today. We are pleased to have been authorized to convey to you the greetings of President Thomas S. Monson, his counselors in the First Presidency, and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We extend those greetings and their commendations most warmly.

In preparing my remarks to you, I have determined not to follow the example of my brother, the Apostle Paul, when he spoke to the Saints in Troas. It is reported in the book of Acts that “upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The cartoonist Garry Trudeau is purported to have said, “Commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I’ll do what I can, but I don’t want to over-sedate you.

It is traditional, of course, in graduation speeches to offer counsel. One sage proffered this advice: “Your families are extremely proud of you. You can’t imagine the sense of relief they are experiencing. This would be a most opportune time to ask for money.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Then there are references to the wisdom of the ages. I remember my father’s aphorism repeated often with some exasperation to his five sons: “For every mistake made for not knowing, 10 are made for not looking.” This afternoon, however, I would like to call upon the insights of our departed friend and colleague Professor Hugh Nibley.

We knew Professor Nibley as a man of superior intellect and honest spirituality. I remember my first sighting of him during my freshman year at BYU. It was in the library as I passed a table laden with perhaps two dozen books, most of them open and stacked one upon another in a semicircle in front of an empty chair. As I wondered who could possibly absorb all of that material in one sitting, the legendary scholar appeared out of the stacks carrying three or four more books. I tried not to stare, but it wouldn’t have mattered; Professor Nibley ignored me completely and dove into the books. I was impressed and more than a little motivated. I wish I could tell you that after that experience I never again slumped over a library desk with my face in a book asleep, but dishonesty would be unbecoming in someone in my position.

Hugh Nibley was a graduate student at Berkeley during the Great Depression. He was able to finance his education there with some struggle and a translation job that fortuitously came his way. It is reported that for a time he was extremely discouraged. I quote Boyd Jay Petersen:

&lt;i&gt;When he returned to his family’s home in Hollywood for the Christmas vacation at the end of 1936, his discouragement had become a full-blown depression,&lt;/i&gt; [and he said], &lt;i&gt;“Those were desperate times.” He even began to doubt the truthfulness of the Church. “I thought there were certain flaws in the gospel,” says Hugh. “I was terribly bothered about this afterlife business and that sort of thing. I had no evidence for that whatever.” That all changed when Hugh came down with appendicitis and was taken to the hospital. When the doctor turned the ether on, Hugh swallowed his tongue and stopped breathing. While unconscious, Hugh experienced a life-after-life experience that reoriented his life. “I didn’t meet anything or anybody else, but I looked around, and not only was I in possession of all my faculties, but they were tremendous. I was light as a feather and ready to go.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;This experience had a profound influence on Hugh. Certainly education remained important to him throughout the rest of his life. However, this experience was a “higher” form of education that helped him recognize that the most important tests in this life are not administered in the classroom. This knowledge helped him not take life too seriously,&lt;/i&gt; [and he wrote], &lt;i&gt;“We’re just dabbling around, playing around, being tested for our moral qualities, and above all the two things that we can be good at: we can forgive and we can repent.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

There is no question that it is good to strive to fill our souls with light and truth, described in the scriptures as intelligence.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; I congratulate you again on having been anxiously engaged in seeking learning, “even by study” and I hope “also by faith.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; I trust you will continue to do so, diligently and throughout your life. We understand that

&lt;i&gt;whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Even so, as Professor Nibley observed, in this limited mortal experience “we’re just dabbling around” in our learning. None of us while here will approach the intelligence or glory of God. It behooves us to be humble. We live with an awareness of our divine heritage and destiny, yet not forgetting our present earthly confines.

&lt;i&gt;The Hasidic rabbis taught: “Everyone must have two pockets, so that he can reach into the one or the other according to his need. In his right pocket are the words, ‘For my sake the world was created,’ and in the other, ‘I am&lt;/i&gt; [but] &lt;i&gt;earth and ashes.’”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

In my experience, those who have cultivated their capacities of mind and spirit, who have developed an uncommonly large store of knowledge and wisdom, are typically the most humble of men and women. In diligently applying themselves, they have gained a greater sense of the vast breadth and depth of truth, and they appreciate more than most how small a portion of truth we really know. It is those who know a little as they suppose who oftentimes assume they know a great deal and become guilty of hubris. Indeed, the greatest stumbling block to learning more may be the conviction that we already know nearly everything.

We rightly rejoice in and express gratitude for all that God has revealed in rewarding both spiritual and scientific inquiry, but at the same time we must acknowledge how much more has not been revealed. As God Himself has expressed it:

&lt;i&gt;My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

For those who show themselves capable and desirous, there will be time and opportunity enough now and in the eternities to truly know and understand “things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come.”&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; The real, the core purpose of this mortal experience is the moral test: Will we in fact “do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]”?&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Our central quest is to learn and to live the celestial law: “For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.”&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; If we can learn to abide the celestial law, we become what the scripture calls persons “of a celestial spirit.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; In the Resurrection such persons receive a celestial body, and in due course they receive a fullness of that celestial glory by which they have been quickened&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;—or, in other words, the same fullness of light and truth that constitute the intelligence and glory of God.

Let us suppose that there is a man whose employment it is to come here after today’s ceremonies and stack and store all the folding chairs that some of the graduates and faculty are occupying. Actually, I’m sure there will be a number of people involved—and probably most of them fellow students—but let us suppose that this particular individual is not a graduate of this or any other institution of higher learning because circumstances may have denied him the chance or his interests and skills run in another direction. As a consequence, there are some opportunities that are denied him and potential attainments that are foreclosed to him. It is to me, however, a mark of the justice of God that despite any such limitations, our friend may excel as fully as you and I in the moral test that is at the heart of our mortal experience. There is nothing in what has been denied him that precludes his leaving mortality with feet planted firmly on the path of celestial law that will enable him eventually to attain omniscience. I am reminded of C. S. Lewis’ profound observation, “It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no &lt;i&gt;ordinary&lt;/i&gt; people.”&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

One way to think of the celestial law is Professor Nibley’s simple statement: “The two things that we can be good at: we can forgive and we can repent.” We also have James’ concise and profound expression: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, our test is to learn to serve one another and to attain personal holiness. All the commandments of God tend to one, or usually both of these ends at the same time. BYU professor emeritus Chauncey C. Riddle has observed:

&lt;i&gt;Many people reject&lt;/i&gt; [the celestial law] &lt;i&gt;because it does not allow them to take advantage of other human beings and requires repentance from every sin (which repentance is to stop taking advantage of other human beings and to truly bless them instead). The weakness that prevents and destroys Zion is human selfishness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;

As you look forward to a new phase of life, I urge you to recommit to the celestial law and the Christian standard of greatness:

&lt;i&gt;Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

If it is not already yours, seek for the blessing of marriage and family, where your service can be the most vital, the most unselfish, and the most fulfilling. And if this blessing is denied you until later, serve the children, especially the fatherless, who come within your ambit. And don’t forget those who call you aunt or uncle. Bless all those you can with your wisdom and means. Jesus says to you:

&lt;i&gt;Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore deny yourselves of these, and be not ashamed of me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

John Dryden in his poem &lt;i&gt;The Hind and the Panther&lt;/i&gt; expressed the better nature of mankind that we aspire to develop more fully by repenting, forgiving, and serving:

&lt;i&gt;Beasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where still the stronger on the weaker prey;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Man only of a softer mould is made,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Not for his fellows’ ruin, but their aid:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Created kind, beneficent and free,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The noble image of the Deity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

Today we recognize your very significant achievements. We are happy for you and with you. We place robes on your shoulders and mortar boards, tassels, and other marks of honor upon your head and about your neck. At the same time, my plea to you is not to let this achievement or any other success or failure blind you to your central purpose on earth: to learn to do whatsoever the Lord your God may command. You and I achieved success in the moral test of our premortal first estate. It was a limited but crucial test that opened the way for our current and broader test—one that takes place in a physical body, in a fallen world, and outside God’s personal presence. Whatever time and experiences your particular moral test may entail, success will mean glory (that is, light and truth) “added upon [your] heads for ever and ever.”&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Without diminishing this day, I urge you to keep your eye on the prize. Let your &lt;i&gt;cap and gown&lt;/i&gt; point you to the infinitely greater &lt;i&gt;robe and crown&lt;/i&gt; that await you in God’s celestial realm.

I pray that you will have a full measure of the guidance, protection, and gifts of the Holy Ghost. I pray that day by day and year by year you will draw ever closer to “the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; I affirm my witness of His reality, divinity, and grace and of His desire to walk with you in the moral test that is your life on earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

&lt;i&gt;D. Todd Christofferson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 22 April 2010.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>President Samuelson; trustees, faculty, and staff of Brigham Young University; honored guests; parents; family members; and graduates: My dear brothers and sisters, Sister Christofferson and I offer our congratulations, respect, and love to all of you. We thank you for the privilege of being with you on this grand occasion and rejoice with you in the achievements that we honor today. We are pleased to have been authorized to convey to you the greetings of President Thomas S. Monson, his counselors in the First Presidency, and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We extend those greetings and their commendations most warmly.</p>
<p>In preparing my remarks to you, I have determined not to follow the example of my brother, the Apostle Paul, when he spoke to the Saints in Troas. It is reported in the book of Acts that “upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.”<sup>1</sup> The cartoonist Garry Trudeau is purported to have said, “Commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated.”<sup>2</sup> I’ll do what I can, but I don’t want to over-sedate you.</p>
<p>It is traditional, of course, in graduation speeches to offer counsel. One sage proffered this advice: “Your families are extremely proud of you. You can’t imagine the sense of relief they are experiencing. This would be a most opportune time to ask for money.”<sup>3</sup> Then there are references to the wisdom of the ages. I remember my father’s aphorism repeated often with some exasperation to his five sons: “For every mistake made for not knowing, 10 are made for not looking.” This afternoon, however, I would like to call upon the insights of our departed friend and colleague Professor Hugh Nibley.</p>
<p>We knew Professor Nibley as a man of superior intellect and honest spirituality. I remember my first sighting of him during my freshman year at BYU. It was in the library as I passed a table laden with perhaps two dozen books, most of them open and stacked one upon another in a semicircle in front of an empty chair. As I wondered who could possibly absorb all of that material in one sitting, the legendary scholar appeared out of the stacks carrying three or four more books. I tried not to stare, but it wouldn’t have mattered; Professor Nibley ignored me completely and dove into the books. I was impressed and more than a little motivated. I wish I could tell you that after that experience I never again slumped over a library desk with my face in a book asleep, but dishonesty would be unbecoming in someone in my position.</p>
<p>Hugh Nibley was a graduate student at Berkeley during the Great Depression. He was able to finance his education there with some struggle and a translation job that fortuitously came his way. It is reported that for a time he was extremely discouraged. I quote Boyd Jay Petersen:</p>
<p><i>When he returned to his family’s home in Hollywood for the Christmas vacation at the end of 1936, his discouragement had become a full-blown depression,</i> [and he said], <i>“Those were desperate times.” He even began to doubt the truthfulness of the Church. “I thought there were certain flaws in the gospel,” says Hugh. “I was terribly bothered about this afterlife business and that sort of thing. I had no evidence for that whatever.” That all changed when Hugh came down with appendicitis and was taken to the hospital. When the doctor turned the ether on, Hugh swallowed his tongue and stopped breathing. While unconscious, Hugh experienced a life-after-life experience that reoriented his life. “I didn’t meet anything or anybody else, but I looked around, and not only was I in possession of all my faculties, but they were tremendous. I was light as a feather and ready to go.”</i></p>
<p><i>This experience had a profound influence on Hugh. Certainly education remained important to him throughout the rest of his life. However, this experience was a “higher” form of education that helped him recognize that the most important tests in this life are not administered in the classroom. This knowledge helped him not take life too seriously,</i> [and he wrote], <i>“We’re just dabbling around, playing around, being tested for our moral qualities, and above all the two things that we can be good at: we can forgive and we can repent.”</i><sup>4</sup></p>
<p>There is no question that it is good to strive to fill our souls with light and truth, described in the scriptures as intelligence.<sup>5</sup> I congratulate you again on having been anxiously engaged in seeking learning, “even by study” and I hope “also by faith.”<sup>6</sup> I trust you will continue to do so, diligently and throughout your life. We understand that</p>
<p><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i></p>
<p><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Even so, as Professor Nibley observed, in this limited mortal experience “we’re just dabbling around” in our learning. None of us while here will approach the intelligence or glory of God. It behooves us to be humble. We live with an awareness of our divine heritage and destiny, yet not forgetting our present earthly confines.</p>
<p><i>The Hasidic rabbis taught: “Everyone must have two pockets, so that he can reach into the one or the other according to his need. In his right pocket are the words, ‘For my sake the world was created,’ and in the other, ‘I am</i> [but] <i>earth and ashes.’”</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>In my experience, those who have cultivated their capacities of mind and spirit, who have developed an uncommonly large store of knowledge and wisdom, are typically the most humble of men and women. In diligently applying themselves, they have gained a greater sense of the vast breadth and depth of truth, and they appreciate more than most how small a portion of truth we really know. It is those who know a little as they suppose who oftentimes assume they know a great deal and become guilty of hubris. Indeed, the greatest stumbling block to learning more may be the conviction that we already know nearly everything.</p>
<p>We rightly rejoice in and express gratitude for all that God has revealed in rewarding both spiritual and scientific inquiry, but at the same time we must acknowledge how much more has not been revealed. As God Himself has expressed it:</p>
<p><i>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>For those who show themselves capable and desirous, there will be time and opportunity enough now and in the eternities to truly know and understand “things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come.”<sup>10</sup> The real, the core purpose of this mortal experience is the moral test: Will we in fact “do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]”?<sup>11</sup> Our central quest is to learn and to live the celestial law: “For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.”<sup>12</sup> If we can learn to abide the celestial law, we become what the scripture calls persons “of a celestial spirit.”<sup>13</sup> In the Resurrection such persons receive a celestial body, and in due course they receive a fullness of that celestial glory by which they have been quickened<sup>14</sup>—or, in other words, the same fullness of light and truth that constitute the intelligence and glory of God.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that there is a man whose employment it is to come here after today’s ceremonies and stack and store all the folding chairs that some of the graduates and faculty are occupying. Actually, I’m sure there will be a number of people involved—and probably most of them fellow students—but let us suppose that this particular individual is not a graduate of this or any other institution of higher learning because circumstances may have denied him the chance or his interests and skills run in another direction. As a consequence, there are some opportunities that are denied him and potential attainments that are foreclosed to him. It is to me, however, a mark of the justice of God that despite any such limitations, our friend may excel as fully as you and I in the moral test that is at the heart of our mortal experience. There is nothing in what has been denied him that precludes his leaving mortality with feet planted firmly on the path of celestial law that will enable him eventually to attain omniscience. I am reminded of C. S. Lewis’ profound observation, “It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no <i>ordinary</i> people.”<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>One way to think of the celestial law is Professor Nibley’s simple statement: “The two things that we can be good at: we can forgive and we can repent.” We also have James’ concise and profound expression: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”<sup>16</sup> In other words, our test is to learn to serve one another and to attain personal holiness. All the commandments of God tend to one, or usually both of these ends at the same time. BYU professor emeritus Chauncey C. Riddle has observed:</p>
<p><i>Many people reject</i> [the celestial law] <i>because it does not allow them to take advantage of other human beings and requires repentance from every sin (which repentance is to stop taking advantage of other human beings and to truly bless them instead). The weakness that prevents and destroys Zion is human selfishness.</i><sup>17</sup></p>
<p>As you look forward to a new phase of life, I urge you to recommit to the celestial law and the Christian standard of greatness:</p>
<p><i>Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</i></p>
<p><i>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</i><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>If it is not already yours, seek for the blessing of marriage and family, where your service can be the most vital, the most unselfish, and the most fulfilling. And if this blessing is denied you until later, serve the children, especially the fatherless, who come within your ambit. And don’t forget those who call you aunt or uncle. Bless all those you can with your wisdom and means. Jesus says to you:</p>
<p><i>Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</i></p>
<p><i>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? . . .</i><sup>19</sup></p>
<p><i>Therefore deny yourselves of these, and be not ashamed of me.</i><sup>20</sup></p>
<p>John Dryden in his poem <i>The Hind and the Panther</i> expressed the better nature of mankind that we aspire to develop more fully by repenting, forgiving, and serving:</p>
<p><i>Beasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway,</i><br />
<i>Where still the stronger on the weaker prey;</i><br />
<i>Man only of a softer mould is made,</i><br />
<i>Not for his fellows’ ruin, but their aid:</i><br />
<i>Created kind, beneficent and free,</i><br />
<i>The noble image of the Deity.</i><sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Today we recognize your very significant achievements. We are happy for you and with you. We place robes on your shoulders and mortar boards, tassels, and other marks of honor upon your head and about your neck. At the same time, my plea to you is not to let this achievement or any other success or failure blind you to your central purpose on earth: to learn to do whatsoever the Lord your God may command. You and I achieved success in the moral test of our premortal first estate. It was a limited but crucial test that opened the way for our current and broader test—one that takes place in a physical body, in a fallen world, and outside God’s personal presence. Whatever time and experiences your particular moral test may entail, success will mean glory (that is, light and truth) “added upon [your] heads for ever and ever.”<sup>22</sup> Without diminishing this day, I urge you to keep your eye on the prize. Let your <i>cap and gown</i> point you to the infinitely greater <i>robe and crown</i> that await you in God’s celestial realm.</p>
<p>I pray that you will have a full measure of the guidance, protection, and gifts of the Holy Ghost. I pray that day by day and year by year you will draw ever closer to “the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”<sup>23</sup> I affirm my witness of His reality, divinity, and grace and of His desire to walk with you in the moral test that is your life on earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I join Peggy in welcoming you to the new school year. For some of you, including an unprecedented number of returned missionaries, this will be your first semester as full-time students at BYU. Others are back for another round. For all, it is a wonderful time of new opportunities, challenges, and, we hope, optimism. As Peggy mentioned, the women’s volleyball and soccer teams are both ranked nationally. The men’s and women’s cross-­country teams both won their first meets. And this past weekend the football team demonstrated that Book of Mormon scriptures apply to our times. Read Moroni 7:29 before you watch the replay of that last play.
Peggy next mentioned Laman and Lemuel in her talk. Several years ago, while reading the Book of Mormon, it dawned on me that I had probably been too hard on Laman and Lemuel. Or, more accurately, I realized, to my chagrin, that at times I had been more like them than I cared to admit. While we tend to think of Laman and Lemuel as disobedient rebels who never did anything right, the narrative from their perspective would probably have been much different. My guess is that for much of their lives, Laman and Lemuel considered themselves active members of the Church, doing the things that they were asked to do, even the hard things.
Think about it. When their father asked them to leave behind their riches, abandon their friends, and go out into the wilderness, did they go? Yes.1
When their father asked them to return to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban—not an easy task—did they go? Yes.2
When their father asked them to return again to get Ishmael and his family, they complied.3
When their brother asked them to help build a boat, even though he had no prior experience in such an endeavor, did they help? Eventually.4
And when they were instructed to get on that boat—to trust their lives and those of their families to a craft that had not only not been tested for seaworthiness but had also not been built in the normal manner—were they willing to trust their leaders and follow their instruction? Absolutely.5
Given this outward obedience, in my mind’s eye I can see Laman and Lemuel responding to their father’s repeated entreaties to be obedient by saying, “We have done everything you have asked us to do. What more do you want?”
What Lehi wanted from his sons, and what God wants from us, is not just outward physical compliance but also inward spiritual commitment. He wants not just our acts but our hearts, minds, and souls. And if we don’t give those to Him, eventually things will go wrong, as the experiences of Laman and Lemuel demonstrate.
In one sense, what separated Laman and Lemuel from Nephi was not so much their outward actions—although at critical times there were significant and telling differences in their actions, as Peggy has pointed out—but ra</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear young brothers and sisters, Kristen and I feel privileged to be with you on this significant occasion. We meet on 9/11, the tenth anniversary of an event that has profoundly influenced our lives and thinking and will do so for many years to come. It is forever associated with the Twin Towers.
I have felt impressed to speak this evening about another set of twins, the twin ideas of Truth and Tolerance. These subjects were not chosen because they are uniquely your concern as young adults, like the dating, hanging out, and marriage I described to this audience some years ago. My treatment of truth and tolerance will invite you to consider and to teach these twin subjects because they are vital to the rising generation, in which you are the senior members.
We Believe in Absolute Truth
First: Truth. We believe in absolute truth, including the existence of God and the right and wrong established by His commandments. We sing:
Tho the heavens depart and the earth’s fountains burst,Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,Eternal, unchanged, evermore.1
In the words of President Joseph F. Smith:
We believe in all truth, no matter to what subject it may refer. No sect or religious denomination in the world possesses a single principle of truth that we do not accept or that we will reject. We are willing to receive all truth, from whatever source it may come; for truth will stand, truth will endure.2
The existence and nature of truth is one of the fundamental questions of mortal life. Jesus told the Roman governor Pilate that He came into the world to “bear witness unto the truth.”
“What is truth?” that unbeliever responded. (See John 18:37–38.)
In earlier times the Savior had declared, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). In modern revelation He declared: “Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come” (D&amp;C 93:24).
My young brothers and sisters, we know that the existence of God and the existence of absolute truth are fundamental to life on this earth, whether they are believed or not. We also know that evil exists and that some things are simply, seriously, and everlastingly wrong. You whom I address shun evil and seek truth. I salute you for your righteous actions and your righteous desires. As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, I seek to help you make right choices in a world that is increasingly polarized between belief and disbelief, between good and evil.
Shocking reports of large-scale thievery and lying in civilized societies in the last two months suggest a moral vacuum in which many have little sense of right and wrong. Last month’s widespread rioting and pillaging in Britain and the scandalous, widespread cheating by teachers on state-mandated tests in elementary and middle schools in Atlanta, Georgia, have ca</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I offer you a warm greeting on this cold January day. Two years ago, in January, President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke to the leaders of the Church around the world, both men and women. Commenting on current conditions, he said:
No one need tell you that we are living in a very difficult season in the history of the world. . . .
. . . I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah. At that season, Abraham bargained with the Lord to save these cities for the sake of the righteous. Notwithstanding his pleas, things were so bad that Jehovah decreed their destruction. They and their wicked inhabitants were annihilated. We see similar conditions today. They prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters.
In the Church we are working very hard to stem the tide of this evil. But it is an uphill battle, and we sometimes wonder whether we are making any headway. But we are succeeding in a substantial way. We see so many of our youth who are faithful and true and who look to us for encouragement and direction.1
It was you President Hinckley thought of when he looked for signs that we might be succeeding as a Church in stemming the tide of evil. If, as he said, you look to us for encouragement and direction, I want to offer you some of each. I would like to talk to you about moral agency and offer some counsel about how you use your agency.
In years past, we generally used the term free agency. That is not incorrect, but more recently we have taken note that free agency does not appear as an expression in the scriptures. They talk of our being “free to choose” and “free to act” for ourselves2 and of our obligation to do many things of our own “free will.”3 But the word agency appears either by itself or, in Doctrine and Covenants, section 101, verse 78, with the modifier moral: “That every man may act in doctrine and principle . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment” (emphasis added). When we use the term moral agency, then, we are appropriately emphasizing the accountability that is an essential part of the divine gift of agency. We are moral beings and agents unto ourselves, free to choose but also responsible for our choices.
The Elements of Moral Agency
What, then, are the elements of moral agency? To me there are three.
First, there must be alternatives to choose among. Lehi described it as opposites, or “opposition.”4 He spoke of righteousness and its opposite, wickedness; holiness versus misery; good versus bad.5 Without opposites, Lehi said, “All things must needs be a compound in one; . . . no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, h</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Your Turn
Imagine with me a scene from the premortal existence. The time is about two decades ago, plus or minus a few years. We see an eager spirit at the front window watching the mailbox located out by the street. The mailman arrives and a delivery is made. The spirit rushes out to the mailbox with great anticipation that a long-awaited letter has been delivered.
Plowing through the usual junk mail and monthly statements, we see a large white envelope. This may be it! Eagerly the letter is opened. Your name and address heads the letter. You read on: “Greetings! Your application to the ‘University of Mortality’ has been accepted.”
The letter goes on to give you instructions on the date your first semester will begin and the names of your new dorm parents. There’s a catalog attached detailing information and opportunities available to you in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. The long wait is over!
With anticipation you have looked forward to this day. Your remember the time of the Grand Council in Heaven when you elected to be tested as a mortal. You have watched through the centuries, and now the Lord’s instructions to his prophets ring in your ears.
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? [Job 38:4–7]
Now is your time to shout for joy, for now it is your turn to be on earth!
Three Degrees
Preparation for your birth date finds you studying the catalog over and over again. If you are accepted for graduation from the University of Mortality, it will be possible for you to receive one of three degrees—a telestial degree, terrestrial degree, or a celestial degree. The choice will be yours as to which one you will prepare yourself to obtain. The opportunities in the eternities to come depend on which degree you decide to strive for.
As you study the options, only the celestial degree offers eternal growth and opportunity and life with Father again. We read:
These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical.
And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fullness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament.
And again, we saw the glory of the telestial, which glory is that of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differ from that of the glory of the </span>
