  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="President Harvey L. Taylor, faculty, and ­students—all of you being my brothers and sisters—I am grateful for the privilege of standing today in this great fieldhouse at your devotional assembly. I bring you nothing startling. I merely came to chat with the students for a little while this morning during this devotional hour.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Time for Decision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
You are living in a wonderful age; you are living in the wonderful time of your lives. I often think of our lives as being like the sun crossing the sky. The period around dawn represents the time of birth and childhood. You live in that part of the day when the sun has just broken over the tops of the mountains and is giving you light and warmth in the early part of your life’s day. The whole day lies ahead of you, and to make it worthwhile takes planning and thought. I believe you are at that point in life when you are giving thought and planning to the remainder of the day that lies ahead.

As children, you were cared for and all things were done for you. Then the teenage years followed the period of youth, and now you are at the wonderful time in life in which you find yourselves as university students.

You are on the threshold of life itself, and the path ahead is becoming visible to most of you. It is during this period of life that the path commences to take shape, and since we can see its outline, we have a little better understanding of where we are going and what we are going to do. This is the time for decision.

Success requires a lot of careful planning, and you are here to form these plans and to make decisions to carry you forward in life. You have selected BYU as your university because of what it has to offer and what it can do for you in academic work and also in preparation for the spiritual side of life. I hope you have caught the vision of the spiritual side of your education as you have entered through these portals and have studied here. I am sure you fully realize the value of education as well as the value of the spiritual life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giving Brings the Greatest Happiness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Let us look backward for just a moment to our childhood and analyze that which gave us the greatest happiness when we were children. I am inclined to believe that the things that we enjoyed most and that gave us the greatest happiness when we were children were the things that were given to us. When our parents went away and returned, we always looked for some little token that they would bring back to us. We looked forward to Christmas because of the things we were going to receive. Our whole life was built around receiving. At that time we did not understand the other side of giving.

Sometime during our progress through this life we came to that point when we suddenly realized that it is not receiving that brings us happiness. To some this comes early in life, to others it comes later—and I am inclined to believe that there are some who never have this awakening during the daytime of their lives. They miss one of the great principles that brings happiness to us.

When the time comes that we learn to share and do things for other people, life takes on a new vision for us. This has come to the lives of most of you. To some it comes when a young man goes on a mission and he suddenly discovers that he is giving of himself, his time, his energy, and his means for the benefit of others. To some this awakening comes at marriage. Suddenly one discovers that happiness does not come from receiving but from that which one gives to another.

I am always impressed by the teachings of the Savior. He taught in simple, homely language. He said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). This realization, of course, comes to us with maturity. It is the understanding of this lesson in life that brings about maturity; it changes our childhood ideas to the ideas and the ideals of adults.

Giving does not always consist of material things. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In this sense we have unlimited resources.

I realize that I am speaking today to persons of limited resources as far as material things are concerned, and it is no disgrace for a student to be poverty stricken. As I view you, I look above material value and see in you the possibility of greatness as you give of yourself. I see young men preparing for missions. I see young men and young women preparing for marriage. I see students qualifying themselves to serve their fellowmen in business, in industry, and in the communities and in society wherever they may go after leaving this institution. I see many of you preparing for Church service and all of you preparing to serve God throughout your lives. I think these are the great values.

It is little acts of giving as we go along that brighten our lives.

&lt;i&gt;Thomas Dreier tells the story of a man over eighty who was observed by a neighbor planting a small peach tree.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“Do you expect to eat peaches from that tree?” the neighbor asked.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The old gentleman rested on his spade. “No,” he said. “At my age I know I won’t. But all my life I’ve enjoyed peaches—never from a tree I had planted myself. I wouldn’t have had peaches if other men hadn’t done what I’m doing now. I’m just trying to pay the other fellows who planted peach trees for me.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Gifts That Money Cannot Buy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The gifts that money cannot buy are those that bring happiness to us in life. These are the gifts we pass on to others from the attributes we acquire as we go through life.

First is the attribute of thoughtfulness to others.

Second, its close cousin, is consideration for others.

Third, we must have courage—courage to do the right thing always.

Fourth, those who have a good nature enjoy life. A pleasant smile begets smiles, smiles beget friends, and friends are better than fortunes.

Fifth is the attribute of tolerance. I think of an old Indian prayer: “Great Spirit, help me never to judge another until I have walked two weeks in his moccasins.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Sixth, we must have appreciation for those things that come to us or we never find happiness.

Seventh, we enjoy life when we have the ­ability to praise others for their good works. George Matthew Adams said, “He who praises another enriches himself far more than he does the one praised. To praise is an investment in happiness.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; He also said, “The poorest human being often has something to give that the ­richest could not buy.”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

David Dunn told the story of a man walking down the sidewalk past a little girl sitting on the doorstep of a house looking very dejected. He said to her, “That’s a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; pretty red dress you are wearing, young lady.”

She looked up at him and smiled and said, “Oh, thank you,” and her face lit up at this compliment. Later, when he passed her house again, she brightly said, “Hello—Man!”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

He had found a friend. It is easy to find friends as we pass this way if we acquire the attributes that attract friends. Friends are some of our most priceless possessions. Robert Louis Stevenson is attributed as saying, “A friend is a present you give yourself.”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Eighth, to find happiness we must help others as we go through life. Elihu Root, U.S. secretary of state from 1905 to 1909, wrote:

&lt;i&gt;I observe that there are two entirely different ­theories according to which individual men seek to get on in the world. One theory leads a man to pull down everybody around him in order to climb up on them to a higher place. The other leads a man to help everybody around him in order that he may go up with them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

If we rise to success in life, it is because we have lifted others up with us. I like to think of success as a journey, not as a destination. Happiness is found along the way of this journey, not at the end of the road. The time for happiness is today, not tomorrow. The following was written more than a century ago:

&lt;i&gt;I expect to pass through this world but once; any good thing therefore that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now; let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

We are wise when we follow good examples in life. We should pattern our lives after the examples of those who have been successful in the important things of life. We must distinguish between the things that are important and those that are not.

I have had the pleasure of sitting as a member of the board of trustees of Brigham Young University with great men—men of importance, men whom you admire—under President David O. McKay as chairman of that board. When I think of the leadership of this university, its presidency, and its faculty, I am impressed and thrilled by the advantage you have as students in this great institution. Nowhere in the world can a comparable situation be found, for there is no other.

I am sure you all realize that the trustees, the presidency, and the faculty have an interest in you as students in this school. Every tithepayer in the Church extends to you a helping hand, for you know that the amount you pay does not cover all the costs of your education. This is the spirit of giving. Those who have gone this way before are willing to extend a helping hand to you, knowing that you will appreciate this and that the time will come when you will have the opportunity to reach back with your extended hand to help others come this way. And so we share with each other, we encourage each other, and we find happiness by giving and not by receiving.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Gift of Appreciation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass, as&lt;/i&gt; [Jesus] &lt;i&gt;went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?&lt;/i&gt; [Luke 17:11–17]

Appreciation is one of the great attributes that brings us happiness as we travel this way, yet of the ten who were healed, only one expressed appreciation. Are we among the nine?

I had a sad errand to perform one day as I went with a mission president to tell an elder in the field of the passing of his father. He met us at the door to tell us how thrilled he was with the work of that day and what had been accomplished. Then we asked him to sit down for a moment, and we delivered the message. I shall never forget the experience.

He said, “I have learned a lot of things since I have been out in the field and have had time to think them through. I wish I could have talked to my father one more time because I had so many things to tell him.”

This is true of most of us in life. The letter we did not write, the word of appreciation we intended to express but did not take the time to do so—there are so many little things we could have done to brighten our lives and to brighten the lives of others. These are the lessons we do not learn until we cross over the threshold in life in which we find that the words of Jesus are so true: “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lesson of Giving&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
When we learn this lesson of giving, we are on the high road. Our lives change, our attitudes change, maturity develops, and we are ready to face life. If each day we could be kind and courteous and thoughtful, our circle of friends would increase. If we could forget the grumbling and all the other things that are negative, how bright our lives would become. We can do it if we will merely follow the counsel of the Savior, think of Him and His life, and lift ourselves by living close to the Spirit and that inspiration. He will bless us, walk with us, and extend His hand to us, and life will become what we would like it to be—high, noble, and elevated.

May the Lord bless you as students to learn the value of gifts that money cannot buy and the lesson of this great university, I humbly pray in Jesus’ name, amen.

			<p>President Harvey L. Taylor, faculty, and ­students—all of you being my brothers and sisters—I am grateful for the privilege of standing today in this great fieldhouse at your devotional assembly. I bring you nothing startling. I merely came to chat with the students for a little while this morning during this devotional hour.</p>
<h2><b>The Time for Decision</b></h2>
<p>You are living in a wonderful age; you are living in the wonderful time of your lives. I often think of our lives as being like the sun crossing the sky. The period around dawn represents the time of birth and childhood. You live in that part of the day when the sun has just broken over the tops of the mountains and is giving you light and warmth in the early part of your life’s day. The whole day lies ahead of you, and to make it worthwhile takes planning and thought. I believe you are at that point in life when you are giving thought and planning to the remainder of the day that lies ahead.</p>
<p>As children, you were cared for and all things were done for you. Then the teenage years followed the period of youth, and now you are at the wonderful time in life in which you find yourselves as university students.</p>
<p>You are on the threshold of life itself, and the path ahead is becoming visible to most of you. It is during this period of life that the path commences to take shape, and since we can see its outline, we have a little better understanding of where we are going and what we are going to do. This is the time for decision.</p>
<p>Success requires a lot of careful planning, and you are here to form these plans and to make decisions to carry you forward in life. You have selected BYU as your university because of what it has to offer and what it can do for you in academic work and also in preparation for the spiritual side of life. I hope you have caught the vision of the spiritual side of your education as you have entered through these portals and have studied here. I am sure you fully realize the value of education as well as the value of the spiritual life.</p>
<h2><b>Giving Brings the Greatest Happiness</b></h2>
<p>Let us look backward for just a moment to our childhood and analyze that which gave us the greatest happiness when we were children. I am inclined to believe that the things that we enjoyed most and that gave us the greatest happiness when we were children were the things that were given to us. When our parents went away and returned, we always looked for some little token that they would bring back to us. We looked forward to Christmas because of the things we were going to receive. Our whole life was built around receiving. At that time we did not understand the other side of giving.</p>
<p>Sometime during our progress through this life we came to that point when we suddenly realized that it is not receiving that brings us happiness. To some this comes early in life, to others it comes later—and I am inclined to believe that there are some who never have this awakening during the daytime of their lives. They miss one of the great principles that brings happiness to us.</p>
<p>When the time comes that we learn to share and do things for other people, life takes on a new vision for us. This has come to the lives of most of you. To some it comes when a young man goes on a mission and he suddenly discovers that he is giving of himself, his time, his energy, and his means for the benefit of others. To some this awakening comes at marriage. Suddenly one discovers that happiness does not come from receiving but from that which one gives to another.</p>
<p>I am always impressed by the teachings of the Savior. He taught in simple, homely language. He said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). This realization, of course, comes to us with maturity. It is the understanding of this lesson in life that brings about maturity; it changes our childhood ideas to the ideas and the ideals of adults.</p>
<p>Giving does not always consist of material things. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself.”<sup>1</sup> In this sense we have unlimited resources.</p>
<p>I realize that I am speaking today to persons of limited resources as far as material things are concerned, and it is no disgrace for a student to be poverty stricken. As I view you, I look above material value and see in you the possibility of greatness as you give of yourself. I see young men preparing for missions. I see young men and young women preparing for marriage. I see students qualifying themselves to serve their fellowmen in business, in industry, and in the communities and in society wherever they may go after leaving this institution. I see many of you preparing for Church service and all of you preparing to serve God throughout your lives. I think these are the great values.</p>
<p>It is little acts of giving as we go along that brighten our lives.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Dreier tells the story of a man over eighty who was observed by a neighbor planting a small peach tree.</i></p>
<p><i>“Do you expect to eat peaches from that tree?” the neighbor asked.</i></p>
<p><i>The old gentleman rested on his spade. “No,” he said. “At my age I know I won’t. But all my life I’ve enjoyed peaches—never from a tree I had planted myself. I wouldn’t have had peaches if other men hadn’t done what I’m doing now. I’m just trying to pay the other fellows who planted peach trees for me.”</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<h2><b>The Gifts That Money Cannot Buy</b></h2>
<p>The gifts that money cannot buy are those that bring happiness to us in life. These are the gifts we pass on to others from the attributes we acquire as we go through life.</p>
<p>First is the attribute of thoughtfulness to others.</p>
<p>Second, its close cousin, is consideration for others.</p>
<p>Third, we must have courage—courage to do the right thing always.</p>
<p>Fourth, those who have a good nature enjoy life. A pleasant smile begets smiles, smiles beget friends, and friends are better than fortunes.</p>
<p>Fifth is the attribute of tolerance. I think of an old Indian prayer: “Great Spirit, help me never to judge another until I have walked two weeks in his moccasins.”<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Sixth, we must have appreciation for those things that come to us or we never find happiness.</p>
<p>Seventh, we enjoy life when we have the ­ability to praise others for their good works. George Matthew Adams said, “He who praises another enriches himself far more than he does the one praised. To praise is an investment in happiness.”<sup>4</sup> He also said, “The poorest human being often has something to give that the ­richest could not buy.”<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>David Dunn told the story of a man walking down the sidewalk past a little girl sitting on the doorstep of a house looking very dejected. He said to her, “That’s a <i>very</i> pretty red dress you are wearing, young lady.”</p>
<p>She looked up at him and smiled and said, “Oh, thank you,” and her face lit up at this compliment. Later, when he passed her house again, she brightly said, “Hello—Man!”<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>He had found a friend. It is easy to find friends as we pass this way if we acquire the attributes that attract friends. Friends are some of our most priceless possessions. Robert Louis Stevenson is attributed as saying, “A friend is a present you give yourself.”<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Eighth, to find happiness we must help others as we go through life. Elihu Root, U.S. secretary of state from 1905 to 1909, wrote:</p>
<p><i>I observe that there are two entirely different ­theories according to which individual men seek to get on in the world. One theory leads a man to pull down everybody around him in order to climb up on them to a higher place. The other leads a man to help everybody around him in order that he may go up with them.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>If we rise to success in life, it is because we have lifted others up with us. I like to think of success as a journey, not as a destination. Happiness is found along the way of this journey, not at the end of the road. The time for happiness is today, not tomorrow. The following was written more than a century ago:</p>
<p><i>I expect to pass through this world but once; any good thing therefore that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now; let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>We are wise when we follow good examples in life. We should pattern our lives after the examples of those who have been successful in the important things of life. We must distinguish between the things that are important and those that are not.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of sitting as a member of the board of trustees of Brigham Young University with great men—men of importance, men whom you admire—under President David O. McKay as chairman of that board. When I think of the leadership of this university, its presidency, and its faculty, I am impressed and thrilled by the advantage you have as students in this great institution. Nowhere in the world can a comparable situation be found, for there is no other.</p>
<p>I am sure you all realize that the trustees, the presidency, and the faculty have an interest in you as students in this school. Every tithepayer in the Church extends to you a helping hand, for you know that the amount you pay does not cover all the costs of your education. This is the spirit of giving. Those who have gone this way before are willing to extend a helping hand to you, knowing that you will appreciate this and that the time will come when you will have the opportunity to reach back with your extended hand to help others come this way. And so we share with each other, we encourage each other, and we find happiness by giving and not by receiving.</p>
<h2><b>The Gift of Appreciation</b></h2>
<p><i>And it came to pass, as</i> [Jesus] <i>went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</i></p>
<p><i>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</i></p>
<p><i>And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</i></p>
<p><i>And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</i></p>
<p><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i></p>
<p><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i></p>
<p><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i> [Luke 17:11–17]</p>
<p>Appreciation is one of the great attributes that brings us happiness as we travel this way, yet of the ten who were healed, only one expressed appreciation. Are we among the nine?</p>
<p>I had a sad errand to perform one day as I went with a mission president to tell an elder in the field of the passing of his father. He met us at the door to tell us how thrilled he was with the work of that day and what had been accomplished. Then we asked him to sit down for a moment, and we delivered the message. I shall never forget the experience.</p>
<p>He said, “I have learned a lot of things since I have been out in the field and have had time to think them through. I wish I could have talked to my father one more time because I had so many things to tell him.”</p>
<p>This is true of most of us in life. The letter we did not write, the word of appreciation we intended to express but did not take the time to do so—there are so many little things we could have done to brighten our lives and to brighten the lives of others. These are the lessons we do not learn until we cross over the threshold in life in which we find that the words of Jesus are so true: “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”</p>
<h2><b>The Lesson of Giving</b></h2>
<p>When we learn this lesson of giving, we are on the high road. Our lives change, our attitudes change, maturity develops, and we are ready to face life. If each day we could be kind and courteous and thoughtful, our circle of friends would increase. If we could forget the grumbling and all the other things that are negative, how bright our lives would become. We can do it if we will merely follow the counsel of the Savior, think of Him and His life, and lift ourselves by living close to the Spirit and that inspiration. He will bless us, walk with us, and extend His hand to us, and life will become what we would like it to be—high, noble, and elevated.</p>
<p>May the Lord bless you as students to learn the value of gifts that money cannot buy and the lesson of this great university, I humbly pray in Jesus’ name, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It’s an honor for me to be here at Brigham Young University, and it’s a delight for me to be here in beautiful Provo. The last time I was here was in the fall of 2007. I have happy memories of my last visit, and I have great anticipation of my next. I’m always delighted to be here, and I can see why statistics show that Utahns are some of the happiest people in the United States. It’s quite clear, just by looking around, why that would be so.
I’m going to talk to you today about something that you’ve probably given a lot of thought to: charity. But I want to talk about it in a way you maybe haven’t thought about it: about how you can use it in your lives and in the lives of others. I want to talk to you about how charity can and should prominently figure in the lives of Christian people—but in a way that maybe hasn’t quite occurred to you before. I want to start with a quote from the famous industrialist John D. Rockefeller from 1905.
Rockefeller was famously quoted in that year as saying, “God gave me my money” (in Reo Bennett, “How the Richest Man in the World Observes Christmas,” Woman’s Home Companion, December 1905, 14). Now, that’s sort of troubling to Christian people. God gave him his money? Some have used the quote as evidence that John D. Rockefeller was a bad man—that he believed he deserved to be rich when other people were poor. But that’s not actually what he meant.
In 1906 Rockefeller went on to tell a newspaper reporter for the New York American: “I believe the power to make money is a gift from God . . . to be developed and used to the best of our ability for the good of mankind” (to William Hoster, quoted in Jules Abels, The Rockefeller Billions: The Story of the World’s Most Stupendous Fortune [New York: Macmillan, 1965], 279–80).
What Rockefeller meant was this: He believed that he made money because he was charged with helping others with his money, and he honestly believed (as he wrote at other times) that if he stopped giving his money and giving it in the right way, then God would take his money away.
Now, that still might trouble you theologically that God would intervene in the direct finances of John D. Rockefeller, but you have to admit that it doesn’t sound so weird at that point. John D. Rockefeller believed that he was rich because he gave so much, and throughout his life, before he was a rich man, he gave a lot. He was a charitable person.
A lot of entrepreneurs believe that one of the reasons that they’re rich is because they give. Entrepreneurs in this country are some of its most charitable citizens. And I’ve always heard this, because for years I taught in a department of entrepreneurship, so I got to know the modern John D. Rockefellers who thought that they were rich partly because they gave. But, you know, I never believed it—never believed a word of it—because I was trained </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, you have done it again. This is the 10th year that you have done so, and I congratulate you most warmly. I speak of the Princeton Review rankings, where you have come in first out of 366 colleges. You are the most “stone-cold sober” student body in America.
How proud you ought to feel about this designation—no smoking, no drinking, no drugs. You are living up to the Honor Code of this institution. You will be blessed for doing so.
Why would anyone on this campus, where education is heavily subsidized by the Church, have any desire to do anything less?
It is a remarkable thing that on any given Sunday this magnificent physical plant becomes a vast Church campus. Thousands of young people, scriptures in hand, are to be seen hurrying to classrooms and lecture halls that become places of religious instruction. I do not know where else in all this world there is a similar thing of such magnitude.
Now, yesterday’s Wall Street Journal published the rankings of university business schools, and BYU came in number one in the regional rankings among all the business schools of America (see “Recruiters’ Top Schools,” Journal Report on Business Schools: The Recruiters’ Picks [special section], Wall Street Journal, 17 September 2007, R5).
What a unique institution this is. Coupled with its associates in Hawaii and Idaho, it is a leader both academically and spiritually. How fortunate you are in the opportunity to attend here. Many others wish to come here but are unable to do so.
The magnificent physical plant, together with a great faculty, makes it an academic jewel. But the end product of all of this, of course, is you—you thousands of aspiring young scholars.
I agree that it is a grinding experience to earn a degree here. But the result is something of which you can be extremely proud.
The by-product of your academic achievement will be a bundle of ethical, moral, and spiritual values. These are summarized in our thirteenth article of faith: “We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men” (Articles of Faith 1:13).
This is a short and simple statement, but its implications are enormous.
We believe in being honest.
We cannot cheat. We cannot do anything of a dishonest nature. We make a pledge with ourselves to be scrupulously honest in all that we do. This is not always easy.
In matters of honesty, there are no shortcuts—no little white lies or big black lies. There is only the simple, honest truth spoken in total candor. And I think there is nothing more honest than good, hard work.
I recently read a book titled No Shortcuts to the Top. It is the story of Ed Viesturs. Ed has climbed Mount Everest six times and has reached the summits of the world’s highest mountains without the use of supplemental oxygen. When asked how he did it, h</span>
