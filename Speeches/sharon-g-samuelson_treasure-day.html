  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Today is January 8, 2008, and the beginning of a new semester at Brigham Young University. I always look forward to the start of a new year with great anticipation, wondering what the days will bring as the year unfolds. I do know that this beautiful campus will be filled with the excitement and activity that always occur when you are here. Each day can provide experiences that can make your time at BYU the means to achieving your goals and the righteous desires of your hearts.

Each of you has taken a different pathway that has resulted in your attending Brigham Young University. You have come from all over the world and represent many different nations and cultures. For some of you, it is your first time at BYU. For others, this semester is a continuation of your schooling at this institution. I believe that the Lord has, in His loving and caring way, opened the door for you to enter this university. The Lord has told you that He will open doors to bless your lives if you remember Him. In Revelation 3:8 we read, "Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."

It is now your opportunity to immerse yourself in the BYU experience and take advantage of all that is available for you in learning things spiritual and temporal, serving and caring, and enhancing your testimonies of the teachings of the Savior, whose birth we have just celebrated. The Lord has stated that He will continue to open doors for you if you remember Him and keep His commandments.

Brigham Young once said, "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the worlds work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University," &lt;i&gt;Improvement Era,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920], 831). I especially am drawn to the last part of his definition: "the power to appreciate life."

When my husband and I were first married, he was an undergraduate student with a goal of attending medical school, and I was teaching sixth grade. His classes, part-time work, and studies obviously took most of his time. My obligations with work and spending evenings doing all that was necessary to fulfill my teaching responsibilities also took many hours to complete. Once we included our Church callings, we didnt have much time together during the week. I found that I was always looking forward to Friday evenings, when not only would things become more relaxed but we could have some time together as well as a little social life during the weekends. I always seemed to have the "thank goodness its Friday" mentality. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays I was always looking forward to the weekends; thus I was not really enjoying the weekdays. I was happy on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays and a little depressed on the weekdays.

However, one day something occurred that caused me to see this negative outlook in a new light. I cant recall what caused this change in my attitude, but I was struck with the thought that by wanting the weekdays to pass by quickly and always looking forward to the weekends, I was wishing a very important part of my life away. I realized that my time &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; was valuable and I should appreciate every day - not wish it away! After all, I didnt know how many Mondays through Fridays I had in my future. Time passes quickly enough, and, because I wanted it to do so, I did not take full advantage of some valuable opportunities and experiences that were available to me.

Concerning the days of your lives, Ralph Waldo Emerson once said:

&lt;i&gt;They are of the least pretension and of the greatest capacity of anything that exists. They come and go like muffled and veiled figures, sent from a distant friendly party; but they say nothing, and if we do not use the gifts they bring, they carry them as silently away.&lt;/i&gt; [Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Works and Days," &lt;i&gt;Society and Solitude,&lt;/i&gt; 1870]

I still can vividly recall the time I realized that I should savor and treasure each day and be thankful for and appreciate life. I somehow realized that each day is a gift from a loving Heavenly Father and that if I did not view each day as such, I would be ungrateful. I was always wanting tomorrow or, in my case, the weekend. This was a terrible thing because I was neglecting my todays for my tomorrows.

Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin put it best when he stated:

&lt;i&gt;One thing I know for certain: the time we have here goes by far too quickly. Dont waste any more time sitting on the bench watching life pass you by.&lt;/i&gt; [Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Lessons Learned in the Journey of Life," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; December 2000, 12]

Each of you has been given the opportunity to enter the door that opened to allow your entrance to BYU. It is now up to you to be grateful for and relish fully your life as a student here. An appreciation of each day and of life is dependent upon your ability to notice the things that make up those 24 hours. Most often the simple aspects of life may be considered dull and uninteresting. You may overlook the commonplace things that may appear meaningless and ordinary. You may thank your Heavenly Father for the very important or necessary parts of your lives, or what you may consider the "big" blessings, and then forget the "little" ones. Robert Frost expressed this thought in his poem "Dust of Snow" (1923):

&lt;i&gt;The way a crow&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Shook down on me&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The dust of snow&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;From a hemlock tree&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Has given my heart&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A change of mood&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And saved some part&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of a day I had rued.&lt;/i&gt;

On a day he already cursed because it had not likely been a happy one, something happened that at first added to his frustration. As the poet was going under a tree, some snow fell on him as it was knocked off a branch by a crow flying into the sky. At first filled with anger, he looked up only to see the beauty of the black crow as it flew against the contrast of the sky in the background. To him it was a very precious and wonderful moment.

So it can be for you when you see all the beauty that exists in your lives. Gratitude for all that the Lord has given you enables you to appreciate life and treasure each day you have to spend in this earthly existence.

It is unrealistic to ignore that at times there are and will continue to be some days when it may seem impossible to appreciate that particular day and time. Days come where there is disappointment, tragedy, illness, pain, heartache, and suffering. You most likely will wish that that day, and often the days following, would just pass by quickly or that the circumstances causing the pain would never have happened. However, this is not the plan of our Heavenly Father. On days such as these, you must look to your Lord and Savior for sustenance, love, and His atoning sacrifice for all of you.

The life of the Prophet Joseph Smith gives us many examples of days of despair, pain, and sadness. While in Liberty Jail and in the depths of discouragement and tribulation, he was told by the Lord in Doctrine and Covenants 122:7 that "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."

Such it is for you that it needs be that you experience days of sorrow as well as days of joy to prepare you to one day return to your Father in Heavens presence. They are necessary for your eternal progression. These trials test your faith, endurance, and submission to the will of the Lord and are part of Gods plan for you.

The mission of a BYU education is to strengthen you spiritually, enlarge you intellectually, build your character, and help lead you to a lifetime of service. When your days are filled with lessons, activities, friends, the gospel, and a multitude of opportunities to serve and bless the lives of others, you can appreciate and treasure each day whether that day is one of happiness and success or one of sadness and failure. Service and love are two important ingredients for ones appreciation of life, and opportunities for both are in abundance in our university community.

Just as the Lord opened a door for you to be in this devotional today, He will continue to open more doors and will be a beacon of light to follow during your days here. He will make available opportunities and experiences that will enable you to achieve much that will bless your lives each day in areas both secular and temporal. When you seek and listen to the Spirit and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, many blessings will be forthcoming. Your capacity for expanding your horizon of experiences during your time at BYU will be boundless if you but enter the doors that the Lord provides for you commensurate with your faith. In fact, He has said that these doors cannot be shut by others, but you can close them yourself if you choose to shut Him out of your life.

As you make your way on the paths of life, there will be many of these doors and opportunities attainable to you. Some you can anticipate being open as you make choices and decisions to lead you to them. However, some doors you really would like to open for you may not, and you cannot understand why they dont.

Im sure you can recall something you wanted to be or do or have that never came to fruition. At the time you may have been disappointed, sad, or even angry. The door never opened, and some others you would desire in the future may not as well. However, the Lord knows your needs and desires to a much greater extent than you do.

Some doors may not open at the exact time you desire, but they will open when the Lord sees fit, so you must put your trust in Him and in His wisdom and understanding. Marvelous gateways are opened when you keep the Lords word (see Revelation 3:8) and center your life on the teachings of Jesus Christ. He teaches that your life is priceless and precious, and your gratitude and appreciation for it will bless your sojourn here.

My dear brothers and sisters, I hope that you will treasure each day during your time as a student at Brigham Young University, whether it is measured in weeks, months, or years. Enjoy life; be happy; have fun; be productive; give service and love to others; and, especially, be faithful. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Today is January 8, 2008, and the beginning of a new semester at Brigham Young University. I always look forward to the start of a new year with great anticipation, wondering what the days will bring as the year unfolds. I do know that this beautiful campus will be filled with the excitement and activity that always occur when you are here. Each day can provide experiences that can make your time at BYU the means to achieving your goals and the righteous desires of your hearts.</p>
<p>Each of you has taken a different pathway that has resulted in your attending Brigham Young University. You have come from all over the world and represent many different nations and cultures. For some of you, it is your first time at BYU. For others, this semester is a continuation of your schooling at this institution. I believe that the Lord has, in His loving and caring way, opened the door for you to enter this university. The Lord has told you that He will open doors to bless your lives if you remember Him. In Revelation 3:8 we read, "Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."</p>
<p>It is now your opportunity to immerse yourself in the BYU experience and take advantage of all that is available for you in learning things spiritual and temporal, serving and caring, and enhancing your testimonies of the teachings of the Savior, whose birth we have just celebrated. The Lord has stated that He will continue to open doors for you if you remember Him and keep His commandments.</p>
<p>Brigham Young once said, "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the worlds work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University," <i>Improvement Era,</i> vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920], 831). I especially am drawn to the last part of his definition: "the power to appreciate life."</p>
<p>When my husband and I were first married, he was an undergraduate student with a goal of attending medical school, and I was teaching sixth grade. His classes, part-time work, and studies obviously took most of his time. My obligations with work and spending evenings doing all that was necessary to fulfill my teaching responsibilities also took many hours to complete. Once we included our Church callings, we didnt have much time together during the week. I found that I was always looking forward to Friday evenings, when not only would things become more relaxed but we could have some time together as well as a little social life during the weekends. I always seemed to have the "thank goodness its Friday" mentality. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays I was always looking forward to the weekends; thus I was not really enjoying the weekdays. I was happy on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays and a little depressed on the weekdays.</p>
<p>However, one day something occurred that caused me to see this negative outlook in a new light. I cant recall what caused this change in my attitude, but I was struck with the thought that by wanting the weekdays to pass by quickly and always looking forward to the weekends, I was wishing a very important part of my life away. I realized that my time <i>now</i> was valuable and I should appreciate every day - not wish it away! After all, I didnt know how many Mondays through Fridays I had in my future. Time passes quickly enough, and, because I wanted it to do so, I did not take full advantage of some valuable opportunities and experiences that were available to me.</p>
<p>Concerning the days of your lives, Ralph Waldo Emerson once said:</p>
<p><i>They are of the least pretension and of the greatest capacity of anything that exists. They come and go like muffled and veiled figures, sent from a distant friendly party; but they say nothing, and if we do not use the gifts they bring, they carry them as silently away.</i> [Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Works and Days," <i>Society and Solitude,</i> 1870]</p>
<p>I still can vividly recall the time I realized that I should savor and treasure each day and be thankful for and appreciate life. I somehow realized that each day is a gift from a loving Heavenly Father and that if I did not view each day as such, I would be ungrateful. I was always wanting tomorrow or, in my case, the weekend. This was a terrible thing because I was neglecting my todays for my tomorrows.</p>
<p>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin put it best when he stated:</p>
<p><i>One thing I know for certain: the time we have here goes by far too quickly. Dont waste any more time sitting on the bench watching life pass you by.</i> [Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Lessons Learned in the Journey of Life," <i>Ensign,</i> December 2000, 12]</p>
<p>Each of you has been given the opportunity to enter the door that opened to allow your entrance to BYU. It is now up to you to be grateful for and relish fully your life as a student here. An appreciation of each day and of life is dependent upon your ability to notice the things that make up those 24 hours. Most often the simple aspects of life may be considered dull and uninteresting. You may overlook the commonplace things that may appear meaningless and ordinary. You may thank your Heavenly Father for the very important or necessary parts of your lives, or what you may consider the "big" blessings, and then forget the "little" ones. Robert Frost expressed this thought in his poem "Dust of Snow" (1923):</p>
<p><i>The way a crow</i></p>
<p><i>Shook down on me</i></p>
<p><i>The dust of snow</i></p>
<p><i>From a hemlock tree</i></p>
<p><i>Has given my heart</i></p>
<p><i>A change of mood</i></p>
<p><i>And saved some part</i></p>
<p><i>Of a day I had rued.</i></p>
<p>On a day he already cursed because it had not likely been a happy one, something happened that at first added to his frustration. As the poet was going under a tree, some snow fell on him as it was knocked off a branch by a crow flying into the sky. At first filled with anger, he looked up only to see the beauty of the black crow as it flew against the contrast of the sky in the background. To him it was a very precious and wonderful moment.</p>
<p>So it can be for you when you see all the beauty that exists in your lives. Gratitude for all that the Lord has given you enables you to appreciate life and treasure each day you have to spend in this earthly existence.</p>
<p>It is unrealistic to ignore that at times there are and will continue to be some days when it may seem impossible to appreciate that particular day and time. Days come where there is disappointment, tragedy, illness, pain, heartache, and suffering. You most likely will wish that that day, and often the days following, would just pass by quickly or that the circumstances causing the pain would never have happened. However, this is not the plan of our Heavenly Father. On days such as these, you must look to your Lord and Savior for sustenance, love, and His atoning sacrifice for all of you.</p>
<p>The life of the Prophet Joseph Smith gives us many examples of days of despair, pain, and sadness. While in Liberty Jail and in the depths of discouragement and tribulation, he was told by the Lord in Doctrine and Covenants 122:7 that "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."</p>
<p>Such it is for you that it needs be that you experience days of sorrow as well as days of joy to prepare you to one day return to your Father in Heavens presence. They are necessary for your eternal progression. These trials test your faith, endurance, and submission to the will of the Lord and are part of Gods plan for you.</p>
<p>The mission of a BYU education is to strengthen you spiritually, enlarge you intellectually, build your character, and help lead you to a lifetime of service. When your days are filled with lessons, activities, friends, the gospel, and a multitude of opportunities to serve and bless the lives of others, you can appreciate and treasure each day whether that day is one of happiness and success or one of sadness and failure. Service and love are two important ingredients for ones appreciation of life, and opportunities for both are in abundance in our university community.</p>
<p>Just as the Lord opened a door for you to be in this devotional today, He will continue to open more doors and will be a beacon of light to follow during your days here. He will make available opportunities and experiences that will enable you to achieve much that will bless your lives each day in areas both secular and temporal. When you seek and listen to the Spirit and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, many blessings will be forthcoming. Your capacity for expanding your horizon of experiences during your time at BYU will be boundless if you but enter the doors that the Lord provides for you commensurate with your faith. In fact, He has said that these doors cannot be shut by others, but you can close them yourself if you choose to shut Him out of your life.</p>
<p>As you make your way on the paths of life, there will be many of these doors and opportunities attainable to you. Some you can anticipate being open as you make choices and decisions to lead you to them. However, some doors you really would like to open for you may not, and you cannot understand why they dont.</p>
<p>Im sure you can recall something you wanted to be or do or have that never came to fruition. At the time you may have been disappointed, sad, or even angry. The door never opened, and some others you would desire in the future may not as well. However, the Lord knows your needs and desires to a much greater extent than you do.</p>
<p>Some doors may not open at the exact time you desire, but they will open when the Lord sees fit, so you must put your trust in Him and in His wisdom and understanding. Marvelous gateways are opened when you keep the Lords word (see Revelation 3:8) and center your life on the teachings of Jesus Christ. He teaches that your life is priceless and precious, and your gratitude and appreciation for it will bless your sojourn here.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, I hope that you will treasure each day during your time as a student at Brigham Young University, whether it is measured in weeks, months, or years. Enjoy life; be happy; have fun; be productive; give service and love to others; and, especially, be faithful. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of Gods greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a hearts electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.
When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!
Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.
Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The hearts valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!
In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.
It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.
In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israels new king. As he looked over each of Jesses sons, the Lord taught Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).
Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had "a beautiful countenance" and that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]" (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).
In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. My thanks go to those who provided the music this morning. Their music has helped to bring the Spirit to this meeting. I would hope to speak by that Spirit today.
My late friend Robert J. Matthews, who taught religion here at BYU, used to say, "If I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, you will hear things better than I say them." I pray that that can happen today.
I thought it appropriate to begin with a little poem written by a young man that I think might illustrate what sometimes may happen in parents attempts to change the behavior of their children. He wrote:
My parents told me not to smoke - 
I dont. 
Nor listen to a naughty joke - 
I dont. 
They made it plain I must not wink
At pretty girls, or even think
About intoxicating drink - 
I dont. 
To dance and flirt is very wrong - 
I dont. 
Wild youths chase women, wine and song - 
I dont. 
I kiss no girls, not even one - 
I do not know how it is done - 
You wouldnt think I had much fun - 
I DONT. 
["I Dont," Goldendale Sentinel (Klickatat County, Washington), 24 October 1918, 1, gld.stparchive.com/Archive/GLD/GLD10241918P01.php]
Now, you see that this young mans behavior was changed, but not his attitude. What is needed is a change in attitude as well as behavior. So I pose this question: What causes a change in attitude and behavior?
President Boyd K. Packer stated:
True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. 
The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. . . . That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel. ["Little Children," Ensign, November 1986, 17]
The purpose of my presentation today is to explore four points of doctrine as found in the scriptures and in the words of the Brethren.
Principle Number 1: Draw upon the Power of the Word Daily
The prophet Mormon wrote:
And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just - yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them - therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. [Alma 31:5]
When I taught seminary years ago, I wanted to show the youth the power of the word that Alma described. I wanted to show them that if they would make the word of God (as found in the scriptures) a part of their lives, it would change them. I didnt know exactly how to do that, but I tried this way.
On the first day of class I gave them a blank sheet of paper and s</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.
I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.
I remember a saying that I heard once: "A good laugh a day keeps the blues away." I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep lifes ups and downs in perspective and balance.
Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: "Hey, anybody got a straw?" Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation - especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that its all right, we understand, or were here to help.
In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that "a merry heart doeth good like a medicine." If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, "be of good cheer" (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a res</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesnt begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I cant help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.
I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.
Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!
Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.
What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I dont know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naive sometimes about life. I cant remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:
Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.
I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so m</span>
