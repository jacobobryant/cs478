  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you to President Keetch, and thank you to that wonderful choir. You are wonderful, and I appreciate it.

First of all I’d like to clear up that rumor making the rounds in certain singles wards: I did not date Brigham Young. (At least give me the benefit of Heber J. Grant!)

Some of you may be wondering what I could say that you haven’t heard before. Well, I’ve been wondering the same thing! I can promise you that I won’t talk about the saving powers of scrapbooking or tuna casseroles—I don’t do either of those very well.

You see, the reason I’ve worried so much about this talk is because I know who you are. I see how valiantly you strive to live the gospel. I feel a great love for you. And so I have wanted to say something that would matter in your lives, that would give you hope to not give up, that would lift and inspire you.

But I wasn’t getting any answers. So I finally resigned myself to stand here and sing “‘Give,’ Said the Little Stream” or other Primary songs. I can guarantee you haven’t heard that before!

To spare you that fate worse than death, I returned to the temple, fasting and praying. And this time I received specific direction. Oh, for a spiritual laser printer.

President Gordon B. Hinckley recently described you as being “faithful and true” &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in your desires for righteousness. Heavenly Father sees your goodness; that is why He has inspired me with a message specifically for you.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonnie-isms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As my four sons were growing up, I had a few sayings that I used repeatedly to help keep them on track—my oldest son calls them “Bonnie-isms.” Here are a few examples:

&lt;i&gt;The Holy Ghost goes to bed at midnight.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Truth is truth wherever it is found.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Fair is where you go to see the pigs.&lt;/i&gt;

Among my many Bonnie-isms there were two I used frequently. If I had to remind my sons about an unfinished chore and they responded, “I &lt;i&gt;know!” &lt;/i&gt; my standard reply was, &lt;i&gt;” To know is to do!” &lt;/i&gt;

And almost every time they ran out our back door for a date, a football game, or a dance, I would call another Bonnie-ism after them: &lt;i&gt;” Remember who you are!” &lt;/i&gt;

There is power in these two phrases. Let me explain. When we know something—truly &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; it—then we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; it.

For example, once you know it’s easier to get a date when you use deodorant, you’ll use it, right?

One of the most important things to know is something Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: “You have been you for a long time.” &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He’s trying to help us remember &lt;i&gt;who we are.&lt;/i&gt; Because &lt;i&gt;knowing&lt;/i&gt; who you are changes what you &lt;i&gt;do.&lt;/i&gt;

Case in point: If you know—and remember—who you are and remember your divine birthright, you will date noble people, wear modest clothing, use clean language, surf worthy Web sites, listen to good music, watch enriching movies, keep the Word of Wisdom, and stay morally clean. You will study your scriptures, forgive each other, say your prayers, repent of your sins, serve others, magnify your callings, and love one another.

But remembering what you know can be especially tricky during this time of your life. You’re pursuing so many worthwhile goals: an education, a job, an eternal companion. (Get out there and find each other, will you please!) Sometimes, in pursuit of worthy goals, we lose sight of what matters most.

I know you think life has yet to begin, but gaining the knowledge of your eternal identity happens &lt;i&gt;right now—&lt;/i&gt;at your very stage of life. Not &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; you’re married or &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; you’ve graduated or &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; you’ve learned to use deodorant. It comes &lt;i&gt;right now, before&lt;/i&gt; all that stuff! “Seek not the things of this world,” said Jesus, “but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you” (JST, Matthew 6:38).

Part of seeking the kingdom first is seeking &lt;i&gt;your specific place&lt;/i&gt; in the kingdom. That changes everything!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Making of a Prophet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Let me tell you a story. A few years ago a little baby was taken from his poor family to be raised by a wealthy family as their son. Initially he knew nothing of his true identity. He lived like royalty, taking advantage of the poor—including his own family—to increase his adoptive family’s wealth. But one fateful day he learned the truth of his origin. Even his religion was different. He was heartsick about having inflicted such pain on those he should have protected and loved. And so he knew he would have to make things right. That man’s name was Moses.

After this mighty change of heart, Moses became a great prophet. He knew the Lord. He witnessed and participated in incredible miracles—escaping from Egypt, parting the Red Sea, and receiving the Ten Commandments. He had innumerable spiritual experiences. Yet he never stopped asking Heavenly Father for &lt;i&gt;further&lt;/i&gt; light and knowledge. Thus the more he learned from God, the more he became like God. Isn’t that our desire?

Let’s look at chapter 1 of the Pearl of Great Price. Let’s figure out firsthand what we must do to learn what Moses knew. As we think about &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; journey, liken it unto yours (see 1 Nephi 19:23), for what was promised to Moses is promised to you.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Mountain of the Lord&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The chapter opens with Moses at the top of a high mountain (see Moses 1:1). Frequently in the scriptures, a mountain represents a holy place away from the world, a place of revelation—like the temple (see Micah 4:1). To learn the things of heaven, Moses removes himself from the world. This is significant!

I recently asked a group of sisters your same age what single thing kept them from knowing who they truly are. Can you guess their first answer? They said the loud, distracting, powerful pull of the world. Can you relate? Separating ourselves from the world both in distance &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; in worthiness is an act of great struggle—like Moses scaling that mountain. But what incredible blessings await those who do so.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Son of God in Glory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Verse 2 tells us that here, away from the world, Moses “saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses.” Can you imagine such an experience! I hope so, because Heavenly Father also wants to talk to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; face to face and shine His glory upon you. As of right now, you probably haven’t experienced God’s &lt;i&gt;full&lt;/i&gt; glory. But each time you feel the love of the Lord in your life, you are experiencing a &lt;i&gt;portion&lt;/i&gt; of His glory. Never take those experiences for granted—because the glory of God is powerful stuff. It enables Moses to endure God’s presence, to judge between good and evil, to receive saving strength.

Would you like to know what Moses and Heavenly Father talked about in that glory?

First, Heavenly Father introduces Himself. He speaks tender, comforting words to Moses: “Behold, &lt;i&gt;thou art my son” &lt;/i&gt; (Moses 1:4; emphasis added). What a powerful statement. Moses is a child of the living God! Throughout this chapter Heavenly Father continually calls Moses “my son.” This revelation should be no less powerful for you—because you, too, are a child of the living God!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Work to Do: Look, and He Will Show&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
“ Wherefore,” says Heavenly Father—or, in other words, &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; you are my son—” look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands” (Moses 1:4). And so it is with you! Because you, too, are His child, look, and He will show you what you need to know.

And then Heavenly Father reveals, “I have a &lt;i&gt;work for thee,&lt;/i&gt; Moses, my son” (Moses 1:6; emphasis added). Wow! He who can do all things had a mission—&lt;i&gt;a purpose—&lt;/i&gt;for Moses. Moses was being entrusted to assist God. Do you think at that moment Moses might have felt a little inadequate? (See Exodus 4:10–16.) I certainly would have.

When President Hinckley extended my current calling as Relief Society general president, I was more than overwhelmed—I was flusterpated! But remembering my divine heritage gave me confidence to accept this assignment. I imagine it was similar for Moses. Maybe that’s why President Harold B. Lee once observed, “What a difference it would make if we really sensed our divine relationship to God, our Heavenly Father.” &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

You are a child of God, and He has sent you here. Thus it is essential that you learn why you are here. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Unless [the Saints of God] have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing is according to the will of God they will grow weary in their minds, and faint.” &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

What might &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; work be? You have unique talents and abilities to develop. You need to marry and have a family, you have callings to fulfill, you have brothers and sisters to love and serve. You see, those gifts that make you most unique are those that require your energy. Some assignments can be accomplished by anyone, but others require someone special. Think of Jesus or Joseph Smith or Moses. Think of yourself, for “who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14). Who knoweth? Well, your Father in Heaven knows—that’s who.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Scripture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
How can He tell you the work He has for you? Of course there are many ways, but chief among them is your patriarchal blessing. President Hinckley explains that when you receive your blessing, “A man of God lays his hands upon [your] head and &lt;i&gt;speaking as a prophet&lt;/i&gt; bestows a blessing, setting forth the great possibility that you have in this life.” &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Your patriarchal blessing protects you from becoming weary in your mind. It reminds you who you are. It is personal scripture of the work you have to do and what you need to know about yourself.

Look what Heavenly Father tells Moses about himself: “Moses, my son, . . . &lt;i&gt;thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten;&lt;/i&gt; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior” (Moses 1:6; emphasis added). Moses’ mission was not to unlock the gate to eternal life, but, in &lt;i&gt;similitude&lt;/i&gt; of the Savior, he saved the children of Israel from bondage and led them to the promised land.

Moses is not alone at being in the similitude of Jesus with a unique work to do. You are right there with him with your unique mission, which includes being a savior on Mount Zion (see Obadiah 1:21).

Have you received your patriarchal blessing? Do you read it often? Do you pray about it? I hope so, because it’s pretty hard to do what you don’t know! Right now is the time to discover your mission. And if you’ll oppose the world’s pull, Heavenly Father will show you.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spiritual Eyes Versus Natural Eyes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Heavenly Father shows Moses this world and worlds without end “and all the children of men which are, and which were created.” And of this Moses “greatly marveled and wondered” (Moses 1:8).

But then, after such awesome enlightenment, “the presence of God [withdraws] from Moses, that his glory [is] not upon Moses.” Now listen to this next phrase: “And &lt;i&gt;Moses [is] left unto himself.&lt;/i&gt; And as he was left unto himself, he [falls] unto the earth” (Moses 1:9; emphasis added). There is a great truth there: When we are separated from God’s glory, we are left to ourselves. And when we are left to ourselves, it is much easier to fall.

It took “many hours” for Moses to regain his strength. And he sums up his experience thus far with a new perspective, saying, “I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed” (Moses 1:10). Can you relate? Moses sees his place amongst God’s creations and is astonished. And yet, of all those creations, God appeared to Moses to show him his mission. I find that astonishing. Nevertheless, I know this is how He operates with each of His children, including &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;

Reflecting on it all, Moses does not question what he has seen. In fact, he acknowledges &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;he saw it: “But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face” (Moses 1:11).

As was true for Moses, we cannot come to know our calling with our natural eyes—natural eyes do not require faith! Paul teaches us that the beautiful truths of the kingdom are

&lt;i&gt;revealed . . . unto us by his Spirit. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so&lt;/i&gt; the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. [1 Corinthians 2:10–11; emphasis added]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Test of Faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Even after such a life-changing experience, Moses’ struggles are not over. In fact, because there is “opposition in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11), his great highs will be matched with deep lows. After all, it’s easy to remain true to our faith without the challenges to try that faith; true faith is only made manifest in the face of heart-piercing trials. Moses—like all of us—has to learn and prove just how stalwart he is with his new knowledge.

As Moses rejoices in what he had witnessed, “Behold, Satan [comes] tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me” (Moses 1:12).

Did you notice the very first thing Satan says to Moses? It is the direct opposite of what God had said! Listen to Lucifer again: “Moses, &lt;i&gt;son of man,&lt;/i&gt; worship me.” Do you see it? Satan goes for the jugular by calling into question Moses’ divine birthright and, thus, his very identity. “You’re no son of &lt;i&gt;God,” &lt;/i&gt; Satan says, “you’re a mere son of &lt;i&gt;man.” &lt;/i&gt; For Satan understands that the slide into captivity begins with doubts about who we really are.

But Moses is a pretty smart guy. He doesn’t say, “Okay, you’re probably right. Let’s go eat, drink, and be merry.” Instead, he fires right back: “Who art thou? For behold, &lt;i&gt;I am a son of God” &lt;/i&gt; (emphasis added). And then Moses strengthens that declaration by adding, “I am . . . in the similitude of his Only Begotten” (Moses 1:13). Do you see the power that comes from knowing who you are?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucifer’s Need for Idolization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
And did you detect one of Satan’s fixations? It is two simple words: “Worship me” (Moses 1:12, 19). That obsession hasn’t changed.

Because of their past, Lucifer is insanely jealous of his brother Jehovah. Lucifer craves being idolized. But he mistakes idolization for adoration, reverence, and veneration. Thus, like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum, he screams, “Worship &lt;i&gt;me—&lt;/i&gt;not Him.”

But most of us aren’t that stupid to just worship Satan outright—are we? We need a little enticement. So Old Scratch is happy to provide it. When tempting Jesus—who was Jehovah in the flesh—Lucifer used the same bait he still uses today: appetites, riches, and power.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; In short, the things of this world. And Jesus could have all that cash and those fabulous prizes—if He would only worship Satan (see Luke 4:1–13).

I know that you are a choice group of Heavenly Father’s children. But the Lord has very specific counsel for His chosen: “There are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? &lt;i&gt;Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men” &lt;/i&gt; (D&amp;amp;C 121:34–35; emphasis added). Lucifer knows this! Why else would he put so much energy into showing us the things of this world?

You see, “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon” (Matthew 6:24).

Unfortunately, there are legions listening to Lucifer’s calls to worship him. Just two months ago President Hinckley said something that stopped my heart. He said, “I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah [than today]. . . . Similar conditions . . . prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters.” &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This is a powerful pronouncement. But I agree.

Again, you are a choice group of Heavenly Father’s children; your attendance at this fireside further demonstrates your desire for righteousness. But, like Moses, this also makes you a larger target for the adversary. Every righteous soul that Satan seduces from the truth becomes a game hunter’s trophy, prominently mounted and displayed on the walls of hell.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Lucifer Entices Us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
How does Satan entice us to worship him? By indulging our appetites, offering us riches, and promising us power. Of course he needs someone to show us his wares, and he has no end of eager salesmen.

One of the most powerful persuasives is the visual image. A brother I know calls television “the devil’s home teacher.” And aside from the Lord, nobody understands the power of images, decibels, and repetition better than Satan. Satan knows the sway of “everybody’s doing it.” He knows if he dangles his merchandise in front of you long enough, your heart just might get hooked on the things of this world.

In last October’s general conference, Elder M. Russell Ballard said:

&lt;i&gt;The choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life. Choosing the trendy, the titillating, the tawdry in the TV programs or movies we watch can cause us to end up, if we’re not careful, choosing the same things in the lives we live.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

And then he encouraged us to follow the counsel in the pamphlet &lt;i&gt;For the Strength of Youth:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Do not attend, view, or participate in entertainment that is vulgar, immoral, violent, or pornographic in any way. Do not participate in entertainment that in any way presents immorality or violent behavior as acceptable. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Have the courage to walk out of a movie or video party, turn off a computer or television, change a radio station, or put down a magazine if what is being presented does not meet Heavenly Father’s standards. Do these things even if others do not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucifer’s Temples&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What words do you use to describe the temple? I use words like &lt;i&gt;holiness, peace, worthiness, calmness, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;light.&lt;/i&gt; The Lord Himself says His house is “a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God” (D&amp;amp;C 88:119). The increase in temples around the world is another testament to me of the truthfulness of the gospel.

But as God’s temples spread across the world, so, too, do Satan’s. The success of his missionary work also requires a place for his converts. After all, how can he be worshiped without a sanctuary? Opposites of the words we just used for God’s temples describe Satan’s: &lt;i&gt;filthy, wicked, loud,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dark.&lt;/i&gt; Consider the ever-lengthening strip of Las Vegas’s casinos. In Lucifer’s temples—now advertised as “family friendly” —appetites are satisfied in spades; more is not enough; anarchy trumps order. And all the while our spirits are blinded by the lights, deafened by the din, and bludgeoned by the beats.

One day that power will be shut off; the lights and music will cease. And “they who are filthy shall be filthy still . . . and . . . shall go away into everlasting fire” (2 Nephi 9:16).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The State of the World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I don’t emphasize these things to scare you. But “we wrestle not against flesh and blood,” said Paul, “but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places” (Ephesians 6:12).

Listen to what President Boyd K. Packer taught just over a month ago:

&lt;i&gt;The world is spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell you that&lt;/i&gt; it will not get better.

&lt;i&gt;It is my purpose to . . . put you on alert.&lt;/i&gt; These are days of great spiritual danger for our youth.

&lt;i&gt;I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

Of course Lucifer’s temples are not just casinos. You know where and what they are—they are places where men and women are persuaded “to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God” (Moroni 7:17). They are places where Satan’s demand of “Worship me!” is heeded, where loud music and rough language drown out the still small voice, where darkness—not glory—is desired.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glory Versus Darkness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
How ironic for Satan, then, that this very contrast between glory and darkness helps Moses recognize Satan. Had Moses not experienced God’s glory, the darkness would have been less obvious. But Moses remembers, so he asks Lucifer:

&lt;i&gt;And where is&lt;/i&gt; thy &lt;i&gt;glory, that I should worship&lt;/i&gt; thee?

&lt;i&gt;For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me. . . . But I can look upon thee in the natural man. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Thy glory . . . is darkness unto me[.] And&lt;/i&gt; I can judge between thee and God. [Moses 1:13–15; emphasis added]

What empowering words!

All of you have experienced some level of God’s glory. If not, you would not be here. And all of you have experienced some level of Satan’s darkness. In this you are no different from Moses either. So, like Moses, &lt;i&gt;you can judge!&lt;/i&gt; You know the pain of your spirit being wounded by sin or the devastation of the Holy Ghost leaving when offended or the despair of losing self-control. But you also know the sweetness of forgiveness, the transcendence of testimony, and the humble gratitude for answered prayers. You have felt the love of the Lord in your life; you have felt His glory. This is why &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can judge between glory and darkness, between God and Lucifer!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Banishing Satan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Knowing that God is completely honest (see Deuteronomy 32:4), Moses also knows that Satan is deceitful. Thus Moses doesn’t invite the father of lies to stay for lunch so as not to offend him. No, Moses cuts right to the chase: “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not” (Moses 1:16).

This is a powerful command—but not too powerful for a son or daughter of God to make! You, too, are a child of God. And you, too, can say, “Get thee hence, Satan.” In fact, there will be times you will &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to say it.

Moses is strengthened by knowing his divine birthright and thus declared an unwavering commitment to Heavenly Father. He reminds Satan that

&lt;i&gt;God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship&lt;/i&gt; me. [Moses 1:16–17; emphasis added]

In other words, Moses is going to honor his covenants. He reiterates his commitment, saying:

&lt;i&gt;I will&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 1:18; emphasis added]

You see this pattern again and again. Moses has seen God’s glory (or felt the love of the Lord in his life), he remembers it—his judgment is not impaired by Satan’s deceptions—and thus he can cast Satan out with confidence. Make this your pattern, too.

Further, if a man of Moses’ stature and testimony is still humble enough to realize that he cannot cease to call upon God, what does that mean for you? Brothers and sisters, at all times and in all places—but especially in the face of great trials and tribulations—&lt;i&gt;you cannot give up praying to Heavenly Father! &lt;/i&gt;You must just keep trying, even if the heavens seem sealed and silent.

President Hinckley said, “We must get on our knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction.” &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

So after Moses commands Satan to leave, “Satan crie[s] with a loud voice, and rant[s] upon the earth, and command[s,] saying: &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am the Only Begotten, worship me” (Moses 1:19; emphasis added). That is a lie, plain and simple. Lucifer is forever trying to be someone he’s not.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faith and Fear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Lucifer’s exit must have exceeded anything Moses had ever witnessed, because “Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell” (Moses 1:20).

Verse 20 is crucial to remember because it shows us that Satan does not give up easily, or go quietly. He might preach instant gratification and self-indulgence, but he knows the power of patience and self-denial. Why else is he called the “cunning one” (2 Nephi 9:39)? Thus, Satan’s fury can strike fear into the hearts of men, even men like Moses—and like you. That is a scary thought, because as soon as Moses became afraid, he could see into the very depths of hell. But did you know that fear can overcome faith? All of us have times of fear—remember Peter walking on the water?

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught a most extraordinary truth:

&lt;i&gt;For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the same time; so that persons whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is not there faith is weak; and where faith is weak the persons will not be able to contend against all the opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will have power over them and destroy them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Jesus told Peter: “Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, &lt;i&gt;that thy faith fail not” &lt;/i&gt;(Luke 22:31–32; emphasis added). Jesus knew that faith—not fear—will conquer Satan.

It is fear that overtakes Moses. But his fear does not last long enough to give Satan any advantage. Do you know why? Look at verse 20 again:

&lt;i&gt;Nevertheless,&lt;/i&gt; calling upon God, he received strength, &lt;i&gt;and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . And he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 1:20, 22; emphasis added]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Binding Satan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What did Moses, the great prophet, do to escape his fear? He had no secret weapon that you don’t have. He prayed. He needed that divine assistance because Satan is persistent. It takes Moses &lt;i&gt;four &lt;/i&gt;times to drive Satan out. Four times! (Even my sons usually minded after three times—well, most of the time.) Imagine if Moses had given up after three times.

In your deepest times of temptation and fear, like Moses, you must &lt;i&gt;plead with Heavenly Father as frequently and as long as necessary&lt;/i&gt; to retain your faith. If you do not, Lucifer will lurk nearby until your defenses drop—and then return with enticings to worship him and fears to stop your heart. It is not easy—but nothing of worth is.

Nearly 30 years ago Elder Eldred G. Smith gave some wonderful counsel about standing up to Lucifer:

&lt;i&gt;The only power I know of that will bind Satan, or render him powerless, is righteous living.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Even Jesus Christ had to bind Satan when he was tempted in the wilderness. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When you have resisted a temptation until it no longer becomes a temptation, then to that extent, Satan has lost his power over you, and as long as you do not yield to him, to that degree he is bound.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

With Satan finally gone, “Moses lift[s] up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son” (Moses 1:24).

You have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost, who testifies of the truth. You are entitled to His presence and direction according to your faithfulness. Let Him help you!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rewards of Faithfulness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
“ And calling upon the name of God, he [Moses] beh[olds] his glory again, for it [is] upon him” (Moses 1:25). Did you notice that Heavenly Father’s glory has returned?

Continuing in verse 25, Heavenly Father begins pouring out blessings upon Moses to reward his loyalty. God’s first words are ones of comfort and encouragement: “Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have &lt;i&gt;chosen &lt;/i&gt;thee” (emphasis added). Being chosen by God is no small thing. Do you remember why many are called but few are chosen? Satan had offered Moses the worldly menu, but Moses denied himself “of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; ungodliness” (Moroni 10:32; emphasis added). Thus Moses is chosen because his heart is set upon the things of his Father.

And now, after that crucible of temptation, God knows Moses can be trusted completely, and—just as important—&lt;i&gt;Moses&lt;/i&gt; knows he is completely trustworthy. So Heavenly Father is able to further reward Moses with increased knowledge about his mission. Listen:

&lt;i&gt;And thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from bondage, even Israel my chosen.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 1:25–26]

What great promises! Can you hear the foreshadowing of “all that my Father hath shall be given unto [you]” (D&amp;amp;C 84:38)?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whose&lt;/i&gt; We Are&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Heavenly Father proceeds to reveal His innumerable creations and answer Moses’ questions about those creations. And then Heavenly Father says something that even though I cannot comprehend it, I know to be true: “For behold, there are many worlds. . . . And innumerable are they unto man; but &lt;i&gt;all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;I know them” &lt;/i&gt; (Moses 1:35; emphasis added).

Can you believe it? Even with all those innumerable creations, God knows Moses. And I testify that He also knows &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; How do I know? Because He knows &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; Because He has inspired my words for you tonight. We are numbered to Him because &lt;i&gt;we are His.&lt;/i&gt;

My counselor and dear friend, Anne C. Pingree, made a wonderful observation that not only are we “blessed to know who we are,” we are blessed to know “&lt;i&gt;whose&lt;/i&gt; we are.” &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Great Reward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Moses had been taught who he was, he had been given his work, and he had been shown whose he was. And then, because he had proven himself unshakable, he was ready to learn Heavenly Father’s work and glory. From this seemingly simple revelation in Moses 1, the gospel and everything we do in it is unified and infused with eternal significance. Here is that stunning revelation in verse 39: “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”

This sublime statement is the crowning reward for Moses’ faithfulness and steadfastness. Its insight extends to us, changing our actions. It is a perfect example of how knowing leads to doing.

But remember that this pearl of great price came at a great price. It was received only &lt;i&gt;after &lt;/i&gt;Moses had removed himself from the things of this world, had experienced divine love and glory, had learned who he was and what his work would be, had made covenants with his Father in Heaven, and had resisted Satan unceasingly with testimony and prayer.

Some of you may be struggling with knowing who you are. There’s a little secret about “to know is to do” : the flip side is also true—” to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; is to &lt;i&gt;know!” &lt;/i&gt; In other words, if you’re unsure, just do anyway. Jesus has promised, “If any man will &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; [my Father’s] will, he shall &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; of the doctrine, whether it be of God” (John 7:17; emphasis added). Do, and you’ll know.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember Who You Are!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Like Moses, you are a son or daughter of God in the similitude of His Only Begotten Son. Like Moses, you can do every single one of these things! And, therefore, like Moses, you can receive every single one of these incredible blessings.

Listen to the words Peter taught, referring to promises the Savior had made to others: “For the promise is unto &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; and to &lt;i&gt;your children,&lt;/i&gt; and to all that are afar off” (Acts 2:39; emphasis added).

And so this is why I tell my children and my grandchildren and each one of you, “Remember who you are.” Or, as the Lord said, “Remember the worth of souls is great” (D&amp;amp;C 18:10).

This is why I say, “To know is to do.” Or, as the Savior said—and I like what was added—” If ye know these things, happy are ye &lt;i&gt;if ye do them” &lt;/i&gt; (John 13:17; emphasis added).

I hope you feel energized and, as my boys say, “pumped up” to overcome the challenges that are uniquely yours for this unique time. You can conquer!

When you feel down, remember, you don’t have to do it alone. Many, like Moses, have gone before you and have successfully overcome hard things. You can too. Many—like President Hinckley, the Apostles, your bishop, your parents, and even I—pray for you daily. You can, and you must, pray too. You are children of God, and He has sent you here! His work and His glory is to bring to pass &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; immortality and eternal life.

Recently President Hinckley gave us wonderful encouragement:

[You] &lt;i&gt;must not give up.&lt;/i&gt; [You] &lt;i&gt;must not become discouraged.&lt;/i&gt; [You] &lt;i&gt;must never surrender to the forces of evil.&lt;/i&gt; [You] &lt;i&gt;can and must maintain the standards for which this Church has stood since it was organized. There is a better way than the way of the world.&lt;/i&gt; If it means standing alone, [you] must do it. . . .

. . . [You] &lt;i&gt;must get on&lt;/i&gt; [your] &lt;i&gt;knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction.&lt;/i&gt; [You] &lt;i&gt;must then stand on&lt;/i&gt; [your] &lt;i&gt;feet and move forward.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I am absolutely confident that heaven will smile upon&lt;/i&gt; [you]. &lt;i&gt;The Lord will hear and answer&lt;/i&gt; [your] &lt;i&gt;prayers if&lt;/i&gt; [you] &lt;i&gt;will commit&lt;/i&gt; [yourself], &lt;i&gt;giving&lt;/i&gt; [your] &lt;i&gt;very best to this work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

Moses showed us that this is true.

Tonight as you run out the door to life’s adventures, let me give you two Bonnie-isms for the road. They are filled with all the love in my heart: &lt;i&gt;Remember who you are. To know is to do!&lt;/i&gt;

I pray that you, like your brother Moses, will let Heavenly Father lead you, guide you, and walk beside you, because I testify that He will. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Thank you to President Keetch, and thank you to that wonderful choir. You are wonderful, and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>First of all I’d like to clear up that rumor making the rounds in certain singles wards: I did not date Brigham Young. (At least give me the benefit of Heber J. Grant!)</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering what I could say that you haven’t heard before. Well, I’ve been wondering the same thing! I can promise you that I won’t talk about the saving powers of scrapbooking or tuna casseroles—I don’t do either of those very well.</p>
<p>You see, the reason I’ve worried so much about this talk is because I know who you are. I see how valiantly you strive to live the gospel. I feel a great love for you. And so I have wanted to say something that would matter in your lives, that would give you hope to not give up, that would lift and inspire you.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t getting any answers. So I finally resigned myself to stand here and sing “‘Give,’ Said the Little Stream” or other Primary songs. I can guarantee you haven’t heard that before!</p>
<p>To spare you that fate worse than death, I returned to the temple, fasting and praying. And this time I received specific direction. Oh, for a spiritual laser printer.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley recently described you as being “faithful and true” <sup>1</sup> in your desires for righteousness. Heavenly Father sees your goodness; that is why He has inspired me with a message specifically for you.</p>
<h2><b>Bonnie-isms</b></h2>
<p>As my four sons were growing up, I had a few sayings that I used repeatedly to help keep them on track—my oldest son calls them “Bonnie-isms.” Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><i>The Holy Ghost goes to bed at midnight.</i></p>
<p><i>Truth is truth wherever it is found.</i></p>
<p><i>Fair is where you go to see the pigs.</i></p>
<p>Among my many Bonnie-isms there were two I used frequently. If I had to remind my sons about an unfinished chore and they responded, “I <i>know!” </i> my standard reply was, <i>” To know is to do!” </i></p>
<p>And almost every time they ran out our back door for a date, a football game, or a dance, I would call another Bonnie-ism after them: <i>” Remember who you are!” </i></p>
<p>There is power in these two phrases. Let me explain. When we know something—truly <i>understand</i> it—then we <i>do</i> it.</p>
<p>For example, once you know it’s easier to get a date when you use deodorant, you’ll use it, right?</p>
<p>One of the most important things to know is something Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: “You have been you for a long time.” <sup>2</sup> He’s trying to help us remember <i>who we are.</i> Because <i>knowing</i> who you are changes what you <i>do.</i></p>
<p>Case in point: If you know—and remember—who you are and remember your divine birthright, you will date noble people, wear modest clothing, use clean language, surf worthy Web sites, listen to good music, watch enriching movies, keep the Word of Wisdom, and stay morally clean. You will study your scriptures, forgive each other, say your prayers, repent of your sins, serve others, magnify your callings, and love one another.</p>
<p>But remembering what you know can be especially tricky during this time of your life. You’re pursuing so many worthwhile goals: an education, a job, an eternal companion. (Get out there and find each other, will you please!) Sometimes, in pursuit of worthy goals, we lose sight of what matters most.</p>
<p>I know you think life has yet to begin, but gaining the knowledge of your eternal identity happens <i>right now—</i>at your very stage of life. Not <i>after</i> you’re married or <i>after</i> you’ve graduated or <i>after</i> you’ve learned to use deodorant. It comes <i>right now, before</i> all that stuff! “Seek not the things of this world,” said Jesus, “but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you” (JST, Matthew 6:38).</p>
<p>Part of seeking the kingdom first is seeking <i>your specific place</i> in the kingdom. That changes everything!</p>
<h2><b>The Making of a Prophet</b></h2>
<p>Let me tell you a story. A few years ago a little baby was taken from his poor family to be raised by a wealthy family as their son. Initially he knew nothing of his true identity. He lived like royalty, taking advantage of the poor—including his own family—to increase his adoptive family’s wealth. But one fateful day he learned the truth of his origin. Even his religion was different. He was heartsick about having inflicted such pain on those he should have protected and loved. And so he knew he would have to make things right. That man’s name was Moses.</p>
<p>After this mighty change of heart, Moses became a great prophet. He knew the Lord. He witnessed and participated in incredible miracles—escaping from Egypt, parting the Red Sea, and receiving the Ten Commandments. He had innumerable spiritual experiences. Yet he never stopped asking Heavenly Father for <i>further</i> light and knowledge. Thus the more he learned from God, the more he became like God. Isn’t that our desire?</p>
<p>Let’s look at chapter 1 of the Pearl of Great Price. Let’s figure out firsthand what we must do to learn what Moses knew. As we think about <i>his</i> journey, liken it unto yours (see 1 Nephi 19:23), for what was promised to Moses is promised to you.</p>
<h2><b>A Mountain of the Lord</b></h2>
<p>The chapter opens with Moses at the top of a high mountain (see Moses 1:1). Frequently in the scriptures, a mountain represents a holy place away from the world, a place of revelation—like the temple (see Micah 4:1). To learn the things of heaven, Moses removes himself from the world. This is significant!</p>
<p>I recently asked a group of sisters your same age what single thing kept them from knowing who they truly are. Can you guess their first answer? They said the loud, distracting, powerful pull of the world. Can you relate? Separating ourselves from the world both in distance <i>and</i> in worthiness is an act of great struggle—like Moses scaling that mountain. But what incredible blessings await those who do so.</p>
<h2><b>A Son of God in Glory</b></h2>
<p>Verse 2 tells us that here, away from the world, Moses “saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses.” Can you imagine such an experience! I hope so, because Heavenly Father also wants to talk to <i>you</i> face to face and shine His glory upon you. As of right now, you probably haven’t experienced God’s <i>full</i> glory. But each time you feel the love of the Lord in your life, you are experiencing a <i>portion</i> of His glory. Never take those experiences for granted—because the glory of God is powerful stuff. It enables Moses to endure God’s presence, to judge between good and evil, to receive saving strength.</p>
<p>Would you like to know what Moses and Heavenly Father talked about in that glory?</p>
<p>First, Heavenly Father introduces Himself. He speaks tender, comforting words to Moses: “Behold, <i>thou art my son” </i> (Moses 1:4; emphasis added). What a powerful statement. Moses is a child of the living God! Throughout this chapter Heavenly Father continually calls Moses “my son.” This revelation should be no less powerful for you—because you, too, are a child of the living God!</p>
<h2><b>A Work to Do: Look, and He Will Show</b></h2>
<p>“ Wherefore,” says Heavenly Father—or, in other words, <i>because</i> you are my son—” look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands” (Moses 1:4). And so it is with you! Because you, too, are His child, look, and He will show you what you need to know.</p>
<p>And then Heavenly Father reveals, “I have a <i>work for thee,</i> Moses, my son” (Moses 1:6; emphasis added). Wow! He who can do all things had a mission—<i>a purpose—</i>for Moses. Moses was being entrusted to assist God. Do you think at that moment Moses might have felt a little inadequate? (See Exodus 4:10–16.) I certainly would have.</p>
<p>When President Hinckley extended my current calling as Relief Society general president, I was more than overwhelmed—I was flusterpated! But remembering my divine heritage gave me confidence to accept this assignment. I imagine it was similar for Moses. Maybe that’s why President Harold B. Lee once observed, “What a difference it would make if we really sensed our divine relationship to God, our Heavenly Father.” <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>You are a child of God, and He has sent you here. Thus it is essential that you learn why you are here. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Unless [the Saints of God] have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing is according to the will of God they will grow weary in their minds, and faint.” <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>What might <i>your</i> work be? You have unique talents and abilities to develop. You need to marry and have a family, you have callings to fulfill, you have brothers and sisters to love and serve. You see, those gifts that make you most unique are those that require your energy. Some assignments can be accomplished by anyone, but others require someone special. Think of Jesus or Joseph Smith or Moses. Think of yourself, for “who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14). Who knoweth? Well, your Father in Heaven knows—that’s who.</p>
<h2><b>Personal Scripture</b></h2>
<p>How can He tell you the work He has for you? Of course there are many ways, but chief among them is your patriarchal blessing. President Hinckley explains that when you receive your blessing, “A man of God lays his hands upon [your] head and <i>speaking as a prophet</i> bestows a blessing, setting forth the great possibility that you have in this life.” <sup>5</sup> Your patriarchal blessing protects you from becoming weary in your mind. It reminds you who you are. It is personal scripture of the work you have to do and what you need to know about yourself.</p>
<p>Look what Heavenly Father tells Moses about himself: “Moses, my son, . . . <i>thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten;</i> and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior” (Moses 1:6; emphasis added). Moses’ mission was not to unlock the gate to eternal life, but, in <i>similitude</i> of the Savior, he saved the children of Israel from bondage and led them to the promised land.</p>
<p>Moses is not alone at being in the similitude of Jesus with a unique work to do. You are right there with him with your unique mission, which includes being a savior on Mount Zion (see Obadiah 1:21).</p>
<p>Have you received your patriarchal blessing? Do you read it often? Do you pray about it? I hope so, because it’s pretty hard to do what you don’t know! Right now is the time to discover your mission. And if you’ll oppose the world’s pull, Heavenly Father will show you.</p>
<h2><b>Spiritual Eyes Versus Natural Eyes</b></h2>
<p>Heavenly Father shows Moses this world and worlds without end “and all the children of men which are, and which were created.” And of this Moses “greatly marveled and wondered” (Moses 1:8).</p>
<p>But then, after such awesome enlightenment, “the presence of God [withdraws] from Moses, that his glory [is] not upon Moses.” Now listen to this next phrase: “And <i>Moses [is] left unto himself.</i> And as he was left unto himself, he [falls] unto the earth” (Moses 1:9; emphasis added). There is a great truth there: When we are separated from God’s glory, we are left to ourselves. And when we are left to ourselves, it is much easier to fall.</p>
<p>It took “many hours” for Moses to regain his strength. And he sums up his experience thus far with a new perspective, saying, “I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed” (Moses 1:10). Can you relate? Moses sees his place amongst God’s creations and is astonished. And yet, of all those creations, God appeared to Moses to show him his mission. I find that astonishing. Nevertheless, I know this is how He operates with each of His children, including <i>you.</i></p>
<p>Reflecting on it all, Moses does not question what he has seen. In fact, he acknowledges <i>how </i>he saw it: “But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face” (Moses 1:11).</p>
<p>As was true for Moses, we cannot come to know our calling with our natural eyes—natural eyes do not require faith! Paul teaches us that the beautiful truths of the kingdom are</p>
<p><i>revealed . . . unto us by his Spirit. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so</i> the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. [1 Corinthians 2:10–11; emphasis added]</p>
<h2><b>The Test of Faith</b></h2>
<p>Even after such a life-changing experience, Moses’ struggles are not over. In fact, because there is “opposition in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11), his great highs will be matched with deep lows. After all, it’s easy to remain true to our faith without the challenges to try that faith; true faith is only made manifest in the face of heart-piercing trials. Moses—like all of us—has to learn and prove just how stalwart he is with his new knowledge.</p>
<p>As Moses rejoices in what he had witnessed, “Behold, Satan [comes] tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me” (Moses 1:12).</p>
<p>Did you notice the very first thing Satan says to Moses? It is the direct opposite of what God had said! Listen to Lucifer again: “Moses, <i>son of man,</i> worship me.” Do you see it? Satan goes for the jugular by calling into question Moses’ divine birthright and, thus, his very identity. “You’re no son of <i>God,” </i> Satan says, “you’re a mere son of <i>man.” </i> For Satan understands that the slide into captivity begins with doubts about who we really are.</p>
<p>But Moses is a pretty smart guy. He doesn’t say, “Okay, you’re probably right. Let’s go eat, drink, and be merry.” Instead, he fires right back: “Who art thou? For behold, <i>I am a son of God” </i> (emphasis added). And then Moses strengthens that declaration by adding, “I am . . . in the similitude of his Only Begotten” (Moses 1:13). Do you see the power that comes from knowing who you are?</p>
<h2><b>Lucifer’s Need for Idolization</b></h2>
<p>And did you detect one of Satan’s fixations? It is two simple words: “Worship me” (Moses 1:12, 19). That obsession hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>Because of their past, Lucifer is insanely jealous of his brother Jehovah. Lucifer craves being idolized. But he mistakes idolization for adoration, reverence, and veneration. Thus, like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum, he screams, “Worship <i>me—</i>not Him.”</p>
<p>But most of us aren’t that stupid to just worship Satan outright—are we? We need a little enticement. So Old Scratch is happy to provide it. When tempting Jesus—who was Jehovah in the flesh—Lucifer used the same bait he still uses today: appetites, riches, and power.<sup>6</sup> In short, the things of this world. And Jesus could have all that cash and those fabulous prizes—if He would only worship Satan (see Luke 4:1–13).</p>
<p>I know that you are a choice group of Heavenly Father’s children. But the Lord has very specific counsel for His chosen: “There are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? <i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men” </i> (D&amp;C 121:34–35; emphasis added). Lucifer knows this! Why else would he put so much energy into showing us the things of this world?</p>
<p>You see, “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon” (Matthew 6:24).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are legions listening to Lucifer’s calls to worship him. Just two months ago President Hinckley said something that stopped my heart. He said, “I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah [than today]. . . . Similar conditions . . . prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters.” <sup>7</sup> This is a powerful pronouncement. But I agree.</p>
<p>Again, you are a choice group of Heavenly Father’s children; your attendance at this fireside further demonstrates your desire for righteousness. But, like Moses, this also makes you a larger target for the adversary. Every righteous soul that Satan seduces from the truth becomes a game hunter’s trophy, prominently mounted and displayed on the walls of hell.</p>
<h2><b>How Lucifer Entices Us</b></h2>
<p>How does Satan entice us to worship him? By indulging our appetites, offering us riches, and promising us power. Of course he needs someone to show us his wares, and he has no end of eager salesmen.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful persuasives is the visual image. A brother I know calls television “the devil’s home teacher.” And aside from the Lord, nobody understands the power of images, decibels, and repetition better than Satan. Satan knows the sway of “everybody’s doing it.” He knows if he dangles his merchandise in front of you long enough, your heart just might get hooked on the things of this world.</p>
<p>In last October’s general conference, Elder M. Russell Ballard said:</p>
<p><i>The choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life. Choosing the trendy, the titillating, the tawdry in the TV programs or movies we watch can cause us to end up, if we’re not careful, choosing the same things in the lives we live.” </i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>And then he encouraged us to follow the counsel in the pamphlet <i>For the Strength of Youth:</i></p>
<p><i>Do not attend, view, or participate in entertainment that is vulgar, immoral, violent, or pornographic in any way. Do not participate in entertainment that in any way presents immorality or violent behavior as acceptable. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Have the courage to walk out of a movie or video party, turn off a computer or television, change a radio station, or put down a magazine if what is being presented does not meet Heavenly Father’s standards. Do these things even if others do not.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<h2><b>Lucifer’s Temples</b></h2>
<p>What words do you use to describe the temple? I use words like <i>holiness, peace, worthiness, calmness, </i>and <i>light.</i> The Lord Himself says His house is “a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God” (D&amp;C 88:119). The increase in temples around the world is another testament to me of the truthfulness of the gospel.</p>
<p>But as God’s temples spread across the world, so, too, do Satan’s. The success of his missionary work also requires a place for his converts. After all, how can he be worshiped without a sanctuary? Opposites of the words we just used for God’s temples describe Satan’s: <i>filthy, wicked, loud,</i> and <i>dark.</i> Consider the ever-lengthening strip of Las Vegas’s casinos. In Lucifer’s temples—now advertised as “family friendly” —appetites are satisfied in spades; more is not enough; anarchy trumps order. And all the while our spirits are blinded by the lights, deafened by the din, and bludgeoned by the beats.</p>
<p>One day that power will be shut off; the lights and music will cease. And “they who are filthy shall be filthy still . . . and . . . shall go away into everlasting fire” (2 Nephi 9:16).</p>
<h2><b>The State of the World</b></h2>
<p>I don’t emphasize these things to scare you. But “we wrestle not against flesh and blood,” said Paul, “but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places” (Ephesians 6:12).</p>
<p>Listen to what President Boyd K. Packer taught just over a month ago:</p>
<p><i>The world is spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell you that</i> it will not get better.</p>
<p><i>It is my purpose to . . . put you on alert.</i> These are days of great spiritual danger for our youth.</p>
<p><i>I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances.</i><sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Of course Lucifer’s temples are not just casinos. You know where and what they are—they are places where men and women are persuaded “to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God” (Moroni 7:17). They are places where Satan’s demand of “Worship me!” is heeded, where loud music and rough language drown out the still small voice, where darkness—not glory—is desired.</p>
<h2><b>Glory Versus Darkness</b></h2>
<p>How ironic for Satan, then, that this very contrast between glory and darkness helps Moses recognize Satan. Had Moses not experienced God’s glory, the darkness would have been less obvious. But Moses remembers, so he asks Lucifer:</p>
<p><i>And where is</i> thy <i>glory, that I should worship</i> thee?</p>
<p><i>For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me. . . . But I can look upon thee in the natural man. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Thy glory . . . is darkness unto me[.] And</i> I can judge between thee and God. [Moses 1:13–15; emphasis added]</p>
<p>What empowering words!</p>
<p>All of you have experienced some level of God’s glory. If not, you would not be here. And all of you have experienced some level of Satan’s darkness. In this you are no different from Moses either. So, like Moses, <i>you can judge!</i> You know the pain of your spirit being wounded by sin or the devastation of the Holy Ghost leaving when offended or the despair of losing self-control. But you also know the sweetness of forgiveness, the transcendence of testimony, and the humble gratitude for answered prayers. You have felt the love of the Lord in your life; you have felt His glory. This is why <i>you</i> can judge between glory and darkness, between God and Lucifer!</p>
<h2><b>Banishing Satan</b></h2>
<p>Knowing that God is completely honest (see Deuteronomy 32:4), Moses also knows that Satan is deceitful. Thus Moses doesn’t invite the father of lies to stay for lunch so as not to offend him. No, Moses cuts right to the chase: “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not” (Moses 1:16).</p>
<p>This is a powerful command—but not too powerful for a son or daughter of God to make! You, too, are a child of God. And you, too, can say, “Get thee hence, Satan.” In fact, there will be times you will <i>have</i> to say it.</p>
<p>Moses is strengthened by knowing his divine birthright and thus declared an unwavering commitment to Heavenly Father. He reminds Satan that</p>
<p><i>God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.</i></p>
<p><i>And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship</i> me. [Moses 1:16–17; emphasis added]</p>
<p>In other words, Moses is going to honor his covenants. He reiterates his commitment, saying:</p>
<p><i>I will</i> not <i>cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan.</i> [Moses 1:18; emphasis added]</p>
<p>You see this pattern again and again. Moses has seen God’s glory (or felt the love of the Lord in his life), he remembers it—his judgment is not impaired by Satan’s deceptions—and thus he can cast Satan out with confidence. Make this your pattern, too.</p>
<p>Further, if a man of Moses’ stature and testimony is still humble enough to realize that he cannot cease to call upon God, what does that mean for you? Brothers and sisters, at all times and in all places—but especially in the face of great trials and tribulations—<i>you cannot give up praying to Heavenly Father! </i>You must just keep trying, even if the heavens seem sealed and silent.</p>
<p>President Hinckley said, “We must get on our knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction.” <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>So after Moses commands Satan to leave, “Satan crie[s] with a loud voice, and rant[s] upon the earth, and command[s,] saying: <i>I</i> am the Only Begotten, worship me” (Moses 1:19; emphasis added). That is a lie, plain and simple. Lucifer is forever trying to be someone he’s not.</p>
<h2><b>Faith and Fear</b></h2>
<p>Lucifer’s exit must have exceeded anything Moses had ever witnessed, because “Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell” (Moses 1:20).</p>
<p>Verse 20 is crucial to remember because it shows us that Satan does not give up easily, or go quietly. He might preach instant gratification and self-indulgence, but he knows the power of patience and self-denial. Why else is he called the “cunning one” (2 Nephi 9:39)? Thus, Satan’s fury can strike fear into the hearts of men, even men like Moses—and like you. That is a scary thought, because as soon as Moses became afraid, he could see into the very depths of hell. But did you know that fear can overcome faith? All of us have times of fear—remember Peter walking on the water?</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught a most extraordinary truth:</p>
<p><i>For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the same time; so that persons whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is not there faith is weak; and where faith is weak the persons will not be able to contend against all the opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will have power over them and destroy them.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Jesus told Peter: “Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, <i>that thy faith fail not” </i>(Luke 22:31–32; emphasis added). Jesus knew that faith—not fear—will conquer Satan.</p>
<p>It is fear that overtakes Moses. But his fear does not last long enough to give Satan any advantage. Do you know why? Look at verse 20 again:</p>
<p><i>Nevertheless,</i> calling upon God, he received strength, <i>and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . And he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses.</i> [Moses 1:20, 22; emphasis added]</p>
<h2><b>Binding Satan</b></h2>
<p>What did Moses, the great prophet, do to escape his fear? He had no secret weapon that you don’t have. He prayed. He needed that divine assistance because Satan is persistent. It takes Moses <i>four </i>times to drive Satan out. Four times! (Even my sons usually minded after three times—well, most of the time.) Imagine if Moses had given up after three times.</p>
<p>In your deepest times of temptation and fear, like Moses, you must <i>plead with Heavenly Father as frequently and as long as necessary</i> to retain your faith. If you do not, Lucifer will lurk nearby until your defenses drop—and then return with enticings to worship him and fears to stop your heart. It is not easy—but nothing of worth is.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years ago Elder Eldred G. Smith gave some wonderful counsel about standing up to Lucifer:</p>
<p><i>The only power I know of that will bind Satan, or render him powerless, is righteous living.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Even Jesus Christ had to bind Satan when he was tempted in the wilderness. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>When you have resisted a temptation until it no longer becomes a temptation, then to that extent, Satan has lost his power over you, and as long as you do not yield to him, to that degree he is bound.</i><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>With Satan finally gone, “Moses lift[s] up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son” (Moses 1:24).</p>
<p>You have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost, who testifies of the truth. You are entitled to His presence and direction according to your faithfulness. Let Him help you!</p>
<h2><b>The Rewards of Faithfulness</b></h2>
<p>“ And calling upon the name of God, he [Moses] beh[olds] his glory again, for it [is] upon him” (Moses 1:25). Did you notice that Heavenly Father’s glory has returned?</p>
<p>Continuing in verse 25, Heavenly Father begins pouring out blessings upon Moses to reward his loyalty. God’s first words are ones of comfort and encouragement: “Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have <i>chosen </i>thee” (emphasis added). Being chosen by God is no small thing. Do you remember why many are called but few are chosen? Satan had offered Moses the worldly menu, but Moses denied himself “of <i>all</i> ungodliness” (Moroni 10:32; emphasis added). Thus Moses is chosen because his heart is set upon the things of his Father.</p>
<p>And now, after that crucible of temptation, God knows Moses can be trusted completely, and—just as important—<i>Moses</i> knows he is completely trustworthy. So Heavenly Father is able to further reward Moses with increased knowledge about his mission. Listen:</p>
<p><i>And thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God.</i></p>
<p><i>And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from bondage, even Israel my chosen.</i> [Moses 1:25–26]</p>
<p>What great promises! Can you hear the foreshadowing of “all that my Father hath shall be given unto [you]” (D&amp;C 84:38)?</p>
<h2><b><i>Whose</i> We Are</b></h2>
<p>Heavenly Father proceeds to reveal His innumerable creations and answer Moses’ questions about those creations. And then Heavenly Father says something that even though I cannot comprehend it, I know to be true: “For behold, there are many worlds. . . . And innumerable are they unto man; but <i>all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine </i>and <i>I know them” </i> (Moses 1:35; emphasis added).</p>
<p>Can you believe it? Even with all those innumerable creations, God knows Moses. And I testify that He also knows <i>you.</i> How do I know? Because He knows <i>me.</i> Because He has inspired my words for you tonight. We are numbered to Him because <i>we are His.</i></p>
<p>My counselor and dear friend, Anne C. Pingree, made a wonderful observation that not only are we “blessed to know who we are,” we are blessed to know “<i>whose</i> we are.” <sup>14</sup></p>
<h2><b>The Great Reward</b></h2>
<p>Moses had been taught who he was, he had been given his work, and he had been shown whose he was. And then, because he had proven himself unshakable, he was ready to learn Heavenly Father’s work and glory. From this seemingly simple revelation in Moses 1, the gospel and everything we do in it is unified and infused with eternal significance. Here is that stunning revelation in verse 39: “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”</p>
<p>This sublime statement is the crowning reward for Moses’ faithfulness and steadfastness. Its insight extends to us, changing our actions. It is a perfect example of how knowing leads to doing.</p>
<p>But remember that this pearl of great price came at a great price. It was received only <i>after </i>Moses had removed himself from the things of this world, had experienced divine love and glory, had learned who he was and what his work would be, had made covenants with his Father in Heaven, and had resisted Satan unceasingly with testimony and prayer.</p>
<p>Some of you may be struggling with knowing who you are. There’s a little secret about “to know is to do” : the flip side is also true—” to <i>do</i> is to <i>know!” </i> In other words, if you’re unsure, just do anyway. Jesus has promised, “If any man will <i>do</i> [my Father’s] will, he shall <i>know</i> of the doctrine, whether it be of God” (John 7:17; emphasis added). Do, and you’ll know.</p>
<h2><b>Remember Who You Are!</b></h2>
<p>Like Moses, you are a son or daughter of God in the similitude of His Only Begotten Son. Like Moses, you can do every single one of these things! And, therefore, like Moses, you can receive every single one of these incredible blessings.</p>
<p>Listen to the words Peter taught, referring to promises the Savior had made to others: “For the promise is unto <i>you,</i> and to <i>your children,</i> and to all that are afar off” (Acts 2:39; emphasis added).</p>
<p>And so this is why I tell my children and my grandchildren and each one of you, “Remember who you are.” Or, as the Lord said, “Remember the worth of souls is great” (D&amp;C 18:10).</p>
<p>This is why I say, “To know is to do.” Or, as the Savior said—and I like what was added—” If ye know these things, happy are ye <i>if ye do them” </i> (John 13:17; emphasis added).</p>
<p>I hope you feel energized and, as my boys say, “pumped up” to overcome the challenges that are uniquely yours for this unique time. You can conquer!</p>
<p>When you feel down, remember, you don’t have to do it alone. Many, like Moses, have gone before you and have successfully overcome hard things. You can too. Many—like President Hinckley, the Apostles, your bishop, your parents, and even I—pray for you daily. You can, and you must, pray too. You are children of God, and He has sent you here! His work and His glory is to bring to pass <i>your</i> immortality and eternal life.</p>
<p>Recently President Hinckley gave us wonderful encouragement:</p>
<p>[You] <i>must not give up.</i> [You] <i>must not become discouraged.</i> [You] <i>must never surrender to the forces of evil.</i> [You] <i>can and must maintain the standards for which this Church has stood since it was organized. There is a better way than the way of the world.</i> If it means standing alone, [you] must do it. . . .</p>
<p>. . . [You] <i>must get on</i> [your] <i>knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction.</i> [You] <i>must then stand on</i> [your] <i>feet and move forward.</i></p>
<p><i>I am absolutely confident that heaven will smile upon</i> [you]. <i>The Lord will hear and answer</i> [your] <i>prayers if</i> [you] <i>will commit</i> [yourself], <i>giving</i> [your] <i>very best to this work.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Moses showed us that this is true.</p>
<p>Tonight as you run out the door to life’s adventures, let me give you two Bonnie-isms for the road. They are filled with all the love in my heart: <i>Remember who you are. To know is to do!</i></p>
<p>I pray that you, like your brother Moses, will let Heavenly Father lead you, guide you, and walk beside you, because I testify that He will. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I join Peggy in welcoming you to the new school year. For some of you, including an unprecedented number of returned missionaries, this will be your first semester as full-time students at BYU. Others are back for another round. For all, it is a wonderful time of new opportunities, challenges, and, we hope, optimism. As Peggy mentioned, the women’s volleyball and soccer teams are both ranked nationally. The men’s and women’s cross-­country teams both won their first meets. And this past weekend the football team demonstrated that Book of Mormon scriptures apply to our times. Read Moroni 7:29 before you watch the replay of that last play.
Peggy next mentioned Laman and Lemuel in her talk. Several years ago, while reading the Book of Mormon, it dawned on me that I had probably been too hard on Laman and Lemuel. Or, more accurately, I realized, to my chagrin, that at times I had been more like them than I cared to admit. While we tend to think of Laman and Lemuel as disobedient rebels who never did anything right, the narrative from their perspective would probably have been much different. My guess is that for much of their lives, Laman and Lemuel considered themselves active members of the Church, doing the things that they were asked to do, even the hard things.
Think about it. When their father asked them to leave behind their riches, abandon their friends, and go out into the wilderness, did they go? Yes.1
When their father asked them to return to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban—not an easy task—did they go? Yes.2
When their father asked them to return again to get Ishmael and his family, they complied.3
When their brother asked them to help build a boat, even though he had no prior experience in such an endeavor, did they help? Eventually.4
And when they were instructed to get on that boat—to trust their lives and those of their families to a craft that had not only not been tested for seaworthiness but had also not been built in the normal manner—were they willing to trust their leaders and follow their instruction? Absolutely.5
Given this outward obedience, in my mind’s eye I can see Laman and Lemuel responding to their father’s repeated entreaties to be obedient by saying, “We have done everything you have asked us to do. What more do you want?”
What Lehi wanted from his sons, and what God wants from us, is not just outward physical compliance but also inward spiritual commitment. He wants not just our acts but our hearts, minds, and souls. And if we don’t give those to Him, eventually things will go wrong, as the experiences of Laman and Lemuel demonstrate.
In one sense, what separated Laman and Lemuel from Nephi was not so much their outward actions—although at critical times there were significant and telling differences in their actions, as Peggy has pointed out—but ra</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters. I appreciate this opportunity to add my welcome to all gathered today as we begin the new fall semester. It is a season of anticipation, planning, excitement, and perhaps even a little trepidation for those adjusting to all that goes on in this special place. We are very glad that you have chosen BYU and are qualified to be here.
At Brigham Young University we must always remember, reflect upon, and recall our fundamental purposes for being at this unique institution. As the semester progresses, all of us will likely be increasingly consumed with the demands and details of our daily tasks, which, at least superficially, are similar to or even much the same as we would encounter at another serious university. If we are not careful, papers, presentations, examinations, and other expectations will crowd out the higher or greater purposes for which BYU was established and the reasons for which we each decided to come and devote our time and energy.
Over the years I and many others have spoken at length and in some detail about the Aims of a BYU Education. I hope and expect we will continue to do so. I think virtually everyone seriously committed to BYU and our view of education will be able to recite without difficulty the expected outcomes of the BYU experience, which are that it should be spiritually strengthening, intellectually enlarging, and character building, and then leading to a lifetime of learning and service.
Without apology, I recognize that I have frequently emphasized the spiritually strengthening aspect of our efforts because it is unique in the world of higher education. Likewise, I have taken seriously and publicly the charge from our prophet leaders to make sure our academic and intellectual pursuits are of the highest order and quality. In addition, it is my perception that in our devotional services we are frequently reminded of the responsibilities and opportunities to provide meaningful service now and in the future. I continue to endorse and commend these initiatives and efforts.
Today I wish to focus my remarks on the importance of our individual character and on what we need to do to build and strengthen it as envisioned by the Savior and His duly selected prophet leaders. There are many definitions of character, but one simple idea articulated by someone long ago seems most satisfactory to me: “A man’s reputation is the opinion people have of him. His character is what he [or she] really is” (Jack Miner).
I hope in our time together this morning we can think carefully and seriously about what we really are and, more important, what we desire and need to become. I am satisfied that this aim of a BYU education—to build character—cannot be neglected or diminished because all of the aims and the mission of this great university are so intimately related to one another.
While growing up I remember the rather constant counsel from parents, </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I’m grateful for this invitation to speak at devotional today. Devotionals have always been a part of Brigham Young University campus life. They were first instituted by Karl G. Maeser and early on were offered on a daily basis. By the 1920s, devotionals were held three times a week. Although the number of devotionals per week has changed over the history of the university, their importance to the campus community has remained constant. Karl G. Maesar’s term as president ended in the 1880s, so we know it has been at least that long that these devotionals have been a traditional part of our campus.
Some years ago I was in a meeting with former academic vice president John Tanner. We were discussing some matters when the devotional became part of the conversation. Vice President Tanner mentioned the importance of the BYU devotional as one of the few experiences on campus we do as a community—what a rich tradition and one that brings us together in body and spirit.
Traditions have the ability to bind us generationally. Most often we associate traditions with holidays and celebrations. But they can simply be the handing down of statements, beliefs, legends, customs, and information that moves from generation to generation. This can happen by word of mouth or by practice. Defining the word tradition varies by academic disciplines. I’m simply going to define it here broadly for discussion purposes. For my purpose it will encompass the idea of continued accepted norms, patterns, or customs.
My wife, Gwen, and I recently returned from New Zealand. She spent her teenage years growing up in Wellington. We accompanied other members of her family who were returning back home to New Zealand for the first time in over thirty years. Near the end of our trip, we were making our way from the Bay of Plenty area toward Auckland. En route we planned on attending church in the City of Tauranga. There was no particular reason for selecting this place other than it was halfway between our two destinations. While we were attending the Tauranga Ward, we met a Brother Tata, who invited us to follow him after church to a neighborhood within the city. We followed him to the gates of a Maori marae. A marae is a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Maori culture. It doesn’t have to be a building; it can be an open space. To the Maori, the marae is a place just as important to them as their homes.
Brother Tata invited us through the gates and into a courtyard. After a brief moment there, we walked over to the building, took off our shoes, and were invited in. We partook of a ceremony, much of which was spoken in Maori. He then explained to us that, as a young missionary and future apostle, Matthew Cowley began his mission at the location of this marae. He told us that David O. McKay had come to this marae when the New Zealand Temple was dedicated and had brought other General Authorities with hi</span>

As I have prayed about what I might say to you this morning, I have felt that the most valuable thing I could say, above all else, would be to testify to you that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, love you with a perfect, infinite, and enduring love.1 There are many things that I confess I don’t know, but I know this to be true. I also know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is exactly what it claims to be. I know that, as Joseph Smith said, “The Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”2
Brothers and sisters, I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior, my Redeemer, and my Advocate with my Heavenly Father. I know that as I am eager to be taught and to repent—willing to change and to strive to become like a little child—my sins can be forgiven. I know that because of His Atonement, when I come unto Him, my heart can be changed. I love Him, and I am grateful, more than I can ever find words to describe, for all that He has done for me.
The Christian world is about to celebrate the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and, knowing what we know, we ought to be the best Christians in the world in how we treat each other. I believe with all of my heart that if our Savior Jesus Christ were to walk into this room this morning amongst us here, the two most significant characteristics we would observe and feel about Him would be His overwhelming glory and His perfect love for us—each and every one of us, individually!
Brothers and sisters, I know that the Church is true. It is all that it claims to be. It really is true! I am grateful that my Heavenly Father has given me this testimony, and I feel an obligation to share it whenever I have the opportunity. I have found that sharing my testimony is one of the greatest privileges of my life. I have found, as President Boyd K. Packer has taught us, that “as you give that which you have, there is a replacement, with increase!”3
As I have felt impressed that sharing my testimony would be the most valuable thing I could do this morning, I have also felt impressed to ask you a personal question. May I do that?
Have you ever thought carefully and deeply about what you really want to be when you grow up? It doesn’t matter whether you have chosen to be an engineer, economist, psychologist, physician, physicist, sociologist, scientist, printer, plumber, philosopher, or whatever. All of these professions can be wonderful in blessing the lives of others and can bring you great fulfillment when done well. But what </span>
