  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Elder Scott, President Samuelson, faculty, staff, parents, and graduates, it is a privilege and honor to be with you, as assigned by the First Presidency and the board of trustees. It is a joy to be here today.

I am grateful for the honorary doctoral degree bestowed upon me. What a wonderful privilege it is to be at a university that recognizes and honors Christian service!

Today many of you are to be honored for graduating. That is why we have come together: to honor you and this institution. This is a day to rejoice, a day to express gratitude to your parents, family members, teachers, and especially your Father in Heaven. It is a day to acknowledge the divinely inspired purpose of BYU and to thank members of the Church who support and sustain this university by faithful payment of their tithes. Most of all, it is a day to commend you.

You have kept the commandment to

&lt;i&gt;be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God . . . ;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79]

Recent events in these countries and kingdoms throughout the world tell us that we are living in the last days. The increasing “perplexities of the nations” recall the words of our Savior, Jesus Christ: “Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars. . . . For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom” (Matthew 24:6–7).

It is a challenging but exciting time. The gospel is rolling forth as a stone cut out of a mountain without hands. It is filling the earth. And now it is your privilege to help move this great work forward.

Not very long ago you entered this university to learn. By and large you have been successful in the world of school. But today you walk out the doors of this Marriott Center into another world. The question is: How can you be &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the world but not &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; the world?

As you go forth to serve, you will find that your greatest success and influence won’t come solely from the knowledge you have gained. It will come from what you do with that knowledge—the wise use of agency to make sound decisions.

In the next 10 years you will make some of the most important decisions of your life. Those decisions will be regarding
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;temple worthiness and covenants;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;choosing an eternal companion and, for those who have already made that choice, making the companionship work;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;beginning your family;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;beginning a life of service and callings in the Church;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;choosing where you will live;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;choosing who your employer will be;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;choosing where you will work; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;choosing how you will conduct yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Indeed, a decade of decision lies ahead. Of course there are some decisions that must wait until circumstances change and your understanding develops, but many of your most important decisions can and should be made now.

For example, you can decide the principles or axioms that will influence your decision making in the future. With this in mind, and with your permission, President Samuelson, I’d like to add a new degree to those who are graduating from BYU today: the LLBA or “living life by axioms” degree.

Here are 10 of these axioms, distilled from my own experience in living the gospel and living life. I hope they will be helpful to you in determining the principles that may guide your life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It is not the obstacle that counts but how you overcome it.&lt;/i&gt;

Consider, for a moment, that you are the engineer of a train. As your locomotive races down the tracks, you look out the window. In the distance you see a great pile of debris blocking your way. What do you do?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;You can radio ahead for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;You can stop the train and take care of the problem yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;You can pour coal into the burner and let the engine plow through the trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Now it’s axiomatic that we will all encounter obstacles in our lives. Temporal obstacles make eternal development possible. So you must decide how to meet those obstacles. Like the engineer, you can call for help. Through prayer, fasting, and diligent study you can obtain the assistance of your Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost. The Lord will comfort us, strengthen us, and enlighten us by His Holy Spirit. Often He will give us inspired counsel through parents and priesthood leaders.

Sometimes He will smooth our path by removing the obstacle. Sometimes, like a switchman, He will help us get on a different track. But from time to time the only way to clear debris from the track is to stop the train and take care of the problem. This is always true when the obstacles are of our own making, such as when we violate the Lord’s commandments. Repentance is the only way to clear the debris of sin and move forward in our lives. “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them” (D&amp;amp;C 58:43).

Finally, there are times when Heavenly Father directs us to pour on the spiritual coal. With faith and hope we must plow ahead—or, to use the more scriptural phrase, “press forward”:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 31:20]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Pursue your goals with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. You are doomed to failure if you pursue them in a vacillating manner.&lt;/i&gt;

So often we are tentative and don’t move forward with conviction. We feel along our way as if we were afraid in the dark. It is so much better to turn on the light of faith and move ahead with energy and commitment. If our course is wrong, we will quickly recognize it and make the necessary adjustments. But if we pursue a course tentatively and indecisively, it is difficult to know whether it is right or wrong in time to correct it and make a difference. The Lord said, “I would thou wert cold or hot” (Revelation 3:15). I hope we choose being active and being hot. We should decide now to make our decisions prayerfully and then move forward with faith, energy, and determination. As one novelist said, “If you’re going to have steam in the kettle, you’ve got to have a fire in the stove” (Louis L’Amour).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;From a tiny spark can come a great conflagration.&lt;/i&gt;

In the course of moving forward, it is normal to generate a few sparks. Misunderstandings, differences of opinion, and diverse personalities and styles can produce friction. Remember, if we are not careful, little things can easily become big things. Decide now to extinguish the sparks of conflict by thinking well of others and being kind to others. As the Lord taught, “Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him” (3 Nephi 12:25).

Don’t criticize. Don’t murmur. What you say about others may—and usually does—get back to them. See the good in people and develop that goodness through your own unwavering friendship, acceptance, loyalty, trust, and love.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Our greatest strengths can become our greatest weaknesses.&lt;/i&gt;

At this university you have prepared well to successfully complete your assignments. You have studied, memorized, and conceptualized to please your professors, pass your exams, and complete your courses. You have become very good at schoolwork. Your ability has been a great strength to you, but if you are not careful it can also become a great weakness. Use the gifts that have been given to you and do not rely solely on the abilities that you have developed at the university. When not properly balanced, the skills you have gained can be very self-serving, and, in the world outside the university, they can become very limiting.

For instance, you may know how to write a good paper, but if you cannot get along with other people, you may fail. You must now apply the knowledge you have gained to strengthen the Church, your family, your work, the community, and your friendships. Our greatest strengths can become weaknesses to us whenever we forget that our gifts, talents, and intellect are given to us by God and whenever we rely on the natural man and forget that God is the giver of all the gifts of life.

If we would keep our strengths from turning to weaknesses, we must “confess . . . his hand in all things, and obey . . . his commandments” (D&amp;amp;C 59:21).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Failure is one of the greatest teachers we have, if we have the faith to learn from it.&lt;/i&gt;

The Savior said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation” (John 16:33). But because He has “overcome the world,” we can “be of good cheer”—no failure is permanent (John 16:33). Therefore we should embrace the opportunity to learn from our mistakes, analyze where we could have done better, and make plans to improve. In doing so we will discover that setbacks and disappointments are, as Joseph Smith was told, “but for a small moment” and “shall be for [our] good” (D&amp;amp;C 122:4, 7; see also D&amp;amp;C 121:7).

With faith we can take seriously the Lord’s counsel to “search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for [our] good” (D&amp;amp;C 90:24).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It is not how you start the race or where you are during the race—it is how you cross the finish line that is going to matter.&lt;/i&gt;

John Stephen Akhwari, a marathon runner from Tanzania, competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics. As he was suffering along the way from fatigue, leg cramps, dehydration, and disorientation, “a voice called from within to go on, and so he went on” (&lt;i&gt;The Last African Runner,&lt;/i&gt; Olympiad Series, written, directed, and produced by Bud Greenspan, Cappy Productions, 1976, videocassette). Exhausted and staggering, John Stephen Akhwari was the last man to enter the stadium, more than an hour after the winner of the marathon had completed the race. When asked why he would complete a race he could never win, Akhwari replied, “My country did not send me 5,000 miles to &lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt; the race; my country sent me to &lt;i&gt;finish&lt;/i&gt; the race.”

We are not brought to earth just to be born into mortality. We came with a mission and a purpose—and that is to endure to the end.

Remember the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. All of them served the Master, and all received an equal wage. It did not matter that some arrived after others—only that each one finally came and endured.

Don’t let missteps of your youth discourage or overcome you. The Lord’s judgments are not spiritual GPAs with past sins and mistakes averaged into a final grade. He has promised that “he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).

So if you are not where you want to be, decide today to get there. Our lifetime degrees will be graded on how well we live the commandments and how well we have fulfilled our saving ordinances—baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, washings, anointings, endowments, and a sacred sealing in the temple to an eternal companion.

You can cross the finish line. “Go forward and not backward. Courage, . . . and on, on to the victory!” (D&amp;amp;C 128:22).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Borrowed from Brigham Young: &lt;i&gt;“If you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money; but it takes a wise man to save and dispose of it to his own advantage” (&lt;/i&gt;JD&lt;i&gt; 11:301).&lt;/i&gt;

It is to our advantage to cultivate genuine happiness in our lives. Joseph Smith taught that this “happiness is the object and design of our existence” (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 5:134). Unfortunately we live in an age of greed—one in which many suffer from an insatiable, enslaving appetite for temporal things.

Remember, &lt;i&gt;temporal&lt;/i&gt; means “temporary.” And temporary things we cannot bring with us for eternal happiness. So look forward. Take the eternal perspective. Be patient. Pay your tithes and offerings and save your money. Freely give of your offerings. Do not try to have now what it took your parents years of patient saving to acquire. Happy is the individual who can live within his means today and enjoy it.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You cannot learn the Lord’s will without exercising your agency and becoming accountable for your decisions.&lt;/i&gt;

Too often we think that with little or no effort on our part, the Holy Ghost will give us answers to our questions. Like Oliver Cowdery, we take “no thought save it [be] to ask” (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). And, regrettably, sometimes we don’t even pray. But this is not the way of the Lord. He has commanded us to “study it out in [our] mind[s]; [and] &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; . . . ask [Him] if it be right” (D&amp;amp;C 9:8, emphasis added).

For example, when choosing an eternal companion, we do not present a list of names to the Lord and ask Him to decide. Instead, we exercise our agency by participating in dating experiences. We get to know another person’s inner attitudes and outward behavior. Then we make a decision and take it to the Lord. In this way we become accountable for our decisions and responsible to prayerfully resolve any challenges that may arise.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A new interpretation of the old French proverb: &lt;i&gt;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&lt;/i&gt;

In 1975 I stood at this podium and held up my left hand. “We are here,” I said, with my left hand representing the Church. I then held up my right hand. “And the world is here and is moving farther and farther away.” At that time I imagined the world moving its way outside the building, past Brigham City and Logan and into Idaho. “But,” referring to my stationary left hand, “the Church is still here,” I said. That was 28 years ago.

Today the world is a great deal farther away than that. From my perspective, I’d put it in Australia—maybe farther. But my left hand is in the same stationary position. The Church is still here and will remain here.

As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you should expect to be different from your peers in the world. You should expect the distance to increase. Many want to have the Church just stay a little behind where the world is and keep moving with it. That is not the way the Lord would have it. As we come to the last days, we need to stand firm and say, “Don’t be dismayed.”

Those with eyes to see will recognize you as the light on the hill. They will seek you out because you know where to find the light in the darkness of these latter days—which leads me to the final axiom for today.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axiom 10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The temple of God is the greatest university.&lt;/i&gt;

The knowledge of the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the most valuable knowledge you will ever possess, and the endowment is the eternal curriculum. It teaches us where we came from and why we are here on earth. In the Lord’s holy house we are given the promise of achieving life eternal in the celestial kingdom if we obey the commandments and covenants. Go to the temple.

With these 10 axioms in mind, I want to bear a personal testimony to you and give you a promise.

In striving to be a successful son or daughter of God, you never have to compromise the things of the kingdom. Wherever your divinely appointed mission takes you, wherever your life is concerned, you will never be penalized for living the gospel. However, if for your own temporal gains you compromise God’s eternal principles, you will lose the eternal blessings that are rightfully yours.

As a New York boy, I grew up as one of only two or three members of the Church in a high school of several thousand. At a recent 50-year reunion, my former classmates remembered and expressed appreciation for how I had lived according to the values and beliefs of the Church. I realized then that one infraction of the Word of Wisdom or transgression of moral values would have meant I could never have said, “This is what I believe,” and be trusted by my friends.

We can only share the gospel to the extent we live it.

During my life at college, in the military as an adjutant and fighter pilot, in graduate school, or in my professional career—in sales and marketing, as president of a division, or as group vice president at the corporate headquarters—I was never required to compromise my values or beliefs.

Was it easy? I don’t know. I wasn’t looking for easy.

Was it hard? I wasn’t looking for hard either. That is just the way it was and the way you will find it in your life, too.

Were there men and women who challenged me about my beliefs at times? Certainly.

When I held to my beliefs, did they respect and honor the commitment I had made to live the gospel? In every instance.

If you will remember who you are and act accordingly; if you will give your full effort to every calling, task, and assignment; if you will be true to the Savior’s name and worthy of His eternal blessings, being able to have a temple recommend and be worthy to take the sacrament each week—then you will always have the light of the Holy Ghost to be with you, to lead you, to guide you, and to buoy you up. You will never want for what to say or how to act. It will be given to you.

How you live, what you represent, how you treat your associates, and how you honor and revere your companion and your family will spread the influence of our Savior Jesus Christ to your friends and neighbors, for there is no greater Christian service than to become like Him, heed the counsel of His Spirit, and do His will.

As the years go by, you will discover many axioms that reflect your own experience of living the gospel. Learn them, live them in your life, and share them.

I leave with you my testimony of who we are: children of God with divine purpose.

I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. The restored gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come forth under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It has given us the way to eternal happiness and salvation.

President Hinckley—our prophet, seer, and revelator in these times—leads us and guides us.

May the Lord bless you and keep you. May you have a good life, may you become what you want to be, and may you fulfill your dreams now and return with honor in the eternities, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Elder Scott, President Samuelson, faculty, staff, parents, and graduates, it is a privilege and honor to be with you, as assigned by the First Presidency and the board of trustees. It is a joy to be here today.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the honorary doctoral degree bestowed upon me. What a wonderful privilege it is to be at a university that recognizes and honors Christian service!</p>
<p>Today many of you are to be honored for graduating. That is why we have come together: to honor you and this institution. This is a day to rejoice, a day to express gratitude to your parents, family members, teachers, and especially your Father in Heaven. It is a day to acknowledge the divinely inspired purpose of BYU and to thank members of the Church who support and sustain this university by faithful payment of their tithes. Most of all, it is a day to commend you.</p>
<p>You have kept the commandment to</p>
<p><i>be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God . . . ;</i></p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;C 88:78–79]</p>
<p>Recent events in these countries and kingdoms throughout the world tell us that we are living in the last days. The increasing “perplexities of the nations” recall the words of our Savior, Jesus Christ: “Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars. . . . For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom” (Matthew 24:6–7).</p>
<p>It is a challenging but exciting time. The gospel is rolling forth as a stone cut out of a mountain without hands. It is filling the earth. And now it is your privilege to help move this great work forward.</p>
<p>Not very long ago you entered this university to learn. By and large you have been successful in the world of school. But today you walk out the doors of this Marriott Center into another world. The question is: How can you be <i>in</i> the world but not <i>of</i> the world?</p>
<p>As you go forth to serve, you will find that your greatest success and influence won’t come solely from the knowledge you have gained. It will come from what you do with that knowledge—the wise use of agency to make sound decisions.</p>
<p>In the next 10 years you will make some of the most important decisions of your life. Those decisions will be regarding</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>temple worthiness and covenants;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>choosing an eternal companion and, for those who have already made that choice, making the companionship work;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>beginning your family;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>beginning a life of service and callings in the Church;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>choosing where you will live;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>choosing who your employer will be;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>choosing where you will work; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>choosing how you will conduct yourself.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, a decade of decision lies ahead. Of course there are some decisions that must wait until circumstances change and your understanding develops, but many of your most important decisions can and should be made now.</p>
<p>For example, you can decide the principles or axioms that will influence your decision making in the future. With this in mind, and with your permission, President Samuelson, I’d like to add a new degree to those who are graduating from BYU today: the LLBA or “living life by axioms” degree.</p>
<p>Here are 10 of these axioms, distilled from my own experience in living the gospel and living life. I hope they will be helpful to you in determining the principles that may guide your life.</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 1</b></h2>
<p><i>It is not the obstacle that counts but how you overcome it.</i></p>
<p>Consider, for a moment, that you are the engineer of a train. As your locomotive races down the tracks, you look out the window. In the distance you see a great pile of debris blocking your way. What do you do?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>You can radio ahead for help.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can stop the train and take care of the problem yourself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can pour coal into the burner and let the engine plow through the trouble.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Now it’s axiomatic that we will all encounter obstacles in our lives. Temporal obstacles make eternal development possible. So you must decide how to meet those obstacles. Like the engineer, you can call for help. Through prayer, fasting, and diligent study you can obtain the assistance of your Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost. The Lord will comfort us, strengthen us, and enlighten us by His Holy Spirit. Often He will give us inspired counsel through parents and priesthood leaders.</p>
<p>Sometimes He will smooth our path by removing the obstacle. Sometimes, like a switchman, He will help us get on a different track. But from time to time the only way to clear debris from the track is to stop the train and take care of the problem. This is always true when the obstacles are of our own making, such as when we violate the Lord’s commandments. Repentance is the only way to clear the debris of sin and move forward in our lives. “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them” (D&amp;C 58:43).</p>
<p>Finally, there are times when Heavenly Father directs us to pour on the spiritual coal. With faith and hope we must plow ahead—or, to use the more scriptural phrase, “press forward”:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i> [2 Nephi 31:20]</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 2</b></h2>
<p><i>Pursue your goals with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. You are doomed to failure if you pursue them in a vacillating manner.</i></p>
<p>So often we are tentative and don’t move forward with conviction. We feel along our way as if we were afraid in the dark. It is so much better to turn on the light of faith and move ahead with energy and commitment. If our course is wrong, we will quickly recognize it and make the necessary adjustments. But if we pursue a course tentatively and indecisively, it is difficult to know whether it is right or wrong in time to correct it and make a difference. The Lord said, “I would thou wert cold or hot” (Revelation 3:15). I hope we choose being active and being hot. We should decide now to make our decisions prayerfully and then move forward with faith, energy, and determination. As one novelist said, “If you’re going to have steam in the kettle, you’ve got to have a fire in the stove” (Louis L’Amour).</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 3</b></h2>
<p><i>From a tiny spark can come a great conflagration.</i></p>
<p>In the course of moving forward, it is normal to generate a few sparks. Misunderstandings, differences of opinion, and diverse personalities and styles can produce friction. Remember, if we are not careful, little things can easily become big things. Decide now to extinguish the sparks of conflict by thinking well of others and being kind to others. As the Lord taught, “Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him” (3 Nephi 12:25).</p>
<p>Don’t criticize. Don’t murmur. What you say about others may—and usually does—get back to them. See the good in people and develop that goodness through your own unwavering friendship, acceptance, loyalty, trust, and love.</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 4</b></h2>
<p><i>Our greatest strengths can become our greatest weaknesses.</i></p>
<p>At this university you have prepared well to successfully complete your assignments. You have studied, memorized, and conceptualized to please your professors, pass your exams, and complete your courses. You have become very good at schoolwork. Your ability has been a great strength to you, but if you are not careful it can also become a great weakness. Use the gifts that have been given to you and do not rely solely on the abilities that you have developed at the university. When not properly balanced, the skills you have gained can be very self-serving, and, in the world outside the university, they can become very limiting.</p>
<p>For instance, you may know how to write a good paper, but if you cannot get along with other people, you may fail. You must now apply the knowledge you have gained to strengthen the Church, your family, your work, the community, and your friendships. Our greatest strengths can become weaknesses to us whenever we forget that our gifts, talents, and intellect are given to us by God and whenever we rely on the natural man and forget that God is the giver of all the gifts of life.</p>
<p>If we would keep our strengths from turning to weaknesses, we must “confess . . . his hand in all things, and obey . . . his commandments” (D&amp;C 59:21).</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 5</b></h2>
<p><i>Failure is one of the greatest teachers we have, if we have the faith to learn from it.</i></p>
<p>The Savior said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation” (John 16:33). But because He has “overcome the world,” we can “be of good cheer”—no failure is permanent (John 16:33). Therefore we should embrace the opportunity to learn from our mistakes, analyze where we could have done better, and make plans to improve. In doing so we will discover that setbacks and disappointments are, as Joseph Smith was told, “but for a small moment” and “shall be for [our] good” (D&amp;C 122:4, 7; see also D&amp;C 121:7).</p>
<p>With faith we can take seriously the Lord’s counsel to “search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for [our] good” (D&amp;C 90:24).</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 6</b></h2>
<p><i>It is not how you start the race or where you are during the race—it is how you cross the finish line that is going to matter.</i></p>
<p>John Stephen Akhwari, a marathon runner from Tanzania, competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics. As he was suffering along the way from fatigue, leg cramps, dehydration, and disorientation, “a voice called from within to go on, and so he went on” (<i>The Last African Runner,</i> Olympiad Series, written, directed, and produced by Bud Greenspan, Cappy Productions, 1976, videocassette). Exhausted and staggering, John Stephen Akhwari was the last man to enter the stadium, more than an hour after the winner of the marathon had completed the race. When asked why he would complete a race he could never win, Akhwari replied, “My country did not send me 5,000 miles to <i>start</i> the race; my country sent me to <i>finish</i> the race.”</p>
<p>We are not brought to earth just to be born into mortality. We came with a mission and a purpose—and that is to endure to the end.</p>
<p>Remember the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. All of them served the Master, and all received an equal wage. It did not matter that some arrived after others—only that each one finally came and endured.</p>
<p>Don’t let missteps of your youth discourage or overcome you. The Lord’s judgments are not spiritual GPAs with past sins and mistakes averaged into a final grade. He has promised that “he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (D&amp;C 58:42).</p>
<p>So if you are not where you want to be, decide today to get there. Our lifetime degrees will be graded on how well we live the commandments and how well we have fulfilled our saving ordinances—baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, washings, anointings, endowments, and a sacred sealing in the temple to an eternal companion.</p>
<p>You can cross the finish line. “Go forward and not backward. Courage, . . . and on, on to the victory!” (D&amp;C 128:22).</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 7</b></h2>
<p>Borrowed from Brigham Young: <i>“If you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money; but it takes a wise man to save and dispose of it to his own advantage” (</i>JD<i> 11:301).</i></p>
<p>It is to our advantage to cultivate genuine happiness in our lives. Joseph Smith taught that this “happiness is the object and design of our existence” (<i>HC</i> 5:134). Unfortunately we live in an age of greed—one in which many suffer from an insatiable, enslaving appetite for temporal things.</p>
<p>Remember, <i>temporal</i> means “temporary.” And temporary things we cannot bring with us for eternal happiness. So look forward. Take the eternal perspective. Be patient. Pay your tithes and offerings and save your money. Freely give of your offerings. Do not try to have now what it took your parents years of patient saving to acquire. Happy is the individual who can live within his means today and enjoy it.</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 8</b></h2>
<p><i>You cannot learn the Lord’s will without exercising your agency and becoming accountable for your decisions.</i></p>
<p>Too often we think that with little or no effort on our part, the Holy Ghost will give us answers to our questions. Like Oliver Cowdery, we take “no thought save it [be] to ask” (D&amp;C 9:7). And, regrettably, sometimes we don’t even pray. But this is not the way of the Lord. He has commanded us to “study it out in [our] mind[s]; [and] <i>then</i> . . . ask [Him] if it be right” (D&amp;C 9:8, emphasis added).</p>
<p>For example, when choosing an eternal companion, we do not present a list of names to the Lord and ask Him to decide. Instead, we exercise our agency by participating in dating experiences. We get to know another person’s inner attitudes and outward behavior. Then we make a decision and take it to the Lord. In this way we become accountable for our decisions and responsible to prayerfully resolve any challenges that may arise.</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 9</b></h2>
<p>A new interpretation of the old French proverb: <i>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</i></p>
<p>In 1975 I stood at this podium and held up my left hand. “We are here,” I said, with my left hand representing the Church. I then held up my right hand. “And the world is here and is moving farther and farther away.” At that time I imagined the world moving its way outside the building, past Brigham City and Logan and into Idaho. “But,” referring to my stationary left hand, “the Church is still here,” I said. That was 28 years ago.</p>
<p>Today the world is a great deal farther away than that. From my perspective, I’d put it in Australia—maybe farther. But my left hand is in the same stationary position. The Church is still here and will remain here.</p>
<p>As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you should expect to be different from your peers in the world. You should expect the distance to increase. Many want to have the Church just stay a little behind where the world is and keep moving with it. That is not the way the Lord would have it. As we come to the last days, we need to stand firm and say, “Don’t be dismayed.”</p>
<p>Those with eyes to see will recognize you as the light on the hill. They will seek you out because you know where to find the light in the darkness of these latter days—which leads me to the final axiom for today.</p>
<h2><b>Axiom 10</b></h2>
<p><i>The temple of God is the greatest university.</i></p>
<p>The knowledge of the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the most valuable knowledge you will ever possess, and the endowment is the eternal curriculum. It teaches us where we came from and why we are here on earth. In the Lord’s holy house we are given the promise of achieving life eternal in the celestial kingdom if we obey the commandments and covenants. Go to the temple.</p>
<p>With these 10 axioms in mind, I want to bear a personal testimony to you and give you a promise.</p>
<p>In striving to be a successful son or daughter of God, you never have to compromise the things of the kingdom. Wherever your divinely appointed mission takes you, wherever your life is concerned, you will never be penalized for living the gospel. However, if for your own temporal gains you compromise God’s eternal principles, you will lose the eternal blessings that are rightfully yours.</p>
<p>As a New York boy, I grew up as one of only two or three members of the Church in a high school of several thousand. At a recent 50-year reunion, my former classmates remembered and expressed appreciation for how I had lived according to the values and beliefs of the Church. I realized then that one infraction of the Word of Wisdom or transgression of moral values would have meant I could never have said, “This is what I believe,” and be trusted by my friends.</p>
<p>We can only share the gospel to the extent we live it.</p>
<p>During my life at college, in the military as an adjutant and fighter pilot, in graduate school, or in my professional career—in sales and marketing, as president of a division, or as group vice president at the corporate headquarters—I was never required to compromise my values or beliefs.</p>
<p>Was it easy? I don’t know. I wasn’t looking for easy.</p>
<p>Was it hard? I wasn’t looking for hard either. That is just the way it was and the way you will find it in your life, too.</p>
<p>Were there men and women who challenged me about my beliefs at times? Certainly.</p>
<p>When I held to my beliefs, did they respect and honor the commitment I had made to live the gospel? In every instance.</p>
<p>If you will remember who you are and act accordingly; if you will give your full effort to every calling, task, and assignment; if you will be true to the Savior’s name and worthy of His eternal blessings, being able to have a temple recommend and be worthy to take the sacrament each week—then you will always have the light of the Holy Ghost to be with you, to lead you, to guide you, and to buoy you up. You will never want for what to say or how to act. It will be given to you.</p>
<p>How you live, what you represent, how you treat your associates, and how you honor and revere your companion and your family will spread the influence of our Savior Jesus Christ to your friends and neighbors, for there is no greater Christian service than to become like Him, heed the counsel of His Spirit, and do His will.</p>
<p>As the years go by, you will discover many axioms that reflect your own experience of living the gospel. Learn them, live them in your life, and share them.</p>
<p>I leave with you my testimony of who we are: children of God with divine purpose.</p>
<p>I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. The restored gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come forth under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It has given us the way to eternal happiness and salvation.</p>
<p>President Hinckley—our prophet, seer, and revelator in these times—leads us and guides us.</p>
<p>May the Lord bless you and keep you. May you have a good life, may you become what you want to be, and may you fulfill your dreams now and return with honor in the eternities, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your ­family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on—and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy—one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of God’s plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch—choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.2
With this gift of time, you won’t always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what ­happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Deter­mine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We can’t refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, ­faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of “outstanding life and contribution to society and the world.”
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, “With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor.”
Then my daughter exclaimed, “What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!”
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xi’an Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, “Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well.” Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer—now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater—in Chinese, “the mother school.”
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, “As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them.”
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto “Go forth to serve” has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, “go forth to serve” could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of one’s undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you—graduates, parents, and other supporters—thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: “Wow! So how do those fit together?” In some ways they don’t. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests—like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life” (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn’t end, the quest doesn’t end, and our relationships don’t end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didn’t know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: “Believe in yourself as I believe in you.” It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together (“Believe in Yourself,” The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
