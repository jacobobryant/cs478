  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I appreciate that introduction given so you will know who I am. Recently I went to the welfare cannery with my ward to do pears. I sat by, and visited with, a nice woman from another stake. After about twenty minutes of conversation, she looked at me and said, “You remind me so much of Elaine Jack. Has anyone ever told you that before?” I said, “Actually, more people tell me I am like my sister” and then confessed I was Elaine Jack. I am glad to be here.

Every time I visit this campus I marvel at the enormous force for good you represent. You are the leaders who will shape this world for years to come. You are indeed being prepared for a most hazardous journey. I assure you that Elisha’s counsel to his young comrades as they faced what appeared to be overwhelming odds holds true today: “They that be with us are more than they that be with them” (2 Kings 6:16).

It is your journey ahead that I would like to address—the journey that will require careful planning and execution, wise use of your resources, and constant reliance on and dedication to eternal principles.

Nearly one hundred fifty years ago, a small band of settlers organized under George and Jacob Donner set out on a journey to a better life. At first their trek was typical of the scenes that had been played out time and again as pioneers made their way west to the rich lands of opportunity. But this was a misguided effort flawed by mistakes and misjudgments. Indeed, the Donner party was one of the most tragic dramas in the history of America.

The party included an assemblage of folks from Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, and Ohio. Of the ninety men, women, and children who began the trek, forty-two died; and those who lived struggled the rest of their lives with the effects of exposure, starvation, and wrenching memories. Their journey left an account for history that will never be forgotten.

The Donner party made their way to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, with little fanfare. But then they succumbed to the lure of a quicker, but unproven, route to California charted by a man named Lansford W. Hastings. Instead of the much-traveled course around the rugged Sierra mountains and then down to the California coast, the Donner party chose to go south through the Wasatch Mountains, down Echo Canyon, across the salt flats on the south side of the Great Salt Lake, and over the deserts of northern Nevada. They intended to clear the mountain pass near the present site of Reno, Nevada, before the snows fell.

Such was the outline for the journey, but they never made it. They got within one day of the last mountain pass before meeting with final disaster. What happened?

In May 1847, shortly after her rescue from the snowbound encampment near what is now Donner Lake, twelve-year-old survivor Virginia Reed wrote to her cousin in Illinois this message: “Never take no cutoffs and hurry along as fast as you can” (quoted in George R. Stewart, &lt;i&gt;Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party &lt;/i&gt;[Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1960], p. 361).

We can learn much from Virginia and the historical accounts of the ill-fated journey. Many of the settlers, not able to part with their material luxuries of home, brought an excess of possessions that slowed the progress of the entire company. Factions splintered the group into camps of “us” and “them.” Before the party reached the Sierras, one of the members had killed another.

The single worst factor was taking an unproven shortcut. When Virginia said, “Don’t take no shortcuts”, she knew what she was talking about. The Hastings Cutoff was supposed to save as much as 300 miles, but the path led into a blind canyon. What reportedly would take a week took thirty days. Things just got worse. The stretch across the salt flats was almost twice the distance indicated, not forty but seventy miles. They had too few provisions and too little water for themselves and their animals.

Finally, upon reaching the towering Sierra Nevada range, they rested. They squandered their last week of good weather gathering strength for the final days. Had they not stopped they would have been only a footnote in the history of the developing West. But it snowed.

The party was one day short of clearing the pass when early storms in late October buried them in snow depths of more than twenty feet. They built crude shelters of logs, rocks, and hides, and ate twigs, mice, their animals that did not run away, and then their own shoes. Finally, some of them resorted to eating the dead. Four rescue parties worked their way in from the west that winter and spring to save those who were miraculously still alive.

Today, I want you to look at your journey. There are several lessons to be learned from the Donner party that have nothing to do with wagon trains and everything to do with exaltation. For you, the stakes are higher than a home in the untamed West. Your destination is eternal glory.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson One: “Never Take No Cutoffs”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Donner party took a shortcut, an unproven one at that. Beverly Sills, a famous musician familiar with the rigor of working to get someplace has said, “There are no shortcuts to anyplace worth going.” She was right. To be marooned in the middle of the mountains was not the destination of the Donners.

Our journey is clearly defined, the path well marked, the pitfalls noted. But the Lord is wise. He knows he must prove us, for he says, “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves” (Matthew 10:16).

We are not only here to learn, we are here to test that learning. That phase of this earthly journey was outlined from the beginning, for the scriptures tell us, “Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (Luke 2:52). He learned, like you are learning in this great institution dedicated to bringing forth righteous leaders.

For the Donner party there was a proven trail. It was longer, but it was sure. Gambling on their own abilities and personal ambitions, they took a road that had never been tested. The result is history.

The Lord says, “Enter ye in at the strait gate: . . . Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it” (Matthew 7:13–14).

As you follow the path of the Savior, keeping your covenants and his commandments, you will be assaulted from all sides with offers to take other roads, other travel packages. Anything the adversary can do to pull you off course, he will do. He’ll stop at nothing to catch your attention, and then, ever so slyly, he will lead you away from the work of the Lord.

This is the dispensation of the fullness of times. We have been given the fullness of the gospel. To entice us from the path, Satan suggests a salad bar of sin—a little here and a little there until the plate is piled high and the price is paid. Knowing of his style and cunning, we must “press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 3:14).

There are some who are not satisfied with the peace that comes from the Lord. Seeking to find gratification in places other than in holy settings, they hang out—usually on a limb—and play into the hands of Satan and his evil designs. “Stand ye in holy places,” we are told, for the road back from sin is a long one (see D&amp;amp;C 87:8).

Some break what they view as the lesser commandments, hoping that these will only be minor deductions in the final exam. They don’t keep the Sabbath day holy, they invite temptation, they seek release from the pressures of school with drugs or alcohol, they don’t fulfill their callings. They lie—just a little; they cheat—just when they need to; and they miss church meetings—only when they’re tired.

“Never take no cutoffs” means to enter in at the strait gate, my brothers and sisters, and to stay on the strait and narrow path. Such devotion to the Lord’s cause is difficult. But know that just as the Donner party set off with the best of intentions, you too can be led into blind canyons and forced to cross treacherous desert sands when you have strayed.

In this audience are some of the best the Lord has on this earth. You are here at BYU as part of your prescribed journey. President Benson has counseled that “Intelligence, or light and truth, becomes a vital force in our eternal journey” (&lt;i&gt;TETB, &lt;/i&gt;p. 302).

This gathering of Saints is a sampling of the strength of the Lord’s force for righteousness in the last days. Does that give you pause? As a group you are capable of mighty works, but each of you must go forth on the journey as did Moroni, whose

&lt;i&gt;heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 48:12–13]

With such devotion there are no sidesteps, no missteps. My dear young friends, there are no shortcuts to eternity.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson Two: Travel Light&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the families in the Donner party was unable to leave behind their cherished personal belongings. They had a specially built wagon twice the size of a typical Conestoga to carry their treasures across the wilderness. But the wagon was slow, cumbersome, and difficult to maneuver. Ultimately it was abandoned on the salt flats as water and rations became far more valuable than tables and chairs.

Reflect on the counsel of the Savior to the young man who asked, “Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” The Savior listed all the basic commandments, then next we read:

&lt;i&gt;The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. &lt;/i&gt;[Matthew 19:16–22]

Are we willing to leave behind the world to become like God? Worldly comforts may temporarily minimize the impact of our struggles here on earth; they may give us comfort and a sense of importance, even a measure of success. But such reliance on material possessions deprives us of reliance upon our Heavenly Father and his saving grace. Our spiritual growth comes from seeing the Lord’s hand in our lives. There is little comparison between a worldly check register and our account in the Lamb’s book of life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson Three: Contention, Strife, Anger, and Derision Thwart Our Progress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Relationships with one another are sacred trusts. That’s why we call each other brother and sister. We are indeed the closest of companions on this journey. Respect, honor, love, and humility are the basics for living with the Father. To practice and refine these traits here is to be in touch with the eternities today.

Reading the Book of Mormon puts clearly in front of us the debilitating nature of contention. The prophet Jacob mourned the dissension rampant among the people. At the end of his life he wrote,

&lt;i&gt;I conclude this record . . . by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days. &lt;/i&gt;[Jacob 7:26]

Then we read of a happier people who had just been visited by the Savior. Wrote the prophet Nephi,

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. &lt;/i&gt;[4 Nephi 1:15–16]

Anger and friction delayed and divided the Donner party on their journey. Such discord led, in part, to their temporal tragedy. Satan loves dissension in any form. He encourages harsh feelings, angry words, ruthless judgments, scorn, pride, and the cruelest of actions.

Our greatest teacher and example on this point is Jesus Christ. To those unbelievers, those who wished him harm, those who plotted his capture and even his death, Jesus Christ showed mercy and compassion, charity and love that never wavered. No unkind words passed his lips. His behavior was always becoming of the King of Kings. What did the Lord say from the cross to those who jeered at him, spit upon him and called him names? “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34).

May we, too, forgive and love and honor each other on this journey.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson Four: “Hurry Along as Fast as You Can”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Donner party showed us the risks of taking our time. We have no time to lose—or even time to take it easy. I love the old Chinese saying, “Man who sit with legs crossed and mouth open waiting for roast duck to fly in have long hunger.”

We can’t sit. We can’t wait. The Donners waited, and the snows came, and their journey was a tragedy.

Recently, the administration here at BYU instituted a new policy to help students “hurry along” in their college training. This is not to deprive or limit an education, but instead it encourages you to focus on this season of your life. The new approach is designed to keep students from loading up on unneeded courses, encourages planning early, and increases the odds that a student will “graduate.” This is good advice applied to any task at any time. Such direction would have aided the Donners. It will reap benefits for you.

There is more to “hurrying along” than simply speeding up the system. We have to pace ourselves to get where we want to go. In the book of Joshua (24:15) we are told firmly, “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” When we look to this scripture we usually hear “choose” and “serve.” But notice it says “this day,” not tomorrow or the next day or when you finish your finals. It says, now. Right now. The Lord has told us, “I come quickly,” and he is a man of his word. We must be prepared.

This is not idle counsel. We read in Helaman 13:38, “Behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late.”

We cannot procrastinate our days of serving the Lord in his kingdom, or our daily reading of the scriptures until our class loads are lighter. Believe me, you are busy now; and it will never get better or easier. The load is always there, for the Lord is training you to lift and carry more and more. To sidestep such service is to miss opportunities in the kingdom that may not come again.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson Five: Sometimes We Need to Be Rescued&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Some of the members of the Donner party were saved only because of the timely rescue efforts of others, people who set aside their work and their personal safety to find those who were lost. Some of us in this room need rescuing—maybe some who aren’t here do too. And some of us are the rescuers. We aren’t being asked to strap on snow shoes and scale the west slope of the Sierras in the middle of winter; we are being asked to save souls, one person at a time. Remember, this is a spiritual journey, and this is the greatest work in the eyes of God.

I have a good friend who told me of a personal rescue that she holds close to her heart. She was a college student like you, but she attended that red-and-white institution to the north. (Some of you might think that was the source of her problems.) It was near the end of her senior year, and things were not falling together as she had hoped. She had applied to graduate school but wasn’t sure about taking that next step in her education. She was very involved in student affairs and recognized that these experiences that she loved were coming to an end. She was dating the missionary for whom she’d waited for two years, but she was also dating his best friend and had been for most of the time the missionary was gone. You get the picture. At that moment, her journey was a nightmare.

It was a Friday afternoon, and she was particularly downhearted. She hadn’t heard from any graduate schools. She was juggling dates for the weekend with both men. She had papers to write and projects to finish. Her little ten-year-old brother was the only one home, and he was begging her to play a game with him. She couldn’t stand to deal with life, so she left. She walked out the front door and up the street, and then she turned and began to walk toward the freeway. As she walked she heard a crunch on the gravel behind her, and turning she saw her little brother. He looked at her face streaked with tears and then asked, “Where ya going?”

She replied in a voice most dramatic, “I don’t know.”

For a minute he looked at her, not sure what to do, and then he said, “Do you want to go to Skaggs?”

He was a rescuer that day. A little ten-year-old chasing a lost-looking sister around the corner and up the street. He knew something was wrong, didn’t know what, and yet he was the only one there. He made her laugh, and they went to Skaggs. She’ll never forget that day he saved her. He more than made her day.

How long has it been since you’ve made someone’s day? Or made a very bad day just a little bit better? Sometimes climbing up on that white horse feels good for the rider as well as the one in distress.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Last Lesson: Journeys Are Packed with Troubles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Donner party had big troubles that crippled their course. All of us have obstacles and difficulties in our lives. But let me contrast the difference in the approach of the Donner party with that of a band of Mormon pioneers crossing the Atlantic. William Clayton sailed from England to America in 1840 with a host of new converts. You know his name, for he later wrote the classic hymn “Come, Come Ye Saints.” The words are a testimony of his understanding of adversity as part of the eternal plan. After arriving in Nauvoo, Clayton wrote home to his fellow Saints in England and said:

&lt;i&gt;We have sometimes almost suffocated with heat . . . sometimes almost froze with cold. We have had to sleep on boards instead of feathers, and on boxes which was worse. We have had our clothes wet through without the privilege of drying them or changing them. We have had to sleep out-of-doors in very severe weather. Don’t suppose for a moment that all will be peace and ease. . . . These are days of tribulation and we must endure our portion. &lt;/i&gt;[And then he continued,] &lt;i&gt;If you will be faithful you have nothing to fear from the journey. The Lord will take care of his saints. &lt;/i&gt;[William Clayton, letter from Commerce, 10 December 1840, Church Archives]

“Be faithful and you will have nothing to fear from the journey.” I testify to you today that this is true. Be faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the covenants you have made, and you will sing praises, “All is well.” I am not being simplistic when I say that our faith can carry us when we are weary, wounded, worn by the buffetings of the world, and wanting to go home. Faith can bring the journey of a lifetime. Look at Peter, who stepped off the boat to join Jesus. Peter stepped off because of his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He understood that with him all things are possible.

They are. I know this, and I promise you that such a testimony will come to you in your life as you exercise faith at the most trying of times.

The Lord loves you. Everyone of you is numbered, known, and loved by the Lord Jesus Christ. With such assurance, indeed, can’t we sing, “All is well”?

There are indeed reasons for our trials. Lorenzo Snow, fifth president of the Church, said, “You and I cannot be made perfect except through suffering: Jesus could not. In His prayer and agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, He foreshadowed the purifying process necessary . . . to secure the glory of a celestial kingdom” (10 January 1886, &lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 26:367).

That concept of Gethsemane speaks to my heart. We all face those monumental periods in our lives when we turn to the Lord and pour out our souls, for the pain is too great to stand alone. Know that this, too, is part of the process of perfection. Let me share with you a poem that makes this point so well:

&lt;i&gt;All those who journey, soon or late,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Must pass within the garden’s gate;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Must kneel alone in darkness there,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And battle with some fierce despair.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;God pity those who cannot say,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Not mine but thine,” who only pray,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Let this cup pass,” and cannot see&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The purpose in Gethsemane.&lt;/i&gt;
[Ella Wheeler Wilcox, “Gethsemane,” &lt;i&gt;Poetical Works of Ella Wheeler Wilcox &lt;/i&gt;(Edinburgh: W. P. Nimmo, Hay, &amp;amp; Mitchell, 1917), pp. 133–34]

This life is a spiritual journey. There are lessons to be learned. Virginia said, “Never take no shortcuts,” and she was wise. Shortcuts only deflect us from the narrow trail. Travel light, be kind to everyone, hear with your heart when someone needs you. Hold your head high amid troubles and find comfort in the cry “All is well.”

Time is short, my brothers and sisters, so “hurry along as fast as you can.” We can do this for we are some of the Lord’s most faithful Saints, and he is with us. He hears our prayers. He knows our needs. We have nothing to fear from the journey; we are on a well-marked path that leads home, all the way home to our Father in Heaven. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I appreciate that introduction given so you will know who I am. Recently I went to the welfare cannery with my ward to do pears. I sat by, and visited with, a nice woman from another stake. After about twenty minutes of conversation, she looked at me and said, “You remind me so much of Elaine Jack. Has anyone ever told you that before?” I said, “Actually, more people tell me I am like my sister” and then confessed I was Elaine Jack. I am glad to be here.</p>
<p>Every time I visit this campus I marvel at the enormous force for good you represent. You are the leaders who will shape this world for years to come. You are indeed being prepared for a most hazardous journey. I assure you that Elisha’s counsel to his young comrades as they faced what appeared to be overwhelming odds holds true today: “They that be with us are more than they that be with them” (2 Kings 6:16).</p>
<p>It is your journey ahead that I would like to address—the journey that will require careful planning and execution, wise use of your resources, and constant reliance on and dedication to eternal principles.</p>
<p>Nearly one hundred fifty years ago, a small band of settlers organized under George and Jacob Donner set out on a journey to a better life. At first their trek was typical of the scenes that had been played out time and again as pioneers made their way west to the rich lands of opportunity. But this was a misguided effort flawed by mistakes and misjudgments. Indeed, the Donner party was one of the most tragic dramas in the history of America.</p>
<p>The party included an assemblage of folks from Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, and Ohio. Of the ninety men, women, and children who began the trek, forty-two died; and those who lived struggled the rest of their lives with the effects of exposure, starvation, and wrenching memories. Their journey left an account for history that will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>The Donner party made their way to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, with little fanfare. But then they succumbed to the lure of a quicker, but unproven, route to California charted by a man named Lansford W. Hastings. Instead of the much-traveled course around the rugged Sierra mountains and then down to the California coast, the Donner party chose to go south through the Wasatch Mountains, down Echo Canyon, across the salt flats on the south side of the Great Salt Lake, and over the deserts of northern Nevada. They intended to clear the mountain pass near the present site of Reno, Nevada, before the snows fell.</p>
<p>Such was the outline for the journey, but they never made it. They got within one day of the last mountain pass before meeting with final disaster. What happened?</p>
<p>In May 1847, shortly after her rescue from the snowbound encampment near what is now Donner Lake, twelve-year-old survivor Virginia Reed wrote to her cousin in Illinois this message: “Never take no cutoffs and hurry along as fast as you can” (quoted in George R. Stewart, <i>Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party </i>[Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1960], p. 361).</p>
<p>We can learn much from Virginia and the historical accounts of the ill-fated journey. Many of the settlers, not able to part with their material luxuries of home, brought an excess of possessions that slowed the progress of the entire company. Factions splintered the group into camps of “us” and “them.” Before the party reached the Sierras, one of the members had killed another.</p>
<p>The single worst factor was taking an unproven shortcut. When Virginia said, “Don’t take no shortcuts”, she knew what she was talking about. The Hastings Cutoff was supposed to save as much as 300 miles, but the path led into a blind canyon. What reportedly would take a week took thirty days. Things just got worse. The stretch across the salt flats was almost twice the distance indicated, not forty but seventy miles. They had too few provisions and too little water for themselves and their animals.</p>
<p>Finally, upon reaching the towering Sierra Nevada range, they rested. They squandered their last week of good weather gathering strength for the final days. Had they not stopped they would have been only a footnote in the history of the developing West. But it snowed.</p>
<p>The party was one day short of clearing the pass when early storms in late October buried them in snow depths of more than twenty feet. They built crude shelters of logs, rocks, and hides, and ate twigs, mice, their animals that did not run away, and then their own shoes. Finally, some of them resorted to eating the dead. Four rescue parties worked their way in from the west that winter and spring to save those who were miraculously still alive.</p>
<p>Today, I want you to look at your journey. There are several lessons to be learned from the Donner party that have nothing to do with wagon trains and everything to do with exaltation. For you, the stakes are higher than a home in the untamed West. Your destination is eternal glory.</p>
<h2><b>Lesson One: “Never Take No Cutoffs”</b></h2>
<p>The Donner party took a shortcut, an unproven one at that. Beverly Sills, a famous musician familiar with the rigor of working to get someplace has said, “There are no shortcuts to anyplace worth going.” She was right. To be marooned in the middle of the mountains was not the destination of the Donners.</p>
<p>Our journey is clearly defined, the path well marked, the pitfalls noted. But the Lord is wise. He knows he must prove us, for he says, “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves” (Matthew 10:16).</p>
<p>We are not only here to learn, we are here to test that learning. That phase of this earthly journey was outlined from the beginning, for the scriptures tell us, “Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (Luke 2:52). He learned, like you are learning in this great institution dedicated to bringing forth righteous leaders.</p>
<p>For the Donner party there was a proven trail. It was longer, but it was sure. Gambling on their own abilities and personal ambitions, they took a road that had never been tested. The result is history.</p>
<p>The Lord says, “Enter ye in at the strait gate: . . . Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it” (Matthew 7:13–14).</p>
<p>As you follow the path of the Savior, keeping your covenants and his commandments, you will be assaulted from all sides with offers to take other roads, other travel packages. Anything the adversary can do to pull you off course, he will do. He’ll stop at nothing to catch your attention, and then, ever so slyly, he will lead you away from the work of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the dispensation of the fullness of times. We have been given the fullness of the gospel. To entice us from the path, Satan suggests a salad bar of sin—a little here and a little there until the plate is piled high and the price is paid. Knowing of his style and cunning, we must “press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 3:14).</p>
<p>There are some who are not satisfied with the peace that comes from the Lord. Seeking to find gratification in places other than in holy settings, they hang out—usually on a limb—and play into the hands of Satan and his evil designs. “Stand ye in holy places,” we are told, for the road back from sin is a long one (see D&amp;C 87:8).</p>
<p>Some break what they view as the lesser commandments, hoping that these will only be minor deductions in the final exam. They don’t keep the Sabbath day holy, they invite temptation, they seek release from the pressures of school with drugs or alcohol, they don’t fulfill their callings. They lie—just a little; they cheat—just when they need to; and they miss church meetings—only when they’re tired.</p>
<p>“Never take no cutoffs” means to enter in at the strait gate, my brothers and sisters, and to stay on the strait and narrow path. Such devotion to the Lord’s cause is difficult. But know that just as the Donner party set off with the best of intentions, you too can be led into blind canyons and forced to cross treacherous desert sands when you have strayed.</p>
<p>In this audience are some of the best the Lord has on this earth. You are here at BYU as part of your prescribed journey. President Benson has counseled that “Intelligence, or light and truth, becomes a vital force in our eternal journey” (<i>TETB, </i>p. 302).</p>
<p>This gathering of Saints is a sampling of the strength of the Lord’s force for righteousness in the last days. Does that give you pause? As a group you are capable of mighty works, but each of you must go forth on the journey as did Moroni, whose</p>
<p><i>heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</i></p>
<p><i>Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ. </i>[Alma 48:12–13]</p>
<p>With such devotion there are no sidesteps, no missteps. My dear young friends, there are no shortcuts to eternity.</p>
<h2><b>Lesson Two: Travel Light</b></h2>
<p>One of the families in the Donner party was unable to leave behind their cherished personal belongings. They had a specially built wagon twice the size of a typical Conestoga to carry their treasures across the wilderness. But the wagon was slow, cumbersome, and difficult to maneuver. Ultimately it was abandoned on the salt flats as water and rations became far more valuable than tables and chairs.</p>
<p>Reflect on the counsel of the Savior to the young man who asked, “Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” The Savior listed all the basic commandments, then next we read:</p>
<p><i>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</i></p>
<p><i>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.”</i></p>
<p><i>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. </i>[Matthew 19:16–22]</p>
<p>Are we willing to leave behind the world to become like God? Worldly comforts may temporarily minimize the impact of our struggles here on earth; they may give us comfort and a sense of importance, even a measure of success. But such reliance on material possessions deprives us of reliance upon our Heavenly Father and his saving grace. Our spiritual growth comes from seeing the Lord’s hand in our lives. There is little comparison between a worldly check register and our account in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
<h2><b>Lesson Three: Contention, Strife, Anger, and Derision Thwart Our Progress</b></h2>
<p>Relationships with one another are sacred trusts. That’s why we call each other brother and sister. We are indeed the closest of companions on this journey. Respect, honor, love, and humility are the basics for living with the Father. To practice and refine these traits here is to be in touch with the eternities today.</p>
<p>Reading the Book of Mormon puts clearly in front of us the debilitating nature of contention. The prophet Jacob mourned the dissension rampant among the people. At the end of his life he wrote,</p>
<p><i>I conclude this record . . . by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days. </i>[Jacob 7:26]</p>
<p>Then we read of a happier people who had just been visited by the Savior. Wrote the prophet Nephi,</p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i></p>
<p><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. </i>[4 Nephi 1:15–16]</p>
<p>Anger and friction delayed and divided the Donner party on their journey. Such discord led, in part, to their temporal tragedy. Satan loves dissension in any form. He encourages harsh feelings, angry words, ruthless judgments, scorn, pride, and the cruelest of actions.</p>
<p>Our greatest teacher and example on this point is Jesus Christ. To those unbelievers, those who wished him harm, those who plotted his capture and even his death, Jesus Christ showed mercy and compassion, charity and love that never wavered. No unkind words passed his lips. His behavior was always becoming of the King of Kings. What did the Lord say from the cross to those who jeered at him, spit upon him and called him names? “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34).</p>
<p>May we, too, forgive and love and honor each other on this journey.</p>
<h2><b>Lesson Four: “Hurry Along as Fast as You Can”</b></h2>
<p>The Donner party showed us the risks of taking our time. We have no time to lose—or even time to take it easy. I love the old Chinese saying, “Man who sit with legs crossed and mouth open waiting for roast duck to fly in have long hunger.”</p>
<p>We can’t sit. We can’t wait. The Donners waited, and the snows came, and their journey was a tragedy.</p>
<p>Recently, the administration here at BYU instituted a new policy to help students “hurry along” in their college training. This is not to deprive or limit an education, but instead it encourages you to focus on this season of your life. The new approach is designed to keep students from loading up on unneeded courses, encourages planning early, and increases the odds that a student will “graduate.” This is good advice applied to any task at any time. Such direction would have aided the Donners. It will reap benefits for you.</p>
<p>There is more to “hurrying along” than simply speeding up the system. We have to pace ourselves to get where we want to go. In the book of Joshua (24:15) we are told firmly, “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” When we look to this scripture we usually hear “choose” and “serve.” But notice it says “this day,” not tomorrow or the next day or when you finish your finals. It says, now. Right now. The Lord has told us, “I come quickly,” and he is a man of his word. We must be prepared.</p>
<p>This is not idle counsel. We read in Helaman 13:38, “Behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late.”</p>
<p>We cannot procrastinate our days of serving the Lord in his kingdom, or our daily reading of the scriptures until our class loads are lighter. Believe me, you are busy now; and it will never get better or easier. The load is always there, for the Lord is training you to lift and carry more and more. To sidestep such service is to miss opportunities in the kingdom that may not come again.</p>
<h2><b>Lesson Five: Sometimes We Need to Be Rescued</b></h2>
<p>Some of the members of the Donner party were saved only because of the timely rescue efforts of others, people who set aside their work and their personal safety to find those who were lost. Some of us in this room need rescuing—maybe some who aren’t here do too. And some of us are the rescuers. We aren’t being asked to strap on snow shoes and scale the west slope of the Sierras in the middle of winter; we are being asked to save souls, one person at a time. Remember, this is a spiritual journey, and this is the greatest work in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>I have a good friend who told me of a personal rescue that she holds close to her heart. She was a college student like you, but she attended that red-and-white institution to the north. (Some of you might think that was the source of her problems.) It was near the end of her senior year, and things were not falling together as she had hoped. She had applied to graduate school but wasn’t sure about taking that next step in her education. She was very involved in student affairs and recognized that these experiences that she loved were coming to an end. She was dating the missionary for whom she’d waited for two years, but she was also dating his best friend and had been for most of the time the missionary was gone. You get the picture. At that moment, her journey was a nightmare.</p>
<p>It was a Friday afternoon, and she was particularly downhearted. She hadn’t heard from any graduate schools. She was juggling dates for the weekend with both men. She had papers to write and projects to finish. Her little ten-year-old brother was the only one home, and he was begging her to play a game with him. She couldn’t stand to deal with life, so she left. She walked out the front door and up the street, and then she turned and began to walk toward the freeway. As she walked she heard a crunch on the gravel behind her, and turning she saw her little brother. He looked at her face streaked with tears and then asked, “Where ya going?”</p>
<p>She replied in a voice most dramatic, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>For a minute he looked at her, not sure what to do, and then he said, “Do you want to go to Skaggs?”</p>
<p>He was a rescuer that day. A little ten-year-old chasing a lost-looking sister around the corner and up the street. He knew something was wrong, didn’t know what, and yet he was the only one there. He made her laugh, and they went to Skaggs. She’ll never forget that day he saved her. He more than made her day.</p>
<p>How long has it been since you’ve made someone’s day? Or made a very bad day just a little bit better? Sometimes climbing up on that white horse feels good for the rider as well as the one in distress.</p>
<h2><b>The Last Lesson: Journeys Are Packed with Troubles</b></h2>
<p>The Donner party had big troubles that crippled their course. All of us have obstacles and difficulties in our lives. But let me contrast the difference in the approach of the Donner party with that of a band of Mormon pioneers crossing the Atlantic. William Clayton sailed from England to America in 1840 with a host of new converts. You know his name, for he later wrote the classic hymn “Come, Come Ye Saints.” The words are a testimony of his understanding of adversity as part of the eternal plan. After arriving in Nauvoo, Clayton wrote home to his fellow Saints in England and said:</p>
<p><i>We have sometimes almost suffocated with heat . . . sometimes almost froze with cold. We have had to sleep on boards instead of feathers, and on boxes which was worse. We have had our clothes wet through without the privilege of drying them or changing them. We have had to sleep out-of-doors in very severe weather. Don’t suppose for a moment that all will be peace and ease. . . . These are days of tribulation and we must endure our portion. </i>[And then he continued,] <i>If you will be faithful you have nothing to fear from the journey. The Lord will take care of his saints. </i>[William Clayton, letter from Commerce, 10 December 1840, Church Archives]</p>
<p>“Be faithful and you will have nothing to fear from the journey.” I testify to you today that this is true. Be faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the covenants you have made, and you will sing praises, “All is well.” I am not being simplistic when I say that our faith can carry us when we are weary, wounded, worn by the buffetings of the world, and wanting to go home. Faith can bring the journey of a lifetime. Look at Peter, who stepped off the boat to join Jesus. Peter stepped off because of his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He understood that with him all things are possible.</p>
<p>They are. I know this, and I promise you that such a testimony will come to you in your life as you exercise faith at the most trying of times.</p>
<p>The Lord loves you. Everyone of you is numbered, known, and loved by the Lord Jesus Christ. With such assurance, indeed, can’t we sing, “All is well”?</p>
<p>There are indeed reasons for our trials. Lorenzo Snow, fifth president of the Church, said, “You and I cannot be made perfect except through suffering: Jesus could not. In His prayer and agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, He foreshadowed the purifying process necessary . . . to secure the glory of a celestial kingdom” (10 January 1886, <i>JD</i> 26:367).</p>
<p>That concept of Gethsemane speaks to my heart. We all face those monumental periods in our lives when we turn to the Lord and pour out our souls, for the pain is too great to stand alone. Know that this, too, is part of the process of perfection. Let me share with you a poem that makes this point so well:</p>
<p><i>All those who journey, soon or late,</i><br />
<i>Must pass within the garden’s gate;</i><br />
<i>Must kneel alone in darkness there,</i><br />
<i>And battle with some fierce despair.</i><br />
<i>God pity those who cannot say,</i><br />
<i>“Not mine but thine,” who only pray,</i><br />
<i>“Let this cup pass,” and cannot see</i><br />
<i>The purpose in Gethsemane.</i><br />
[Ella Wheeler Wilcox, “Gethsemane,” <i>Poetical Works of Ella Wheeler Wilcox </i>(Edinburgh: W. P. Nimmo, Hay, &amp; Mitchell, 1917), pp. 133–34]</p>
<p>This life is a spiritual journey. There are lessons to be learned. Virginia said, “Never take no shortcuts,” and she was wise. Shortcuts only deflect us from the narrow trail. Travel light, be kind to everyone, hear with your heart when someone needs you. Hold your head high amid troubles and find comfort in the cry “All is well.”</p>
<p>Time is short, my brothers and sisters, so “hurry along as fast as you can.” We can do this for we are some of the Lord’s most faithful Saints, and he is with us. He hears our prayers. He knows our needs. We have nothing to fear from the journey; we are on a well-marked path that leads home, all the way home to our Father in Heaven. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your ­family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on—and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy—one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of God’s plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch—choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.2
With this gift of time, you won’t always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what ­happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Deter­mine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We can’t refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, ­faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of “outstanding life and contribution to society and the world.”
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, “With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor.”
Then my daughter exclaimed, “What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!”
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xi’an Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, “Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well.” Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer—now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater—in Chinese, “the mother school.”
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, “As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them.”
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto “Go forth to serve” has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, “go forth to serve” could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of one’s undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you—graduates, parents, and other supporters—thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: “Wow! So how do those fit together?” In some ways they don’t. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests—like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life” (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn’t end, the quest doesn’t end, and our relationships don’t end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didn’t know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: “Believe in yourself as I believe in you.” It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together (“Believe in Yourself,” The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
