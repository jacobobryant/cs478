  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I always look forward to commencement and have now been doing so for quite a few years. For Sharon and me, this is a special commencement because it marks a change not only in our ongoing personal activities but also for Brigham Young University. BYU faces a very bright future with the leadership of President Kevin J Worthen. Because we are also leaving, we hope you will not be offended if we consider ourselves to be quasi-members of the class of 2014.

We are sure for you graduates that your experiences have been different from our own during our shared time on this beautiful campus. I am confident in this statement because even for those who may have come to BYU together, chosen the same major, perhaps lived in the same apartments or dorms, attended the same wards, played on the same intramural teams, or served together in BYUSA, your experiences have been unique. What I also firmly believe is that for all of us privileged to have been at BYU, we now bear responsibilities that many others do not share.

Before I say more about that thought, let me express my congratulations to all of you for the impressive accomplishments you have demonstrated. Some are recorded in the commencement program and some are known only to you or a few especially close to you. Each is important and contributes to what you have become and what you now are equipped to do. All who are honest - and that should include every BYU graduate - will happily admit that their successes were not achieved alone. As we recognize this, let us all acknowledge the positive contributions of family, friends, teachers, support staff, and administrators who have helped us in our efforts here.

For the Samuelsons, the list of those who have helped us, supported us, educated us, and befriended us is long, but we are confident that those of you who have done so very much for us know who you are and hopefully will remember the special places you will hold in our hearts forever. No one can come to BYU and not be touched in important ways by the many positive influences and examples that are so common and yet so significant in our individual lives. There is no community quite like what we have here, and we find it impossible to express the gratitude and appreciation we feel for your goodness and stellar examples.

Now please let me reflect with all of you who join me today in acknowledging the tremendous blessings that have accrued to us while at BYU. The implications of what we have been able to experience are succinctly summarized in the words of the Savior found in section 82 of the Doctrine and Covenants as well as in Luke 12: "For of him [or her] unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3; see also Luke 12:48). No one with the intelligence and insight we can expect of a BYU graduate would dispute that all here, even those of you who have suffered with the most meager of worldly resources, have been given much.

That part is easy. Perhaps more difficult for all of us is determining what is required of us as we move into the next phase of our lives. We all want to do good and, if possible, even great things, but the details vary so broadly. I would submit, however, that in the differences of our interests, aptitudes, talents, opportunities, and choices there are some commonalities we should consider and take seriously.

For many reasons not necessary to share in our precious time today, I have found the counsel of the Lord to Hyrum Smith - through his brother, the Prophet Joseph - to be helpful and clarifying. When this revelation recorded in section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants was given in 1829, the Church had not yet been organized and both Joseph and Hyrum were in their twenties. They had no idea, I am sure, about the kind of education you have experienced at BYU, but Hyrum wanted to do something very important in assisting Joseph in the work of the Restoration. In his case it was to do missionary work, but in his thinking process I believe that his ambition was likely very similar to the motivations that most of you graduates feel as you go out into the world to make your way and make your contributions. You might find it profitable to read the thirty verses of this eleventh section because it is packed with relevant counsel for all of us.

Striking to me, however, is the fact that before He gave any specific instructions to Hyrum, the Lord repeated four times that Hyrums work was to "keep my commandments" (see D&amp;amp;C 11:6, 9, 18, 20). Knowing as you all do that repetition is a very powerful pedagogical device, I am impressed that the Lord wants all of us to remember that, whatever else we are doing with our lives, our work is to keep the commandments - not to put them on hold until we finish graduate school, land the job of our dreams, acquire a home and a mortgage, or anything else that currently is so proximately important to us. No, what is required of each of us is that we continue to keep the commandments, even with all else that we are doing.

I also love this general advice found in verse 12 that has roots in ancient scripture:

&lt;i&gt;And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good - yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 11:12]

We have all learned much at BYU, but none of us knows everything. Thus it behooves us to listen to and trust the Spirit of the Lord, which will guide and help us in our quest to keep the commandments, to do all that our great blessings require that we do, and to faithfully endure to the end.

As I congratulate and commend you, I again express my appreciation to you and to everyone who has and does contribute to the tremendous successes embodied in the graduates of Brigham Young University. BYU is an important part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and as such is very significant to all of us. I leave with you my blessing and my testimony of the reality of our loving and living Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. I share my witness of the reality of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors, even to President Thomas S. Monson, the prophet of our own day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I always look forward to commencement and have now been doing so for quite a few years. For Sharon and me, this is a special commencement because it marks a change not only in our ongoing personal activities but also for Brigham Young University. BYU faces a very bright future with the leadership of President Kevin J Worthen. Because we are also leaving, we hope you will not be offended if we consider ourselves to be quasi-members of the class of 2014.</p>
<p>We are sure for you graduates that your experiences have been different from our own during our shared time on this beautiful campus. I am confident in this statement because even for those who may have come to BYU together, chosen the same major, perhaps lived in the same apartments or dorms, attended the same wards, played on the same intramural teams, or served together in BYUSA, your experiences have been unique. What I also firmly believe is that for all of us privileged to have been at BYU, we now bear responsibilities that many others do not share.</p>
<p>Before I say more about that thought, let me express my congratulations to all of you for the impressive accomplishments you have demonstrated. Some are recorded in the commencement program and some are known only to you or a few especially close to you. Each is important and contributes to what you have become and what you now are equipped to do. All who are honest - and that should include every BYU graduate - will happily admit that their successes were not achieved alone. As we recognize this, let us all acknowledge the positive contributions of family, friends, teachers, support staff, and administrators who have helped us in our efforts here.</p>
<p>For the Samuelsons, the list of those who have helped us, supported us, educated us, and befriended us is long, but we are confident that those of you who have done so very much for us know who you are and hopefully will remember the special places you will hold in our hearts forever. No one can come to BYU and not be touched in important ways by the many positive influences and examples that are so common and yet so significant in our individual lives. There is no community quite like what we have here, and we find it impossible to express the gratitude and appreciation we feel for your goodness and stellar examples.</p>
<p>Now please let me reflect with all of you who join me today in acknowledging the tremendous blessings that have accrued to us while at BYU. The implications of what we have been able to experience are succinctly summarized in the words of the Savior found in section 82 of the Doctrine and Covenants as well as in Luke 12: "For of him [or her] unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;C 82:3; see also Luke 12:48). No one with the intelligence and insight we can expect of a BYU graduate would dispute that all here, even those of you who have suffered with the most meager of worldly resources, have been given much.</p>
<p>That part is easy. Perhaps more difficult for all of us is determining what is required of us as we move into the next phase of our lives. We all want to do good and, if possible, even great things, but the details vary so broadly. I would submit, however, that in the differences of our interests, aptitudes, talents, opportunities, and choices there are some commonalities we should consider and take seriously.</p>
<p>For many reasons not necessary to share in our precious time today, I have found the counsel of the Lord to Hyrum Smith - through his brother, the Prophet Joseph - to be helpful and clarifying. When this revelation recorded in section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants was given in 1829, the Church had not yet been organized and both Joseph and Hyrum were in their twenties. They had no idea, I am sure, about the kind of education you have experienced at BYU, but Hyrum wanted to do something very important in assisting Joseph in the work of the Restoration. In his case it was to do missionary work, but in his thinking process I believe that his ambition was likely very similar to the motivations that most of you graduates feel as you go out into the world to make your way and make your contributions. You might find it profitable to read the thirty verses of this eleventh section because it is packed with relevant counsel for all of us.</p>
<p>Striking to me, however, is the fact that before He gave any specific instructions to Hyrum, the Lord repeated four times that Hyrums work was to "keep my commandments" (see D&amp;C 11:6, 9, 18, 20). Knowing as you all do that repetition is a very powerful pedagogical device, I am impressed that the Lord wants all of us to remember that, whatever else we are doing with our lives, our work is to keep the commandments - not to put them on hold until we finish graduate school, land the job of our dreams, acquire a home and a mortgage, or anything else that currently is so proximately important to us. No, what is required of each of us is that we continue to keep the commandments, even with all else that we are doing.</p>
<p>I also love this general advice found in verse 12 that has roots in ancient scripture:</p>
<p><i>And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good - yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.</i> [D&amp;C 11:12]</p>
<p>We have all learned much at BYU, but none of us knows everything. Thus it behooves us to listen to and trust the Spirit of the Lord, which will guide and help us in our quest to keep the commandments, to do all that our great blessings require that we do, and to faithfully endure to the end.</p>
<p>As I congratulate and commend you, I again express my appreciation to you and to everyone who has and does contribute to the tremendous successes embodied in the graduates of Brigham Young University. BYU is an important part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and as such is very significant to all of us. I leave with you my blessing and my testimony of the reality of our loving and living Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. I share my witness of the reality of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors, even to President Thomas S. Monson, the prophet of our own day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you in this opening session of the 2017 BYU Campus Education Week. This years theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 50:24, with special emphasis on these words: "And he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light."
I am going to take a different approach to this theme than might be expected by exposing and illustrating some very cunning and effective ways that the "wicked one" prevents people from progressing and receiving more light (D&amp;C 93:39).
Many gospel principles come in pairs, meaning one is incomplete without the other. I want to refer to three of these doctrinal pairs today:

Agency and responsibility
Mercy and justice
Faith and works

When Satan is successful in dividing doctrinal pairs, he begins to wreak havoc upon mankind. It is one of his most cunning strategies to keep people from growing in the light.
You already know that faith without works really isnt faith (see James 2:17). My primary focus will be on the other two doctrinal pairs: first, to illustrate how avoiding responsibility affects agency; and second, how "denying justice," as it is referred to in the Book of Mormon (see Alma 42:30), affects mercy.
The Book of Mormon teaches us that we are agents to "act . . . and not to be acted upon" (2 Nephi 2:26) - or to be "free to act for [our]selves" (2 Nephi 10:23). This freedom of choice was not a gift of partial agency but of complete and total 100 percent agency. It was absolute in the sense that the One Perfect Parent never forces His children. He shows us the way and may even command us, but, "nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).
Assuming responsibility and being accountable for our choices are agencys complementary principles (see D&amp;C 101:78). Responsibility is to recognize ourselves as being the cause for the effects or results of our choices - good or bad. On the negative side, it is to always own up to the consequences of poor choices.
Except for those held innocent, such as little children and the intellectually disabled, gospel doctrine teaches us that each person is responsible for the use of their agency and "will be punished for their own sins" (Articles of Faith 1:2).1 It isnt just a heavenly principle but a law of nature - we reap what we sow.
Logically then, complete and total agency comes with complete and total responsibility:
 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it u</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of "outstanding life and contribution to society and the world."
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, "With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor."
Then my daughter exclaimed, "What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!"
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xian Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, "Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well." Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer - now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater - in Chinese, "the mother school."
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, "As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them."
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto "Go forth to serve" has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, "go forth to serve" could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of ones undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. As was noted in the introduction, I come from Australia, so thats why I think you talk funny. As was also mentioned, Im a linguist. Linguistics is the scientific study of language.
In 1978 Pam and I were living a pretty comfortable life in Brisbane, Australia. We had a nice house close to Pams parents and three wonderful children, ages five, four, and two. I had a good job. But I also had a dream. I wanted to know more about how language works, especially for people acquiring a second language. At that time one of the best graduate linguistics programs in the world was at the University of Southern California, located just south of downtown Los Angeles. So we left this good life and went off to Los Angeles.
The second day in LA we bundled the kids into a borrowed car and visited the USC campus to keep an appointment with a linguistics professor. I was excited to be finally going to the temple of my academic dreams. We arrived on campus and acquired a campus map, but there was no Linguistics Department listed on the map. We found a traffic station and asked a security guard where the Linguistics Department was.
"The what?" he asked.
"The Linguistics Department," I answered.
He picked up a phone and asked, "Hey, Joe, do you know where the ling . . . ling . . ." Turning to me, he asked, "The what?"
"The Linguistics Department."
"Do you know where the Linguistics Department is?"
We eventually found the department in a rickety old building. It wasnt a good start. Ill never forget the bemused smile on Pams face as we began this adventure. Thank you, Pam.
Most days I leave my BYU office in the early evening and wander around campus trying to remember where I parked the car that morning. I look at the beautiful mountains, this incredible campus, and the miracle that each of you represents. I cant help but think of G. K. Chestertons poem titled "Evening":
Here dies another day
During which I have had eyes, ears, hands
And the great world round me;
And with tomorrow begins another.
Why am I allowed two?
This is what Id like to talk to you about today - some aspects of this great world around us and how we interact with the world using our eyes, ears, and hands. Perhaps I can also provide one answer to why we are allowed so many days beyond the one.
What is our relationship to the great world around us? We are told to be "in the world but not of the world." We are instructed to "go . . . into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15), which of course we take to mean preaching the gospel to all of Gods children. In so doing we follow the example of Christ, who also went "into the world" (John 3:17). Based upon how Christ went into the world, let me suggest that going into the world means righteously </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Fall has always been one of my favorite times of the year. I love the changing colors of the leaves and the crispness in the air. I remember the excitement I felt in my younger years at the beginning of a new school year. Even though I am no longer attending school, I am blessed to be associated with all of you here at Brigham Young University. It is a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to share this exhilaration with you and express a heartfelt welcome to fall semester at this wonderful place. Hopefully your summer months were pleasant and the memories will not be forgotten during the exciting and sometimes stressful days ahead.
This past summer I had the opportunity to travel over and sail under one of the marvels of New York City: the Brooklyn Bridge. It is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States and was completed in 1883. It connects the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. At the time of its construction it was the longest suspension bridge in the world and continued to be so until 1903. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.
The Brooklyn Bridge took thirteen years to complete and could not have been constructed and have endured these many years without detailed blueprints, knowledge of mathematics, use of strong and sturdy materials, and innovative tools and equipment as well as careful and strategic planning and study. There was also much diligent and hard work involved in the process. Construction did not always go as planned, and accidents occurred and lives were even lost. There were times of discouragement as well as satisfaction during those thirteen years, but a bridge was erected that is strong and safe. The original designer was John Roebling, who died as a result of an accident that occurred when he was conducting surveys for the bridge project. He began construction of a bridge he never had the opportunity to cross, and it stands today as an engineering marvel.
All of you here today are crossing bridges you did not build but that were constructed by others to bless your lives in many ways and circumstances that are truly remarkable. Your education at Brigham Young University is possible because of men and women who valued education and learning in an atmosphere of faith. They built these bridges through their hard work, foresight, and testimonies of what Brigham Young University could and would become in the future.
For example, there is the prophet Brigham Young, who asked a German convert, Karl G. Maeser, to go to Provo to be the principal of Brigham Young Academy. Brother Maeser became the spiritual architect of what is now the largest private, church-sponsored university in the United States, which also has the reputation of high academic standards as well as for being "stone-cold sober."
