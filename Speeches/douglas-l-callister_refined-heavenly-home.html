  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Half a century ago Elder Adam S. Bennion of the Quorum of the Twelve was the assigned speaker at this devotional. His address was preceded by a stirring passage from &lt;i&gt;Cavalleria Rusticana&lt;/i&gt; by Mascagni, performed by one of the universitys fine choral groups. Elder Bennion was so touched that he began his message with these words: "I will shorten my remarks today so that this musical masterpiece may be performed for us a second time at the close of this assembly."

The nearer we get to God, the more easily our spirits are touched by refined and beautiful things. If we could part the veil and observe our heavenly home, we would be impressed with the cultivated minds and hearts of those who so happily live there. I imagine that our heavenly parents are exquisitely refined. In this great gospel of emulation, one of the purposes of our earthly probation is to become like them in every conceivable way so that we may be comfortable in the presence of heavenly parentage and, in the language of Enos, see their faces "with pleasure."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Brigham Young said: "We are trying to be the image of those who live in heaven; we are trying to pattern after them, to look like them, to walk and talk like them."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; To prepare us to do this, the 13th article of faith encourages: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Refinement is a companion to developed spirituality. Refinement and spirituality are two strings drawn by the same bow.

Today I would like to peek behind the veil that temporarily separates us from our heavenly home and paint a word picture of the virtuous, lovely, and refined circumstances that exist there. I will speak of the language, literature, music, and art of heaven, as well as the immaculate appearance of heavenly beings, for I believe that in heaven we will find each of these in pure and perfected form.

God speaks all languages, and He speaks them properly. He is restrained and modest of speech. When God described the grand creational process of this earth, He said in measured tones that "it was good."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; We would be disappointed if God had to use "awesome" or other exaggerated phrases in every paragraph.

Britains Ben Jonson said: "Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee."&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Our language reveals our thoughts, our virtues, our insecurities, our doubts, even the homes from which we come. We will feel more comfortable in Heavenly Fathers presence if we have developed proper habits of speech. We not only wish to see Gods face "with pleasure," we want to open our mouths with confidence that our speech harmonizes with the refinement of heaven.

We will thrill to hear exalted beings express their sublime thoughts in perfectly chosen words. I suppose that the language of heaven, properly spoken, may approach a form of music. Did C. S. Lewis have this in mind when he wrote: "Isnt it funny the way some combinations of words can give you - almost apart from their meaning - a thrill like music?"&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; At Jesus birth the angels appeared and spoke, not sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; We now try to capture that beauty in song, but the original angelic utterance was in spoken words, which thrilled like music.

Van Wyck Brooks, in his biography &lt;i&gt;The Life of Emerson,&lt;/i&gt; told us that Ralph Waldo Emerson was invited to speak at the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Shakespeares birth. After proper introduction Emerson presented himself at the pulpit and then sat down. He had forgotten his notes. He preferred to say nothing rather than words not well measured. For some, it was Emerson in one of his most eloquent hours.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

A few years ago I overheard a Church leader lament the fact that he never had time for anything except to read the scriptures and other works of literature and to prepare talks. His wife admiringly responded, "I know, dear. We all know. We know every time you stand up to speak." As he spoke, listeners saw. The unremitting preparation through a lifetime of reading great literature naturally produced messages eloquent in both phrase and substance.

Refinement in speech is more than polished elocution. It results from purity of thought and sincerity of expression. A childs prayer on occasion may reflect the language of heaven more nearly than a Shakespearean soliloquy.

Refinement in speech is reflected not only in our choice of words but also in the things we talk about. There are those who always speak of themselves, and they are either insecure or proud. There are those who always speak of others. They are usually very boring. There are those who speak of stirring ideas, compelling books, and inspiring doctrine. These are the few who make their mark in this world. The subjects discussed in heaven are not trifling or mundane. They are sublime beyond our most extended imagination. We will feel at home there if we are rehearsed on this earth in conversing about the refined and noble, clothing our expressions in well-measured words.

I grew up in a home in which the Sunday afternoon meal was an institution. We remained in our church attire. My parents almost always invited a special guest to join us at the dinner table. Several times it was the then president of this university. We were expected to remain at the table and converse about worthwhile things. In later years, as a student at this school, we attempted to do the same, often gathering in one of the Heritage Halls kitchens on a Sabbath afternoon for a reverie of uplifting conversation.

Is there a generation today that needs to be superficially entertained? What is the prospect of a young man sitting in a dorm on Friday evening to read a great book and be thrilled by the music of the masters? Is Friday evening a frenetic flight to see where the entertainment and action will be? Could our society produce a Newton or a Mozart? Can 85 channels and uncountable DVDs ever fill our insatiable appetite to be entertained? Do any unwisely become addicted to computer games or Internet surfing, thereby missing the richer experiences of great reading, conversations, and music enjoyment?

One wrote: "We need the slower and more lasting stimulus of solitary reading as a relief from the pressure on eye, ear and nerves of the torrent of information and entertainment pouring from ever-open electronic jaws."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; This solitary reading should evidence our spiritual and refined taste in selection of the reading materials.

Another said: "[Education] has produced a vast population able to read but unable to distinguish what is worth reading."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; This happy chapter of your lives at Brigham Young University will help you focus on reading materials of greatest worth.

I dont know whether our heavenly home has a television set or a DVD machine, but in my minds imagery it surely has a grand piano and a magnificent library. There was a fine library in the home of President Hinckleys youth. It was not an ostentatious home, but the library contained about 1,000 volumes of the rich literature of the world, and President Hinckley spent his early years immersed in these books. When President Hinckley once came to my home, he spent time perusing the library. He observed the 50-volume collection of the Harvard Classics, commented that he has the same collection in his home, and said he had read much of it. To be well read, however, it is not necessary to possess expensive collections of literature, for they are available to rich and poor alike in the libraries of the world.

President David O. McKay was inclined to awaken at 4:00 a.m., skim read up to two books each day, and then commence his labors at 6:00 a.m. He could quote 1,000 poems from memory. We knew that whenever he stood at the pulpit. He referred to the grand masters of literature as the "minor prophets." He was a living embodiment of the scriptural admonition to "seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom."&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

My wife and I recently spent four years on Church assignment in Eastern Europe, residing in Moscow, Russia. We often traveled on the Moscow underground subway called the Metro. We noticed the bowed heads of the Russian passengers, for they were reading Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoyevsky, or Pushkin - and, sometimes, Mark Twain. The people were poor, but they were not obsessed with their poverty. They possessed the rich tradition of Russian literature, art, and music.

Elder James E. Talmage, before his call to the Twelve, was a mining geologist. He once spoke of the features of certain geology he had observed during a field trip more than a year before. He explained that he could not with certainty recall the terrain until after he developed a photograph he had made of the location. The photographic plate had been laid away in darkness for an extended time. It had only been exposed to the light for one-fiftieth of a second - but the image was indelibly impressed on the negative, awaiting a future date to reveal its message.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

The lesson does not escape us. The images to which our minds are exposed are held in store, seemingly forgotten, even for years. But at the crucial moment they re-present themselves to influence our thoughts and lives. And so it is with the music, literature, art, media, and other images to which we are exposed. The pamphlet &lt;i&gt;For the Strength of Youth&lt;/i&gt; states: "Whatever you read, listen to, or look at has an effect on you. Therefore, choose only entertainment and media that uplift you."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

These are the words of President McKay:

&lt;i&gt;As with companions so with books. We may choose those which will make us better, more intelligent, more appreciative of the good and the beautiful in the world, or we may choose the trashy, the vulgar, the obscene, which will make us feel as though weve been "wallowing in the mire."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

If we know the books located at the bedside, we know much about the man.

A good book, such as the scriptures, becomes a lifelong companion. A thoughtful man wrote:

&lt;i&gt;An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I cant imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Clearly one must read every good book at least once every ten years.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The sure mark of an unliterary man is that he considers "Ive read it already" to be a conclusive argument against reading a work. . . . Those who read great works, on the other hand, will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of their life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

Of all the works worthy of repetitive reading, the scriptures stand paramount, for they are not founded in the opinions of men. Over the years I have oft remembered the counsel of the late Hugh Nibley: "If you pray for an angel to visit you, you know what hell do if he comes. Hell just quote the scriptures to you - so youre wasting your time waiting for what we already have."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

Many years ago, while living in another part of the country, I became acquainted with a fine Latter-day Saint young man. He was a superior athlete, but he had never attended a cultural event. Living in the same community was a lovely young LDS sister. She spoke French as well as English. She played the violin. She presented herself as a refined daughter of God. One day the American Ballet Theatre came to our town. A group of us decided to attend, including this young man and young woman.

Now and then I glanced at the young man during the ballet. His eyes were riveted on the stage. Windows of new appreciation were opened. After the performance he approached me privately and said, in reference to the refined young sister, "Where have I been all of my life? This is what I want in my home. This is what I want as the mother of my children. Until now I thought only physical appearance mattered." I gently reminded him that she would likely be drawn to one of refined nature, like herself, and it was time for him to look within.

Dear daughters of God, you are the crown jewels of all of His creations. There has never been a sunset, symphony, or work of art as lovely as you. May you catch the vision that you are destined to be a refined and regal queen, honored by an uncountable posterity, worlds without end.

If we could peek behind the heavenly veil we would likely be inspired by the music of heaven, perhaps more glorious than any music we have heard on this earth.

When some music has passed the tests of time and been cherished by the noble and refined, our failure to appreciate it is not an indictment of grand music. The omission is within. If a young person grows up on a steady diet of hamburgers and french fries, he is not likely to become a gourmet. But the fault is not with fine food. He just grew up on something less. Some have grown up on a steady diet of musical french fries.

Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:

&lt;i&gt;We . . . live in a world that is too prone to the tasteless, and we need to provide an opportunity to cultivate a taste for the finest music. And, likewise, were in a world thats so attuned to the now that we need to permit people to be more attuned to the best music of all the ages.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

A few years ago I made my way to the bedroom of one of my sons to say good night. He was a junior in high school. As I approached his room, I heard the strains of Tchaikovskys sixth symphony. I was surprised. I knew the boy loved sports, but I didnt know he loved Tchaikovsky. Months later, as my wife and I were listening to a videotape of three tenors singing, our son came in and sat down. He listened and saw, and a new appreciation developed. He said: "You never told me about opera." He took the videotape to his room, and I never saw it again. Appreciation of the finest in music does not depend upon your age.

President J. Reuben Clark of the First Presidency, one of our greatest Christ scholars, used to listen to inspirational music in the evening before he began his insightful writings concerning the life of the Savior. The music opened his spiritual pores, as it does for all of us.

Recognizing the penetrating influence of great music, Oscar Wilde had one of his characters say: "After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and mourning over tragedies that were not my own."&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; After the first performance of &lt;i&gt;Messiah,&lt;/i&gt; Handel said: "My lord, I should be sorry if I only entertained them; I wish to make them better."&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Haydn "dressed in his best clothes to compose because he said he was going before his maker."&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;

There are events of life so sublime that they cannot be imagined without the companionship of beautiful music. We could not have a Christmas without carols or a general conference without sacred anthems. And there could not be a heaven without music of surpassing beauty. Brigham Young said: "There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven."&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; It would be punishment enough to go to hell and not hear a note of music for all eternity.

This would be a good time to sift through your music library and choose primarily that which uplifts and inspires. It is part of the maturing process of your eternal journey. This would also be a fine time to learn a musical instrument or improve musical skills now partially possessed.

On the eve of his release, one of my fine missionaries during my tenure as a mission president spoke of a girl at home with whom he intended to renew association.

He inquired, "How will I know if she is the right one?"

I suggested, among other things, that he invite her to a cultural event. If she responded that this would be of no interest to her, then maybe he should pursue other alternatives. But if she had compelling spiritual qualities and could be enthralled by culture on Friday and love the athletic contest on Saturday, she might be the type of young lady he could choose as the mother for his children. It might be balanced and rewarding to be paired with her for eternity.

That which has been said about bringing great language, music, and literature into the home may be said with equal truth of great art - perhaps tastefully displayed in our heavenly home. It may also be said of our physical appearance and manners, as well as the order of the place in which we live, the way we offer our prayers, and the way we read Gods word.

I once had opportunity to visit briefly with Audrey Hepburn, the great actress of days gone by, at the time she was making the movie &lt;i&gt;My Fair Lady.&lt;/i&gt; She spoke of the opening scene in the movie in which she depicted a modest, unpolished flower girl. Her face had been besmirched with charcoal to make her seem part of her surroundings. "But," she said, with a twinkle in her eye, "I was wearing my Chanel perfume. Inside I still knew I was a lady." It doesnt take expensive perfume to make a lady, but it does require cleanliness, modesty, self-respect, and pride in ones appearance.

Many years ago an associate of mine decided he would please his wife by sharing with her a very specific compliment each night as he arrived home. One night he praised her cooking. A second night he thanked her for excellence in housekeeping. A third night he acknowledged her fine influence on the children. The fourth night, before he could speak, she said: "I know what you are doing. I thank you for it. But dont say any of those things. Just tell me you think I am beautiful."

She expressed an important need that she had. Women ought to be praised for all the gifts they possess that so unselfishly add to the richness of our lives, including their attentiveness to their personal appearance. We must not "let ourselves go" and become so casual - even sloppy - in our appearance that we distance ourselves from the beauty heaven has given us. Every man has the right to be married to a woman who makes herself as beautiful as she can be and who looks in the mirror to tidy herself up before he comes home. Every woman has a right to be married to a man who keeps himself clean, physically as well as morally, and takes pride in his appearance. A husband should hurry home because of the angel who awaits him, and that angel should be watching the clock awaiting his arrival.

Occasionally a young man comes home from his mission and hastens to distance himself in appearance from everything associated with missionary service. He becomes slovenly. Heaven blushes. The young man who wants an exemplary spouse needs to look in the mirror and ask why she would want him. Then he should shave and press his clothes.

Years ago I attended a stake conference in California at which the wife of the stake president shared this story: She had been born considerably after the other children in the family, and her father was unusually protective of her. When a suitor would stop by to pick her up for a date, the father would look him over very carefully and then say: "Do you want to date my princess? Go home and wash your car and shine your shoes. Then I will give my permission." I sometimes wonder if our Heavenly Father whispers the same when we date His precious daughters. The Book of Mormon speaks of a people who "did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely."&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

There are those who flippantly say: "How I look has nothing to do with how God feels about me." But it is possible for both earthly and heavenly parents to have unspoken disappointment in their offspring without diminished love. I say it again: Sometimes heaven blushes but loves on.

President Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the Church, owned few things, but he took care of them. He was fastidious in his appearance. He pressed his dollar bills to remove the wrinkles. He allowed none but himself to pack his overnight bag. He knew where every article, nut, and bolt of the household was, and each had its place.

Would this be true of the environment in which you live? Is it a house of order? Need you dust, clean, and rearrange before you invite the Spirit of the Lord into your apartment? President Lorenzo Snow said: "The Lord does not intend that the Saints shall live always in dens and caves of the earth, but that they shall build fine houses. When the Lord comes he will not expect to meet a dirty people, but a people of refinement."&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;

David Starr Jordan, a former president of Stanford University, wrote:

&lt;i&gt;To be vulgar is to do that which is not the best of its kind. It is to do poor things in poor ways, and to be satisfied with that. . . . It is vulgar to wear dirty linen when one is not engaged in dirty work. It is vulgar to like poor music, to read weak books, to feed on sensational newspapers, . . . to find amusement in trashy novels, to enjoy vulgar theatres, to find pleasure in cheap jokes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;

I once heard a story about an imaginary king whose wife gave birth to a baby boy. The parents knew that the lad would someday inherit the kingdom. Desiring that their son be a wise king, fully familiar with the needs of the people over whom he would reign, the king and queen took the infant into the country to be raised as part of a peasant family. He was to be told nothing of his secret destiny until he became a man.

At the appropriate time the king and queen returned to the country to confer on their son the kingdom. They were greatly disappointed. Having been told nothing of his appointed destiny, he was exactly that which life had prepared him to be. He understood the proper care of animals and the gathering of crops, but he knew nothing of armies and palaces and courtyards and presiding. He had lost his vision.

It should not be difficult for you to glean the truth in this story. Another King, your Father in Heaven, has sent you away from His presence to have experiences you would not have had in your heavenly home - all in preparation for the conferral of a kingdom. He doesnt want you to lose your vision. You are children of an exalted being. You are foreordained to preside as kings and queens. You will live in a home and environment of infinite refinement and beauty, as reflected in the language, literature, art, music, and order of heaven.

I close with the words of President Brigham Young: "Let us . . . show to the world that we have talent and taste, and prove to the heavens that our minds are set on beauty and true excellence, so that we can become worthy to enjoy the society of angels."&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Even more, that we may enjoy the refined society of heavenly parentage, for we are of the race of the gods, being children of the Most High.

This is my testimony and my humble supplication for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Half a century ago Elder Adam S. Bennion of the Quorum of the Twelve was the assigned speaker at this devotional. His address was preceded by a stirring passage from <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> by Mascagni, performed by one of the universitys fine choral groups. Elder Bennion was so touched that he began his message with these words: "I will shorten my remarks today so that this musical masterpiece may be performed for us a second time at the close of this assembly."</p>
<p>The nearer we get to God, the more easily our spirits are touched by refined and beautiful things. If we could part the veil and observe our heavenly home, we would be impressed with the cultivated minds and hearts of those who so happily live there. I imagine that our heavenly parents are exquisitely refined. In this great gospel of emulation, one of the purposes of our earthly probation is to become like them in every conceivable way so that we may be comfortable in the presence of heavenly parentage and, in the language of Enos, see their faces "with pleasure."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Brigham Young said: "We are trying to be the image of those who live in heaven; we are trying to pattern after them, to look like them, to walk and talk like them."<sup>2</sup> To prepare us to do this, the 13th article of faith encourages: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."<sup>3</sup> Refinement is a companion to developed spirituality. Refinement and spirituality are two strings drawn by the same bow.</p>
<p>Today I would like to peek behind the veil that temporarily separates us from our heavenly home and paint a word picture of the virtuous, lovely, and refined circumstances that exist there. I will speak of the language, literature, music, and art of heaven, as well as the immaculate appearance of heavenly beings, for I believe that in heaven we will find each of these in pure and perfected form.</p>
<p>God speaks all languages, and He speaks them properly. He is restrained and modest of speech. When God described the grand creational process of this earth, He said in measured tones that "it was good."<sup>4</sup> We would be disappointed if God had to use "awesome" or other exaggerated phrases in every paragraph.</p>
<p>Britains Ben Jonson said: "Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee."<sup>5</sup> Our language reveals our thoughts, our virtues, our insecurities, our doubts, even the homes from which we come. We will feel more comfortable in Heavenly Fathers presence if we have developed proper habits of speech. We not only wish to see Gods face "with pleasure," we want to open our mouths with confidence that our speech harmonizes with the refinement of heaven.</p>
<p>We will thrill to hear exalted beings express their sublime thoughts in perfectly chosen words. I suppose that the language of heaven, properly spoken, may approach a form of music. Did C. S. Lewis have this in mind when he wrote: "Isnt it funny the way some combinations of words can give you - almost apart from their meaning - a thrill like music?"<sup>6</sup> At Jesus birth the angels appeared and spoke, not sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."<sup>7</sup> We now try to capture that beauty in song, but the original angelic utterance was in spoken words, which thrilled like music.</p>
<p>Van Wyck Brooks, in his biography <i>The Life of Emerson,</i> told us that Ralph Waldo Emerson was invited to speak at the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Shakespeares birth. After proper introduction Emerson presented himself at the pulpit and then sat down. He had forgotten his notes. He preferred to say nothing rather than words not well measured. For some, it was Emerson in one of his most eloquent hours.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>A few years ago I overheard a Church leader lament the fact that he never had time for anything except to read the scriptures and other works of literature and to prepare talks. His wife admiringly responded, "I know, dear. We all know. We know every time you stand up to speak." As he spoke, listeners saw. The unremitting preparation through a lifetime of reading great literature naturally produced messages eloquent in both phrase and substance.</p>
<p>Refinement in speech is more than polished elocution. It results from purity of thought and sincerity of expression. A childs prayer on occasion may reflect the language of heaven more nearly than a Shakespearean soliloquy.</p>
<p>Refinement in speech is reflected not only in our choice of words but also in the things we talk about. There are those who always speak of themselves, and they are either insecure or proud. There are those who always speak of others. They are usually very boring. There are those who speak of stirring ideas, compelling books, and inspiring doctrine. These are the few who make their mark in this world. The subjects discussed in heaven are not trifling or mundane. They are sublime beyond our most extended imagination. We will feel at home there if we are rehearsed on this earth in conversing about the refined and noble, clothing our expressions in well-measured words.</p>
<p>I grew up in a home in which the Sunday afternoon meal was an institution. We remained in our church attire. My parents almost always invited a special guest to join us at the dinner table. Several times it was the then president of this university. We were expected to remain at the table and converse about worthwhile things. In later years, as a student at this school, we attempted to do the same, often gathering in one of the Heritage Halls kitchens on a Sabbath afternoon for a reverie of uplifting conversation.</p>
<p>Is there a generation today that needs to be superficially entertained? What is the prospect of a young man sitting in a dorm on Friday evening to read a great book and be thrilled by the music of the masters? Is Friday evening a frenetic flight to see where the entertainment and action will be? Could our society produce a Newton or a Mozart? Can 85 channels and uncountable DVDs ever fill our insatiable appetite to be entertained? Do any unwisely become addicted to computer games or Internet surfing, thereby missing the richer experiences of great reading, conversations, and music enjoyment?</p>
<p>One wrote: "We need the slower and more lasting stimulus of solitary reading as a relief from the pressure on eye, ear and nerves of the torrent of information and entertainment pouring from ever-open electronic jaws."<sup>9</sup> This solitary reading should evidence our spiritual and refined taste in selection of the reading materials.</p>
<p>Another said: "[Education] has produced a vast population able to read but unable to distinguish what is worth reading."<sup>10</sup> This happy chapter of your lives at Brigham Young University will help you focus on reading materials of greatest worth.</p>
<p>I dont know whether our heavenly home has a television set or a DVD machine, but in my minds imagery it surely has a grand piano and a magnificent library. There was a fine library in the home of President Hinckleys youth. It was not an ostentatious home, but the library contained about 1,000 volumes of the rich literature of the world, and President Hinckley spent his early years immersed in these books. When President Hinckley once came to my home, he spent time perusing the library. He observed the 50-volume collection of the Harvard Classics, commented that he has the same collection in his home, and said he had read much of it. To be well read, however, it is not necessary to possess expensive collections of literature, for they are available to rich and poor alike in the libraries of the world.</p>
<p>President David O. McKay was inclined to awaken at 4:00 a.m., skim read up to two books each day, and then commence his labors at 6:00 a.m. He could quote 1,000 poems from memory. We knew that whenever he stood at the pulpit. He referred to the grand masters of literature as the "minor prophets." He was a living embodiment of the scriptural admonition to "seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom."<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>My wife and I recently spent four years on Church assignment in Eastern Europe, residing in Moscow, Russia. We often traveled on the Moscow underground subway called the Metro. We noticed the bowed heads of the Russian passengers, for they were reading Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoyevsky, or Pushkin - and, sometimes, Mark Twain. The people were poor, but they were not obsessed with their poverty. They possessed the rich tradition of Russian literature, art, and music.</p>
<p>Elder James E. Talmage, before his call to the Twelve, was a mining geologist. He once spoke of the features of certain geology he had observed during a field trip more than a year before. He explained that he could not with certainty recall the terrain until after he developed a photograph he had made of the location. The photographic plate had been laid away in darkness for an extended time. It had only been exposed to the light for one-fiftieth of a second - but the image was indelibly impressed on the negative, awaiting a future date to reveal its message.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>The lesson does not escape us. The images to which our minds are exposed are held in store, seemingly forgotten, even for years. But at the crucial moment they re-present themselves to influence our thoughts and lives. And so it is with the music, literature, art, media, and other images to which we are exposed. The pamphlet <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> states: "Whatever you read, listen to, or look at has an effect on you. Therefore, choose only entertainment and media that uplift you."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>These are the words of President McKay:</p>
<p><i>As with companions so with books. We may choose those which will make us better, more intelligent, more appreciative of the good and the beautiful in the world, or we may choose the trashy, the vulgar, the obscene, which will make us feel as though weve been "wallowing in the mire."</i><sup>14</sup></p>
<p>If we know the books located at the bedside, we know much about the man.</p>
<p>A good book, such as the scriptures, becomes a lifelong companion. A thoughtful man wrote:</p>
<p><i>An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p><i>I cant imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once.</i><sup>16</sup></p>
<p><i>Clearly one must read every good book at least once every ten years.</i><sup>17</sup></p>
<p><i>The sure mark of an unliterary man is that he considers "Ive read it already" to be a conclusive argument against reading a work. . . . Those who read great works, on the other hand, will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of their life.</i><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Of all the works worthy of repetitive reading, the scriptures stand paramount, for they are not founded in the opinions of men. Over the years I have oft remembered the counsel of the late Hugh Nibley: "If you pray for an angel to visit you, you know what hell do if he comes. Hell just quote the scriptures to you - so youre wasting your time waiting for what we already have."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Many years ago, while living in another part of the country, I became acquainted with a fine Latter-day Saint young man. He was a superior athlete, but he had never attended a cultural event. Living in the same community was a lovely young LDS sister. She spoke French as well as English. She played the violin. She presented herself as a refined daughter of God. One day the American Ballet Theatre came to our town. A group of us decided to attend, including this young man and young woman.</p>
<p>Now and then I glanced at the young man during the ballet. His eyes were riveted on the stage. Windows of new appreciation were opened. After the performance he approached me privately and said, in reference to the refined young sister, "Where have I been all of my life? This is what I want in my home. This is what I want as the mother of my children. Until now I thought only physical appearance mattered." I gently reminded him that she would likely be drawn to one of refined nature, like herself, and it was time for him to look within.</p>
<p>Dear daughters of God, you are the crown jewels of all of His creations. There has never been a sunset, symphony, or work of art as lovely as you. May you catch the vision that you are destined to be a refined and regal queen, honored by an uncountable posterity, worlds without end.</p>
<p>If we could peek behind the heavenly veil we would likely be inspired by the music of heaven, perhaps more glorious than any music we have heard on this earth.</p>
<p>When some music has passed the tests of time and been cherished by the noble and refined, our failure to appreciate it is not an indictment of grand music. The omission is within. If a young person grows up on a steady diet of hamburgers and french fries, he is not likely to become a gourmet. But the fault is not with fine food. He just grew up on something less. Some have grown up on a steady diet of musical french fries.</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:</p>
<p><i>We . . . live in a world that is too prone to the tasteless, and we need to provide an opportunity to cultivate a taste for the finest music. And, likewise, were in a world thats so attuned to the now that we need to permit people to be more attuned to the best music of all the ages.</i><sup>20</sup></p>
<p>A few years ago I made my way to the bedroom of one of my sons to say good night. He was a junior in high school. As I approached his room, I heard the strains of Tchaikovskys sixth symphony. I was surprised. I knew the boy loved sports, but I didnt know he loved Tchaikovsky. Months later, as my wife and I were listening to a videotape of three tenors singing, our son came in and sat down. He listened and saw, and a new appreciation developed. He said: "You never told me about opera." He took the videotape to his room, and I never saw it again. Appreciation of the finest in music does not depend upon your age.</p>
<p>President J. Reuben Clark of the First Presidency, one of our greatest Christ scholars, used to listen to inspirational music in the evening before he began his insightful writings concerning the life of the Savior. The music opened his spiritual pores, as it does for all of us.</p>
<p>Recognizing the penetrating influence of great music, Oscar Wilde had one of his characters say: "After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and mourning over tragedies that were not my own."<sup>21</sup> After the first performance of <i>Messiah,</i> Handel said: "My lord, I should be sorry if I only entertained them; I wish to make them better."<sup>22</sup> Haydn "dressed in his best clothes to compose because he said he was going before his maker."<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>There are events of life so sublime that they cannot be imagined without the companionship of beautiful music. We could not have a Christmas without carols or a general conference without sacred anthems. And there could not be a heaven without music of surpassing beauty. Brigham Young said: "There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven."<sup>24</sup> It would be punishment enough to go to hell and not hear a note of music for all eternity.</p>
<p>This would be a good time to sift through your music library and choose primarily that which uplifts and inspires. It is part of the maturing process of your eternal journey. This would also be a fine time to learn a musical instrument or improve musical skills now partially possessed.</p>
<p>On the eve of his release, one of my fine missionaries during my tenure as a mission president spoke of a girl at home with whom he intended to renew association.</p>
<p>He inquired, "How will I know if she is the right one?"</p>
<p>I suggested, among other things, that he invite her to a cultural event. If she responded that this would be of no interest to her, then maybe he should pursue other alternatives. But if she had compelling spiritual qualities and could be enthralled by culture on Friday and love the athletic contest on Saturday, she might be the type of young lady he could choose as the mother for his children. It might be balanced and rewarding to be paired with her for eternity.</p>
<p>That which has been said about bringing great language, music, and literature into the home may be said with equal truth of great art - perhaps tastefully displayed in our heavenly home. It may also be said of our physical appearance and manners, as well as the order of the place in which we live, the way we offer our prayers, and the way we read Gods word.</p>
<p>I once had opportunity to visit briefly with Audrey Hepburn, the great actress of days gone by, at the time she was making the movie <i>My Fair Lady.</i> She spoke of the opening scene in the movie in which she depicted a modest, unpolished flower girl. Her face had been besmirched with charcoal to make her seem part of her surroundings. "But," she said, with a twinkle in her eye, "I was wearing my Chanel perfume. Inside I still knew I was a lady." It doesnt take expensive perfume to make a lady, but it does require cleanliness, modesty, self-respect, and pride in ones appearance.</p>
<p>Many years ago an associate of mine decided he would please his wife by sharing with her a very specific compliment each night as he arrived home. One night he praised her cooking. A second night he thanked her for excellence in housekeeping. A third night he acknowledged her fine influence on the children. The fourth night, before he could speak, she said: "I know what you are doing. I thank you for it. But dont say any of those things. Just tell me you think I am beautiful."</p>
<p>She expressed an important need that she had. Women ought to be praised for all the gifts they possess that so unselfishly add to the richness of our lives, including their attentiveness to their personal appearance. We must not "let ourselves go" and become so casual - even sloppy - in our appearance that we distance ourselves from the beauty heaven has given us. Every man has the right to be married to a woman who makes herself as beautiful as she can be and who looks in the mirror to tidy herself up before he comes home. Every woman has a right to be married to a man who keeps himself clean, physically as well as morally, and takes pride in his appearance. A husband should hurry home because of the angel who awaits him, and that angel should be watching the clock awaiting his arrival.</p>
<p>Occasionally a young man comes home from his mission and hastens to distance himself in appearance from everything associated with missionary service. He becomes slovenly. Heaven blushes. The young man who wants an exemplary spouse needs to look in the mirror and ask why she would want him. Then he should shave and press his clothes.</p>
<p>Years ago I attended a stake conference in California at which the wife of the stake president shared this story: She had been born considerably after the other children in the family, and her father was unusually protective of her. When a suitor would stop by to pick her up for a date, the father would look him over very carefully and then say: "Do you want to date my princess? Go home and wash your car and shine your shoes. Then I will give my permission." I sometimes wonder if our Heavenly Father whispers the same when we date His precious daughters. The Book of Mormon speaks of a people who "did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>There are those who flippantly say: "How I look has nothing to do with how God feels about me." But it is possible for both earthly and heavenly parents to have unspoken disappointment in their offspring without diminished love. I say it again: Sometimes heaven blushes but loves on.</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the Church, owned few things, but he took care of them. He was fastidious in his appearance. He pressed his dollar bills to remove the wrinkles. He allowed none but himself to pack his overnight bag. He knew where every article, nut, and bolt of the household was, and each had its place.</p>
<p>Would this be true of the environment in which you live? Is it a house of order? Need you dust, clean, and rearrange before you invite the Spirit of the Lord into your apartment? President Lorenzo Snow said: "The Lord does not intend that the Saints shall live always in dens and caves of the earth, but that they shall build fine houses. When the Lord comes he will not expect to meet a dirty people, but a people of refinement."<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>David Starr Jordan, a former president of Stanford University, wrote:</p>
<p><i>To be vulgar is to do that which is not the best of its kind. It is to do poor things in poor ways, and to be satisfied with that. . . . It is vulgar to wear dirty linen when one is not engaged in dirty work. It is vulgar to like poor music, to read weak books, to feed on sensational newspapers, . . . to find amusement in trashy novels, to enjoy vulgar theatres, to find pleasure in cheap jokes.</i><sup>27</sup></p>
<p>I once heard a story about an imaginary king whose wife gave birth to a baby boy. The parents knew that the lad would someday inherit the kingdom. Desiring that their son be a wise king, fully familiar with the needs of the people over whom he would reign, the king and queen took the infant into the country to be raised as part of a peasant family. He was to be told nothing of his secret destiny until he became a man.</p>
<p>At the appropriate time the king and queen returned to the country to confer on their son the kingdom. They were greatly disappointed. Having been told nothing of his appointed destiny, he was exactly that which life had prepared him to be. He understood the proper care of animals and the gathering of crops, but he knew nothing of armies and palaces and courtyards and presiding. He had lost his vision.</p>
<p>It should not be difficult for you to glean the truth in this story. Another King, your Father in Heaven, has sent you away from His presence to have experiences you would not have had in your heavenly home - all in preparation for the conferral of a kingdom. He doesnt want you to lose your vision. You are children of an exalted being. You are foreordained to preside as kings and queens. You will live in a home and environment of infinite refinement and beauty, as reflected in the language, literature, art, music, and order of heaven.</p>
<p>I close with the words of President Brigham Young: "Let us . . . show to the world that we have talent and taste, and prove to the heavens that our minds are set on beauty and true excellence, so that we can become worthy to enjoy the society of angels."<sup>28</sup> Even more, that we may enjoy the refined society of heavenly parentage, for we are of the race of the gods, being children of the Most High.</p>
<p>This is my testimony and my humble supplication for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a joy for my wife, Wendy, and me to be with you, my dear brothers and sisters. From the BYU Marriott Center in Utah, we are broadcasting to many congregations throughout the world. Thanks to each of you for being with us.
We extend a special welcome to those who will soon be finishing high school and are attending a CES fireside broadcast for the first time. As you enroll in institutions of higher learning and continue your education, I hope you will participate in institute classes so that you may have this strong spiritual resource to balance your secular learning. You will also have opportunities to attend future CES firesides such as this. Take advantage of those occasions. They will enlighten and encourage you.
The title of my message tonight is "Power and Protection Provided by Worthy Music." This topic is especially applicable to young adults. As you know, people of your age have made many significant contributions as writers, composers, and connoisseurs of worthy music.
Power
The power of worthy music was felt tonight as we sang these words in our opening hymn:
Come, ye children of the Lord,
Let us sing with one accord.
Let us raise a joyful strain
To our Lord who soon will reign.1
Through music we raised our voices in powerful praise and prayer.
Such a hymn provides a pattern of worship that is pleasing to God. His prophet taught us to "praise the Lord with singing, with music, . . . and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving" (D&amp;C 136:28).
I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Ogden Institute of Religion choir. Thank you, Brother Ritchie, Brother Simon, and members of the choir, for your magnificent music. It has not only honored the Lord, but it has also touched our hearts deeply.
As the choir sang "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross," I was deeply moved. The message focuses on the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Written by the English poet Isaac Watts, those words bear repetition:
When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
Forbid it, Lord! that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.
. . .
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.2
Indeed, Isaac Watts did demand much from himself. In his lifetime he wrote approximately 600 hymns. Two of his most productive years were between his graduation from school at age 20 and his taking a job teaching when he was 22. At that young age many great hymns flowed from him. Lyric</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">How fortunate we are to sing "Our Saviors Love" this morning. Two former members of the faculty, Crawford Gates and Edward Hart, collaborated in its creation. And how wonderful it is to be taught and edified by this superb Mens Choir. To be reminded of the love and mission of Jesus Christ so vividly through music is truly a blessing. The music performed as we entered this facility quietly prepared our minds and hearts to receive this blessing. I am grateful for music and for all of the arts, for they give meaning and richness to life.
A Unique Institution
We are privileged to be associated with Brigham Young University. It was no idle dream that brought Brigham Young Academy into existence 125 years ago. Its founders had a clear vision of its destiny. We are here today because of their courage and sacrifice.
This year the College of Fine Arts and Communications is celebrating another important event: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the College of Fine Arts. The Department of Communications was added to the college about 35 years later. In a number of ways, and on varied occasions, we are honoring those who established a foundation for the arts and communications at BYU. As a special tribute to those faithful founders, I have chosen to speak about centering the arts in Christ.
It is a rare blessing to be associated with an institution that honors the central role of Jesus Christ in this worlds destiny. It was faith in Christ that motivated the founders of this institution. And that same faith guided those who established the arts as a core element of our curriculum. They followed the Light that leads all mankind toward things that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Most were also responding to the quiet invitation of the Holy Ghost to center the arts in Christ. In Mormons words:
I judge these things of [them] because of [their] peaceable walk with the children of men.
For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also. [Moroni 7:45]
Our Challenge
I offer my profound gratitude to all those faithful, sensitive women and men who loved beauty and truth enough to sacrifice their lives in service at this institution.
It is now our challenge to strengthen and extend their artistic work into the 21st century and beyond. Will we be willing to place Christ at the center of our work?
During the ministry of Jesus in Palestine, there were many who "believed on him; but . . . did not confess him, . . . for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God" (John 12:4243). The same challenge exists today. Do we believe in Christ but fail to follow Him because we love the praise of men more than the praise of God? Or are we willing to follow Him but uncertain about wh</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">King Benjamin begins his powerful speech to his people with these words:
I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view. [Mosiah 2:9]
I quote that scripture not to set up the expectation that my address today will begin to compare to his, nor to caution you against trifling with my words, but to ask you to consider Benjamins entreaty for his people to listen not only with ears but also with hearts and minds.
You know that it is not just King Benjamin who uses these words. Many other prophets throughout scripture make frequent reference to, and coupling of, heartand mind. Often, especially in the Book of Mormon, the reference is a caution against hard hearts and blinded minds, but there are other references, some of which I will quote later, that encourage open minds and soft hearts as we strive to live the gospel.
The need for coupling minds that think, reason, and evaluate with hearts that perceive, feel, and experience has been on my mind a great deal, especially these last months. In fact, when I was asked to give this devotional address, the issue I wanted to consider was immediately clear to me.
One month from now the forty members of this past years edition of Brigham Young University Singers will reunite here for a week of intense rehearsals before departing for Australia, where we will be the United States representative to the Fourth International Choral Symposium. We will sing three concerts at the symposium, the first of which is to take place in the Sydney Opera House. You can imagine how a sense of intimidation has tried to overwhelm us in this opportunity to bring the name of Brigham Young University to this astute international gathering.
But we have countered such misgivings with a commitment to prepare ourselves for performances that are full of heart and mind, performances that will not only have the capacity to be aesthetically challenging and satisfying but also to bring the Spirit into the willing hearts and minds of those who listen.
I am gratified when issues of professional growth relate to an increase in knowledge of - and ability to live - the principles of the gospel. Music and gospel living are both very important to me. And as I speak, in this university community setting, from my expertise in music, I hope you will consider the parallels I attempt to establish between good music-making and gospel living - and then draw your own personal conclusions that will help you integrate, organize, and perhaps even simplify the important facets of your lives.
Just a moment ago you heard Veronica and Kaarin sing a beautiful American hymn that became much more meaningful to me as I learned its history.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am particularly appreciative of the music weve just heard, and quote from section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants:
For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads. [D&amp;C 25:12]
I very anxiously lay claim to those blessings from these righteous young men and women who have sung so beautifully this sacred hymn of Zion. My gratitude to them will, Im sure, be more obvious when I move into the message that I have chosen to speak upon tonight.
I want to respond to a question that I face with some frequency. It has many variations, but the theme is this: Why do we not have more inspired and inspiring music in the Church? Or why do we have so few great paintings or sculptures depicting the Restoration? Why is it when we need a new painting for a bureau of information, or perhaps for a temple, frequently nonmember painters receive the commission? The same questions have an application to poetry, to drama, to dance, to creative writing, to all the fine arts.
Now, Im sure there are those who will say, "Why does he presume to talk about that? He is uninformed. He is just out of his province." It may comfort them to know that I know that. My credentials to speak do not come from being a musician, for Im not. I am not a composer, nor a conductor, and certainly I am not a vocalist. I cannot, for example, play the piano. I would be very unwilling to do so. However, should I be pressed to it, I could, without much difficulty, prove my point. I am not adequate as an artist, nor as a sculptor, a poet, or a writer.
But then I do not intend to train you in any of those fields. My credentials, if I have any (some of them should be obvious), relate to spiritual things.
I hope for sufficient inspiration to comment on how the Spirit of the Lord influences or is influenced by the art forms that I have mentioned. Since I have been interested in these matters, I have, over the years, listened very carefully when they have been discussed by the Brethren. I have studied expressions of my Brethren and of those who have led us in times past, in order to determine how those questions should be answered.
The reason we have not yet produced a greater heritage in art and literature and music and drama is not, I am very certain, because we have not had talented people. For over the years we have had not only good ones but great ones. Some have reached great heights in their chosen fields. But few have captured the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the restoration of it in music, in art, in literature. They have not, therefore, even though they were gifted, made a lasting contribution to the onrolling of the Church and kingdom of God in the dispensation of the fulness of times. They have therefore missed doing what they might have done, and they have missed being what they might have bec</span>
