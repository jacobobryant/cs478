  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="When Mary Magdalene and "the other Mary" arrived at the empty tomb, they were greeted by an angel of the Lord who told them to "go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead."&lt;sup&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt;Matthew, in chapter 28, goes on to state, "They departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did &lt;i&gt;run&lt;/i&gt; to bring his disciples word."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Within a short period of time, we presume (remember, they were running), the message had been delivered, and the 11 disciples were again reunited with their Lord and Master. It was then that the Savior of the world gave His first postresurrection commandment to his disciples. He told them:

&lt;i&gt;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

He didnt tell them to visit with their neighbors or to try to tract out their communities; rather, he told them to go and "teach &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; nations." I wonder if those 11 disciples or the other followers of Christ at the time stopped and asked either verbally or at least in their own minds and hearts, "So, how are we going to do this? We have these little fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee, and we dont mind walking a distance or maybe riding a donkey or a camel to a neighboring village, but, really, were supposed to teach &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; nations?"

Now lets fast-forward about 1,800 years. Tomorrow, April 6, marks a special anniversary for Latter-day Saints, as it was on that day that the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered with a small group in a farmhouse in western New York and organized the Church of Jesus Christ. Imagine how those six charter Church members must have felt when Joseph told them, "And, by the way, were going to take this gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world." If they stopped to consider what he was saying, can you imagine how overwhelming and perhaps even unrealistic that charge must have felt to them and perhaps even to Joseph himself?

The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants states that "the voice of warning shall be unto &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; people" - not just to the followers of Joseph Smith, not just to the small gathering of Saints assembled at that special conference in 1831 where this particular revelation was given, but to "&lt;i&gt;all people.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

In the first and second verses at the beginning of the Doctrine and Covenants - verses that have become meaningful for me and my colleagues at BYU Broadcasting - the Lord stated:

&lt;i&gt;Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

In our world today it is easy for us, with our instantaneous access to modern technology, to comprehend at least some of the ways the admonition of the Savior to His disciples or to the early Saints through the Prophet Joseph can now be - and is beginning to be - fulfilled.

In earlier times word traveled person-to-person or through written epistles. If someone needed a message to arrive quickly, they could run, or perhaps they could ride a horse or employ some other form of transportation that by todays standards would seem slow and primitive. If a message needed to reach a large group, they could speak from a hillside, or they could erect towers or cause that copies of the message be painstakingly handwritten and distributed. Think of King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon and the tower he built and stood upon so his people could hear his voice.

Obviously, such methods of communication pale by comparison to what we are able to do today. In fact, the marvels of what were able to do today are so instantaneous and commonplace that some of us may miss the miracles most of us hold in our hands.

Those gathered in this assembly today have almost certainly seen the new BYU Broadcasting Building just east of the Marriott Center. It is the home of the radio and television channels and the broadcast-related Web sites operated by the university. For those who may be watching this address on television or the Internet, either in the United States or elsewhere in the world, this new building is the home of the channel you are watching right now: BYUtv. This mornings devotional is being transmitted instantaneously to over 180 countries of the world via BYUtv.

Likewise, as was explained by Elder Neil L. Andersen, this past weekends general conference was simultaneously translated into 93 languages and instantaneously transmitted to the four corners of the earth via television, radio, and satellite transmission and on the Internet via lds.org, byutv.org, the Mormon Channel, and a host of other digital platforms. As described in a recent &lt;i&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/i&gt; article, 29 of the 93 languages were actually translated from other countries as interpreters received the live audio transmitted from Salt Lake City as the conference was taking place. From far-flung foreign lands they translated the talks and then instantly sent their translations back over the Internet to Salt Lake City, where the audio was married to the video and then, again, instantly beamed out to the countries of the world where that particular language was needed. All this took place during a live broadcast - all in a matter of seconds.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; The technology behind so much of what we are so used to is indeed remarkable and miraculous.

In 1947, when the technology of television reached less than one-half of 1 percent of the homes in the United States, President George Albert Smith said:

&lt;i&gt;Before us is the magic of television and a host of other remarkable discoveries.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We ought to regard these inventions as blessings from the Lord. They greatly enlarge our abilities. They can indeed become blessings if we utilize them in righteousness for the dissemination of truth and the furtherance of the work of the Lord among men.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

And in 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball said:

&lt;i&gt;King Benjamin "caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them." (Mosiah 2:7.)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Our Father in heaven has now provided&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mighty towers - radio and television towers with possibilities beyond comprehension - to help fulfill the words of the Lord that "the sound must go forth from this place into all the world"&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 58:64].&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/10/when-the-world-will-be-converted?lang=eng&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;"I am confident," President Kimball said, "that the only way we can reach most of these millions of our Fathers children is through the spoken word over the airwaves."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

I believe what prophets, seers, and revelators since the dawn of the Restoration have said: that the Lord has inspired good men and women throughout the ages - inventors, scientists, philosophers, and explorers - in ways that would lead to the furtherance of His work.

Allow me to share with you just a few moments in the timeline of technology and the Church of Jesus Christ and this university. I start with the employment of the movable type printing press, which allowed the Bible and then the Book of Mormon to be printed in mass as a testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ and the Restoration of the gospel.

It was in October 1861 that the first transcontinental telegraph message was transmitted in the United States, having been sent by none other than the namesake of this university, Brigham Young. It was just two days later that the Pony Express system was deemed obsolete and ceased to operate. Indeed, the new technology of the telegraph had changed the world for those living at that time.

In 1897 the earliest audio recording was made of a president of the Church when Wilford Woodruffs voice and testimony were recorded on a wax cylinder.

On May 6, 1922, President Heber J. Grant delivered the first Church message broadcast on the first radio station in Utah, KZN - which we now all enjoy as KSL. It was that same year, 1922, that the first radio station owned by the Church was established. It was an experimental radio station operated by none other than the physics department here at Brigham Young University. Two years later, in October 1924, general conference was broadcast for the first time on radio. And in July 1929, the Tabernacle Choirs weekly &lt;i&gt;Music and the Spoken Word&lt;/i&gt; broadcasts began, which continue today in what is now the longest continuously running broadcast program in the history of radio. I would also note that in each of these instances our prophets were on the cutting edge of using emerging technologies to take the gospel to "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

There certainly are many other mileposts on this timeline, but in the interest of our time this morning, I will fast-forward to a time when I was just a little younger than most of you. I remember fondly being a young Aaronic Priesthood holder in the mid-1970s and sitting with my father in our chapel in Virginia listening to the priesthood sessions of general conference, which were piped in via a telephone line that someone had dialed in to Salt Lake City and hooked up to the loud speakers in the chapel.

It may seem a little out of sequence here, but I would be remiss and later questioned by my colleagues if I did not mention in this timeline of technology in the Church and the university the earliest days of KBYU-FM, which last year celebrated its 50th anniversary; KBYU-TV, which went on the air in 1965; BYUtv in 2000; and BYUtv International, which went on the air in 2007 in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

We could go on and talk of the first satellite broadcasts of the Church or of how the Church has embraced the Internet, including the Churchs YouTube channel and Facebook pages for the various programs and departments of the Church and the university.

It has been intentional, of course, that Ive spent the first half of my talk extolling the virtues of the technologies before us as miracles and blessings from a loving Heavenly Father. But, as we all know from scripture mastery, there "must needs be . . . an opposition in all things,"&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and we have likewise been warned by prophets, seers, and revelators that the adversary is embracing these exact same technologies to fulfill his purposes.

Elder Russell M. Nelson, in his last conference address, spoke of this truth when he said:

&lt;i&gt;The forces of evil will ever be in opposition to the forces of good. Satan constantly strives to influence us to follow his ways and make us miserable, even as he is&lt;/i&gt; [see 2 Nephi 2:27].&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/face-the-future-with-faith?lang=eng&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In the same general conference, President Thomas S. Monson said:

&lt;i&gt;The moral compass of the masses has gradually shifted to an "almost anything goes" position. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and its growing ever wider.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Many movies and television shows portray behavior which is in direct opposition to the laws of God. Do not subject yourself to the innuendo and outright filth which are so often found there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/priesthood-power?lang=eng&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Similar warnings and cautions have been given in past conferences and in other materials from the Brethren, such as the &lt;i&gt;For the Strength of Youth&lt;/i&gt; booklet. Weve been cautioned regarding the Internet, movies, music, video games, online chat and social media sites, and the many other forms of media available to us today.

I suspect that many, or perhaps even most of you, know of someone who once carried with them a wonderful spirit, but because of letting their guard down and being influenced by the side of the media that is not "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy,"&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; they lost the light they once carried with them. Some who have been overtaken by the darker side of these technological marvels have withdrawn from their families and loved ones, let their careers or schoolwork suffer, and turned from those things that once made them truly happy.

And so for the next few minutes Id like to share with you just a few of the things we might do to keep us from falling into the adversarys technological trap. I will focus on three main strategies that mirror the strategies we are using to expand the reach of BYU Broadcasting to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people:

1. Decide today, right now, who you would like to be and whether your actions and the decisions you are making today are leading you &lt;i&gt;toward&lt;/i&gt; your goal or &lt;i&gt;away from&lt;/i&gt; it. I refer to this step with the question "Whats your tagline?"

2. Conduct a self-assessment of your own consumption of media, or, in other words, ask yourself, "Whats on my playlist?"

3. Become anxiously and actively engaged in using technologies for good. Ask yourself, "Whats my role in all of this?"

First, whats your tagline? I encourage you to decide today who you would like to be and whether your decisions and actions are leading you toward or away from your goal. This, of course, is true not just for decisions you make regarding your media consumption - but, for the moment, lets consider it in that light.

In the broadcast industry, media and television networks often use taglines, usually for branding or marketing purposes, but occasionally as corporate mission statements. Most use taglines because they define how the networks want us, the viewers, to think of them. I suspect most of you could tell me, without even thinking, the tagline for ESPN: "The Worldwide Leader in Sports." TBS uses "Very Funny," and in the 1990s NBC rolled out "Must-See TV." BYUtvs tagline is "See the Good in the World." We use this tagline as the guiding principle for our programming decisions.

So, I ask you, what is your tagline? What would you like it to be? As you are considering this, you might also ask yourself, "What would my friends, family members, and associates say is my tagline? Would they agree that the television programs I watch, the music I listen to, the Internet sites I visit, and the conversations in which I engage reflect the tagline for which I wish to be known?"

Im particularly fond of the tagline the youth of the Church are aligning themselves with this year as theyve adopted the thirteenth article of faith as their Mutual theme. BYU Broadcasting likewise is trying to model its programming after this theme:

&lt;i&gt;We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. . . . If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

Second, conduct a self-assessment of your own consumption of media, or ask yourself, using the terminology of todays generation, "Whats on my playlist?"

As you decide on a tagline, you then need to assess whether the decisions you are making around media are compatible with your tagline. In other words, is your tagline credible when weighed against your playlist? When referring to your playlists, Im not just talking about your iPods or MP3 players, although they would certainly be included. Your playlist would include all of the daily decisions you make.

President Cecil O. Samuelson, in his opening devotional of winter semester this year, shared a quote from President David O. McKay regarding self-mastery and personal character, and then he said:

&lt;i&gt;While President McKay did not live during the time of the Internet, texting, tweeting, reality television, MP3 players, or social networking, the principles he taught are just as vital today as they were in the twentieth century. We all know the blessings of appropriate self-control and the heartache attached to addictions or indiscretions of every kind. Just like King Benjamin, we cant list all the ways we need to practice self-control, but King Benjamins advice is also absolutely timely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/cecil-o-samuelson_seven-suggestions/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And then President Samuelson quoted the closing verses of one of my favorite chapters in the Book of Mormon - as it is, in my opinion, the perfect blueprint for how we should live our lives:

&lt;i&gt;And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Several years ago I was visiting with a friend - Dale Andersen - from Mesa, Arizona. At the time Dale was serving as a stake president in Mesa, and he shared a personal experience with me that, with his permission, Id like to share with you this morning. He said:

&lt;i&gt;I was preparing for our stake conference and having a bit of a stupor of thought on what I should share with the members of my stake. On the Friday night prior to conference I had a most peculiar dream - one of those dreams that was as real as any experience I have ever had while awake.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I dreamed I was at a family reunion with my entire family - my wife, my children, and my grandchildren. We were all gathered in the backyard of our home and enjoying a wonderful spring afternoon together.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then I saw a most amazing and beautiful sight. It was a flock of blackbirds - but not an ordinary flock of blackbirds. This was one of those flocks that must have had tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of birds, all flying gracefully in perfect unison.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The birds would dart one direction, and then, as if cued by their leader, theyd immediately dart the other direction. Not a bird missed a beat. I stood there with my family - eyes transfixed. It was beautiful and captivating.&lt;/i&gt;

President Andersen continued:

&lt;i&gt;As we watched this spectacle, the birds came closer and closer to us. It was all very exciting to see. And as we watched, we noticed the birds were pairing off two by two, and it appeared as though they were landing in the yards of all of the homes in my neighborhood. I thought this was rather peculiar. And then, as they got closer to my own backyard, the scene began to come into focus, and I realized in an instant that these were not blackbirds after all. These were dark, evil spirits!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Immediately I panicked and yelled to my family to run into the house and to lock the doors and windows. I was frantically trying to make sure all the members of my family were accounted for and safe - my sweetheart, my children, and their children. We ran through the house slamming the windows and shutting the doors and locking them tight. I gathered everyone together in our family room, where we would be safe, but then, as I turned around, there they were. I found myself standing between these two terribly evil beings and my precious family.&lt;/i&gt;

President Andersen said:

&lt;i&gt;A window had been left ajar in the basement, and they had found their way into our home.&lt;/i&gt;

You know and I know that the adversary and his evil spirits are descending upon our families and trying to find their way into our homes, our apartments, and our dorms. At first they appear to be beautiful, enticing, and captivating - even to the point that, if we are not careful, our families will stand right in their path gazing upon them as though we were extending an open invitation to them to enter our homes.

So again I would ask that you consider the question "Whats on my playlist?"

Third, become actively engaged in using technologies for good. In His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior taught:

&lt;i&gt;Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

At BYU Broadcasting and with most every other media organization in the world, we know that television and media in general are no longer "push technologies" for a passive viewing experience. Todays audiences want to be engaged. They want to participate in the conversation.

To illustrate this point, I would like to conduct a little object lesson. Those of you here today with a portable digital device, will you please hold it up? Cell phones, iPhones, iPads, laptops - any portable device that connects you to others. Of course, most of those in attendance would fall into this category. If such a request had been made when I was a student at BYU, not a single hand would have gone up.

Students as young as elementary and junior high school age, but more frequently high school and college-age students, including many of our students here at BYU, are very much engaged in the worldwide online community.

You are building your own Web sites, iPhone and iPad apps, and other digital and social media applications. You are shooting, editing, and uploading videos to your own Web sites and other public sites like YouTube. As we heard two weeks ago from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who joined us at BYU for a special technology forum, over 500 million people, including most of you, now have a Facebook account.

Speaking at graduation exercises at BYUHawaii, Elder M. Russell Ballard encouraged BYU students to not just see the good but to do the good. He told them to "join the conversation by participating on the Internet."&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;i&gt;How different the world is today. . . . If you read newspapers, the chances are you read them on the Internet. Ours is the world of cyberspace, cell phones that capture video, video and music downloads, social networks, text messaging and blogs, handhelds and podcasts. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There are conversations going on about the Church constantly. Those conversations will continue whether or not we choose to participate in them. But we cannot stand on the sidelines while others, including our critics, attempt to define what the Church teaches.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And in the Sunday morning session of the April 2011 general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf told us:

&lt;i&gt;With so many social media resources and a multitude of more or less useful gadgets at our disposal, sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far-reaching than ever before. . . . Perhaps the Lords encouragement to "open [your] mouths"&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 60:2] &lt;i&gt;might today include "use your hands" to blog and text-message the gospel to all the world! . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . With the blessings of modern technology, we can express gratitude and joy about Gods great plan for His children in a way that can be heard not only around our workplace but around the world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus?lang=eng&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Brothers and sisters, you are the light of the world and the future mileposts in the timeline of technology. May we recognize a loving Heavenly Fathers hand in the miracles of the technologies around us and remember that He gave them to us to bless us and our families and to advance His purposes. May we hold strong to the taglines and playlists that we wish to be known for, and may we be actively engaged in the cause of truth as we seek not only to see the good but to be the good and to do the good. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>When Mary Magdalene and "the other Mary" arrived at the empty tomb, they were greeted by an angel of the Lord who told them to "go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead."<sup>1 </sup>Matthew, in chapter 28, goes on to state, "They departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did <i>run</i> to bring his disciples word."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Within a short period of time, we presume (remember, they were running), the message had been delivered, and the 11 disciples were again reunited with their Lord and Master. It was then that the Savior of the world gave His first postresurrection commandment to his disciples. He told them:</p>
<p><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i></p>
<p><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>He didnt tell them to visit with their neighbors or to try to tract out their communities; rather, he told them to go and "teach <i>all</i> nations." I wonder if those 11 disciples or the other followers of Christ at the time stopped and asked either verbally or at least in their own minds and hearts, "So, how are we going to do this? We have these little fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee, and we dont mind walking a distance or maybe riding a donkey or a camel to a neighboring village, but, really, were supposed to teach <i>all</i> nations?"</p>
<p>Now lets fast-forward about 1,800 years. Tomorrow, April 6, marks a special anniversary for Latter-day Saints, as it was on that day that the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered with a small group in a farmhouse in western New York and organized the Church of Jesus Christ. Imagine how those six charter Church members must have felt when Joseph told them, "And, by the way, were going to take this gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world." If they stopped to consider what he was saying, can you imagine how overwhelming and perhaps even unrealistic that charge must have felt to them and perhaps even to Joseph himself?</p>
<p>The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants states that "the voice of warning shall be unto <i>all</i> people" - not just to the followers of Joseph Smith, not just to the small gathering of Saints assembled at that special conference in 1831 where this particular revelation was given, but to "<i>all people.</i>"<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>In the first and second verses at the beginning of the Doctrine and Covenants - verses that have become meaningful for me and my colleagues at BYU Broadcasting - the Lord stated:</p>
<p><i>Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</i></p>
<p><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</i><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In our world today it is easy for us, with our instantaneous access to modern technology, to comprehend at least some of the ways the admonition of the Savior to His disciples or to the early Saints through the Prophet Joseph can now be - and is beginning to be - fulfilled.</p>
<p>In earlier times word traveled person-to-person or through written epistles. If someone needed a message to arrive quickly, they could run, or perhaps they could ride a horse or employ some other form of transportation that by todays standards would seem slow and primitive. If a message needed to reach a large group, they could speak from a hillside, or they could erect towers or cause that copies of the message be painstakingly handwritten and distributed. Think of King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon and the tower he built and stood upon so his people could hear his voice.</p>
<p>Obviously, such methods of communication pale by comparison to what we are able to do today. In fact, the marvels of what were able to do today are so instantaneous and commonplace that some of us may miss the miracles most of us hold in our hands.</p>
<p>Those gathered in this assembly today have almost certainly seen the new BYU Broadcasting Building just east of the Marriott Center. It is the home of the radio and television channels and the broadcast-related Web sites operated by the university. For those who may be watching this address on television or the Internet, either in the United States or elsewhere in the world, this new building is the home of the channel you are watching right now: BYUtv. This mornings devotional is being transmitted instantaneously to over 180 countries of the world via BYUtv.</p>
<p>Likewise, as was explained by Elder Neil L. Andersen, this past weekends general conference was simultaneously translated into 93 languages and instantaneously transmitted to the four corners of the earth via television, radio, and satellite transmission and on the Internet via lds.org, byutv.org, the Mormon Channel, and a host of other digital platforms. As described in a recent <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> article, 29 of the 93 languages were actually translated from other countries as interpreters received the live audio transmitted from Salt Lake City as the conference was taking place. From far-flung foreign lands they translated the talks and then instantly sent their translations back over the Internet to Salt Lake City, where the audio was married to the video and then, again, instantly beamed out to the countries of the world where that particular language was needed. All this took place during a live broadcast - all in a matter of seconds.<sup>6</sup> The technology behind so much of what we are so used to is indeed remarkable and miraculous.</p>
<p>In 1947, when the technology of television reached less than one-half of 1 percent of the homes in the United States, President George Albert Smith said:</p>
<p><i>Before us is the magic of television and a host of other remarkable discoveries.</i></p>
<p><i>We ought to regard these inventions as blessings from the Lord. They greatly enlarge our abilities. They can indeed become blessings if we utilize them in righteousness for the dissemination of truth and the furtherance of the work of the Lord among men.</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>And in 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p><i>King Benjamin "caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them." (Mosiah 2:7.)</i></p>
<p><i>Our Father in heaven has now provided</i> <i>us</i> <i>mighty towers - radio and television towers with possibilities beyond comprehension - to help fulfill the words of the Lord that "the sound must go forth from this place into all the world"</i> [D&amp;C 58:64].<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/10/when-the-world-will-be-converted?lang=eng"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><i></i>"I am confident," President Kimball said, "that the only way we can reach most of these millions of our Fathers children is through the spoken word over the airwaves."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>I believe what prophets, seers, and revelators since the dawn of the Restoration have said: that the Lord has inspired good men and women throughout the ages - inventors, scientists, philosophers, and explorers - in ways that would lead to the furtherance of His work.</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you just a few moments in the timeline of technology and the Church of Jesus Christ and this university. I start with the employment of the movable type printing press, which allowed the Bible and then the Book of Mormon to be printed in mass as a testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ and the Restoration of the gospel.</p>
<p>It was in October 1861 that the first transcontinental telegraph message was transmitted in the United States, having been sent by none other than the namesake of this university, Brigham Young. It was just two days later that the Pony Express system was deemed obsolete and ceased to operate. Indeed, the new technology of the telegraph had changed the world for those living at that time.</p>
<p>In 1897 the earliest audio recording was made of a president of the Church when Wilford Woodruffs voice and testimony were recorded on a wax cylinder.</p>
<p>On May 6, 1922, President Heber J. Grant delivered the first Church message broadcast on the first radio station in Utah, KZN - which we now all enjoy as KSL. It was that same year, 1922, that the first radio station owned by the Church was established. It was an experimental radio station operated by none other than the physics department here at Brigham Young University. Two years later, in October 1924, general conference was broadcast for the first time on radio. And in July 1929, the Tabernacle Choirs weekly <i>Music and the Spoken Word</i> broadcasts began, which continue today in what is now the longest continuously running broadcast program in the history of radio. I would also note that in each of these instances our prophets were on the cutting edge of using emerging technologies to take the gospel to "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>There certainly are many other mileposts on this timeline, but in the interest of our time this morning, I will fast-forward to a time when I was just a little younger than most of you. I remember fondly being a young Aaronic Priesthood holder in the mid-1970s and sitting with my father in our chapel in Virginia listening to the priesthood sessions of general conference, which were piped in via a telephone line that someone had dialed in to Salt Lake City and hooked up to the loud speakers in the chapel.</p>
<p>It may seem a little out of sequence here, but I would be remiss and later questioned by my colleagues if I did not mention in this timeline of technology in the Church and the university the earliest days of KBYU-FM, which last year celebrated its 50th anniversary; KBYU-TV, which went on the air in 1965; BYUtv in 2000; and BYUtv International, which went on the air in 2007 in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>
<p>We could go on and talk of the first satellite broadcasts of the Church or of how the Church has embraced the Internet, including the Churchs YouTube channel and Facebook pages for the various programs and departments of the Church and the university.</p>
<p>It has been intentional, of course, that Ive spent the first half of my talk extolling the virtues of the technologies before us as miracles and blessings from a loving Heavenly Father. But, as we all know from scripture mastery, there "must needs be . . . an opposition in all things,"<sup>11</sup> and we have likewise been warned by prophets, seers, and revelators that the adversary is embracing these exact same technologies to fulfill his purposes.</p>
<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson, in his last conference address, spoke of this truth when he said:</p>
<p><i>The forces of evil will ever be in opposition to the forces of good. Satan constantly strives to influence us to follow his ways and make us miserable, even as he is</i> [see 2 Nephi 2:27].<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/face-the-future-with-faith?lang=eng"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In the same general conference, President Thomas S. Monson said:</p>
<p><i>The moral compass of the masses has gradually shifted to an "almost anything goes" position. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and its growing ever wider.</i></p>
<p><i>Many movies and television shows portray behavior which is in direct opposition to the laws of God. Do not subject yourself to the innuendo and outright filth which are so often found there.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/priesthood-power?lang=eng"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Similar warnings and cautions have been given in past conferences and in other materials from the Brethren, such as the <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> booklet. Weve been cautioned regarding the Internet, movies, music, video games, online chat and social media sites, and the many other forms of media available to us today.</p>
<p>I suspect that many, or perhaps even most of you, know of someone who once carried with them a wonderful spirit, but because of letting their guard down and being influenced by the side of the media that is not "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy,"<sup>14</sup> they lost the light they once carried with them. Some who have been overtaken by the darker side of these technological marvels have withdrawn from their families and loved ones, let their careers or schoolwork suffer, and turned from those things that once made them truly happy.</p>
<p>And so for the next few minutes Id like to share with you just a few of the things we might do to keep us from falling into the adversarys technological trap. I will focus on three main strategies that mirror the strategies we are using to expand the reach of BYU Broadcasting to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people:</p>
<p>1. Decide today, right now, who you would like to be and whether your actions and the decisions you are making today are leading you <i>toward</i> your goal or <i>away from</i> it. I refer to this step with the question "Whats your tagline?"</p>
<p>2. Conduct a self-assessment of your own consumption of media, or, in other words, ask yourself, "Whats on my playlist?"</p>
<p>3. Become anxiously and actively engaged in using technologies for good. Ask yourself, "Whats my role in all of this?"</p>
<p>First, whats your tagline? I encourage you to decide today who you would like to be and whether your decisions and actions are leading you toward or away from your goal. This, of course, is true not just for decisions you make regarding your media consumption - but, for the moment, lets consider it in that light.</p>
<p>In the broadcast industry, media and television networks often use taglines, usually for branding or marketing purposes, but occasionally as corporate mission statements. Most use taglines because they define how the networks want us, the viewers, to think of them. I suspect most of you could tell me, without even thinking, the tagline for ESPN: "The Worldwide Leader in Sports." TBS uses "Very Funny," and in the 1990s NBC rolled out "Must-See TV." BYUtvs tagline is "See the Good in the World." We use this tagline as the guiding principle for our programming decisions.</p>
<p>So, I ask you, what is your tagline? What would you like it to be? As you are considering this, you might also ask yourself, "What would my friends, family members, and associates say is my tagline? Would they agree that the television programs I watch, the music I listen to, the Internet sites I visit, and the conversations in which I engage reflect the tagline for which I wish to be known?"</p>
<p>Im particularly fond of the tagline the youth of the Church are aligning themselves with this year as theyve adopted the thirteenth article of faith as their Mutual theme. BYU Broadcasting likewise is trying to model its programming after this theme:</p>
<p><i>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. . . . If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Second, conduct a self-assessment of your own consumption of media, or ask yourself, using the terminology of todays generation, "Whats on my playlist?"</p>
<p>As you decide on a tagline, you then need to assess whether the decisions you are making around media are compatible with your tagline. In other words, is your tagline credible when weighed against your playlist? When referring to your playlists, Im not just talking about your iPods or MP3 players, although they would certainly be included. Your playlist would include all of the daily decisions you make.</p>
<p>President Cecil O. Samuelson, in his opening devotional of winter semester this year, shared a quote from President David O. McKay regarding self-mastery and personal character, and then he said:</p>
<p><i>While President McKay did not live during the time of the Internet, texting, tweeting, reality television, MP3 players, or social networking, the principles he taught are just as vital today as they were in the twentieth century. We all know the blessings of appropriate self-control and the heartache attached to addictions or indiscretions of every kind. Just like King Benjamin, we cant list all the ways we need to practice self-control, but King Benjamins advice is also absolutely timely.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/cecil-o-samuelson_seven-suggestions/"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>And then President Samuelson quoted the closing verses of one of my favorite chapters in the Book of Mormon - as it is, in my opinion, the perfect blueprint for how we should live our lives:</p>
<p><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i></p>
<p><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i><sup>17</sup><i></i></p>
<p>Several years ago I was visiting with a friend - Dale Andersen - from Mesa, Arizona. At the time Dale was serving as a stake president in Mesa, and he shared a personal experience with me that, with his permission, Id like to share with you this morning. He said:</p>
<p><i>I was preparing for our stake conference and having a bit of a stupor of thought on what I should share with the members of my stake. On the Friday night prior to conference I had a most peculiar dream - one of those dreams that was as real as any experience I have ever had while awake.</i></p>
<p><i>I dreamed I was at a family reunion with my entire family - my wife, my children, and my grandchildren. We were all gathered in the backyard of our home and enjoying a wonderful spring afternoon together.</i></p>
<p><i>And then I saw a most amazing and beautiful sight. It was a flock of blackbirds - but not an ordinary flock of blackbirds. This was one of those flocks that must have had tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of birds, all flying gracefully in perfect unison.</i></p>
<p><i>The birds would dart one direction, and then, as if cued by their leader, theyd immediately dart the other direction. Not a bird missed a beat. I stood there with my family - eyes transfixed. It was beautiful and captivating.</i></p>
<p>President Andersen continued:</p>
<p><i>As we watched this spectacle, the birds came closer and closer to us. It was all very exciting to see. And as we watched, we noticed the birds were pairing off two by two, and it appeared as though they were landing in the yards of all of the homes in my neighborhood. I thought this was rather peculiar. And then, as they got closer to my own backyard, the scene began to come into focus, and I realized in an instant that these were not blackbirds after all. These were dark, evil spirits!</i></p>
<p><i>Immediately I panicked and yelled to my family to run into the house and to lock the doors and windows. I was frantically trying to make sure all the members of my family were accounted for and safe - my sweetheart, my children, and their children. We ran through the house slamming the windows and shutting the doors and locking them tight. I gathered everyone together in our family room, where we would be safe, but then, as I turned around, there they were. I found myself standing between these two terribly evil beings and my precious family.</i></p>
<p>President Andersen said:</p>
<p><i>A window had been left ajar in the basement, and they had found their way into our home.</i></p>
<p>You know and I know that the adversary and his evil spirits are descending upon our families and trying to find their way into our homes, our apartments, and our dorms. At first they appear to be beautiful, enticing, and captivating - even to the point that, if we are not careful, our families will stand right in their path gazing upon them as though we were extending an open invitation to them to enter our homes.</p>
<p>So again I would ask that you consider the question "Whats on my playlist?"</p>
<p>Third, become actively engaged in using technologies for good. In His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior taught:</p>
<p><i>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</i><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>At BYU Broadcasting and with most every other media organization in the world, we know that television and media in general are no longer "push technologies" for a passive viewing experience. Todays audiences want to be engaged. They want to participate in the conversation.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I would like to conduct a little object lesson. Those of you here today with a portable digital device, will you please hold it up? Cell phones, iPhones, iPads, laptops - any portable device that connects you to others. Of course, most of those in attendance would fall into this category. If such a request had been made when I was a student at BYU, not a single hand would have gone up.</p>
<p>Students as young as elementary and junior high school age, but more frequently high school and college-age students, including many of our students here at BYU, are very much engaged in the worldwide online community.</p>
<p>You are building your own Web sites, iPhone and iPad apps, and other digital and social media applications. You are shooting, editing, and uploading videos to your own Web sites and other public sites like YouTube. As we heard two weeks ago from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who joined us at BYU for a special technology forum, over 500 million people, including most of you, now have a Facebook account.</p>
<p>Speaking at graduation exercises at BYUHawaii, Elder M. Russell Ballard encouraged BYU students to not just see the good but to do the good. He told them to "join the conversation by participating on the Internet."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><i>How different the world is today. . . . If you read newspapers, the chances are you read them on the Internet. Ours is the world of cyberspace, cell phones that capture video, video and music downloads, social networks, text messaging and blogs, handhelds and podcasts. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>There are conversations going on about the Church constantly. Those conversations will continue whether or not we choose to participate in them. But we cannot stand on the sidelines while others, including our critics, attempt to define what the Church teaches.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>And in the Sunday morning session of the April 2011 general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf told us:</p>
<p><i>With so many social media resources and a multitude of more or less useful gadgets at our disposal, sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far-reaching than ever before. . . . Perhaps the Lords encouragement to "open [your] mouths"</i> [D&amp;C 60:2] <i>might today include "use your hands" to blog and text-message the gospel to all the world! . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . With the blessings of modern technology, we can express gratitude and joy about Gods great plan for His children in a way that can be heard not only around our workplace but around the world.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/waiting-on-the-road-to-damascus?lang=eng"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you are the light of the world and the future mileposts in the timeline of technology. May we recognize a loving Heavenly Fathers hand in the miracles of the technologies around us and remember that He gave them to us to bless us and our families and to advance His purposes. May we hold strong to the taglines and playlists that we wish to be known for, and may we be actively engaged in the cause of truth as we seek not only to see the good but to be the good and to do the good. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I was ten or eleven years old, my twin brother and I went on a hike up the mountain just north of Y Mountain. Together, with a few friends, we woke up early and climbed straight up the face and then scampered across the top to the peak overlooking Rock Canyon.
On our way back down we ran into a small rattlesnake. Being the excitable kids we were, we surrounded the poor creature and wouldnt let it escape. We became so bold as to pick it up by the tail as it would try to slither away. Wed hold it for a second or two and then drop it when our nerves gave in. The potentially deadly consequence of our actions didnt deter us from our foolishness.
When we got home, my mother asked me if everything went okay on the hike. I mumbled something about a rattlesnake. She then related to me that at about the same time we would have been fooling around with the snake, she had received a strong impression that we were in danger. She had knelt and prayed for us. I was astonished. How did she know we were in trouble? This is my earliest recollection of what has become many experiences in which my mother received specific inspiration from the Holy Ghost in the very moment she needed it. At the time it seemed mysterious to me - this idea of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. I wondered how it really worked. I understood that the Holy Ghost was a personage of spirit, but I puzzled over how He could be helping everyone at once.
Years later, during my freshman year at BYU, I found myself sitting in a Physics 122 class. One day we were discussing the theoretical limit of the speed of light - about 300,000,000 meters per second. For the non-physics majors, thats more than 670 million miles per hour.
The professor said, "It is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel." Then he paused and said, "But we know of something faster - the speed of prayer." He reasoned that if God has a body as tangible as mans, then He occupies a discreet place in the universe. And we believe we can instantaneously communicate with Him. So there must be something faster than the speed of light.
Again I found myself reflecting upon the nature of the power of the Holy Ghost. Keep in mind that this was in 1985, so there was no Internet and there were no smartphones or wireless networks that convey data all over the world to millions of people simultaneously in a matter of seconds. Today, with our current experience, it doesnt even stretch our minds to imagine technology that is capable of sending instantaneous and personalized messages to millions - even billions - of people at the same time.
Celestial Technology
Today Id like to discuss just a few of the things I have learned since my youth about the power of the Holy Ghost and the nature of truth. Obviously this wont be a complete treatise on the Holy Ghost but a personal reflection. I humbly add my t</span>

My relationship to this campus goes far beyond my current titles or even my degrees from this institution. The only word that is intimate enough yet broad enough to encompass my connection to BYU is the word home. BYU is my home. I have lived within walking distance of this very spot more than I have lived anywhere else in the world. I am a child of BYU, not just because I received an undergraduate degree from here but because I was literally a child here - living with my parents and the rest of my family in Heritage Halls during summer pilgrimages to this campus when my father was completing his PhD.
I have learned on this campus, I have grown on this campus, and I have discovered great things about myself and about you on this campus. Much of my research is dedicated to observations of your generation, and, I have to admit, you have much to be proud of. A recent column in the New York Times Magazine noted that young people today are more averse to risky behavior than their parents were at the same age. Drug and alcohol use, smoking, and sexual activity have all been in sharp decline in your demographic during the past twenty years.1 Also, financial firm TD Ameritrade believes you are more financially savvy and better savers than your parents,2 and a study conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine suggests that your willingness to improve society at large may actually improve your eating habits.3 If these are the inclinations of our culture at large, I certainly believe that these trends would only be amplified among the student body of BYU.
All of this might come as a bit of a shock to your parents, who have spent so much time and effort getting you to eat your vegetables and shielding you from evil - but it does not come as a shock to me. I watch you; I see you doing good. I am acutely aware of my responsibility to add to and not detract from the spirit that you carry.
While you certainly deserve praise and recognition, you should also recognize that your generation has its own unique characteristics and challenges. For example, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to capture and maintain your attention. I know that many of you are multitasking at this very moment - doing homework, checking your Facebook account, answering emails, texting your friends about your lunch plans, or even shopping. All of these things are available to you here in the Marriott Center through the devices that we carry in our pockets; these tools and technologies are increasingly becoming vital parts of our work, our play, our families, and our very identities.
Im addicted, too. If you would have told me at age thirty (just a little w</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Happy Valentines Day! This is a day when we celebrate love. We think of love letters and hearts, roses and chocolate. Many hope today to receive a message from one they love, and some are planning to deliver a message to one they love. I hope you wont be disappointed.
My parents loved me dearly - of that I had no doubt. But when I was ten years old, I had to attend boarding school in England while my parents continued to live thousands of miles away in Saudi Arabia. The separation was an enormous wrench for me.
On the long flight to England, I remember feeling queasy in the pit of my stomach as I left behind the heat and sunshine of Arabia, flew across the miles, and descended through multiple layers of cloud into the cold, gray scene of Londons Heathrow Airport. The rain droplets on the airplane window shot past, and I felt so very, very far from home.
I arrived at the school in my uniform of gray shorts, sweater, tie, and cap, pulling my great, green trunk of belongings behind me. The loneliness was overwhelming.
I slept in a dormitory with about fifteen other boys. It was a very foreign experience, complete with rickety, metal-framed beds and the occasional pillow fight. Every morning after making our beds, we boys would stand aside while our bed-making skills and "hospital corners" were graded. There were unfamiliar smells, unfamiliar foods, and very unfamiliar teachers. My Latin master would walk around the room and peck our heads with the tip of his ballpoint pen if we didnt know an answer. And I was very well pecked.
Out on the fields during our sports time, on a rare clear day, if a plane was flying high overhead, leaving a vapor trail, I would study its course to see if that plane might be heading back to Arabia - feeling a deep pang if it was. I longed, somehow, to jump aboard and go back home to my parents.
The brightest spot in any week came during breakfast time when mail was delivered. I would look anxiously for the telltale blue airmail letter that my mother sent faithfully every week. As the teachers came around the tables with letters to hand out, I would literally be on the edge of my bench waiting to see if one was for me. In so many senses this was Hogwarts, but without the owls and with none of the magic.
The blue airmail letters were often the highlight of my week, particularly in those early days when my loneliness was most acute. I would receive letters from home with such happiness and relief. I would wait until I could be alone to carefully unseal them and then eagerly read the messages of love, reassurance, and advice from my parents. I savored every line and felt, for those moments, closer to home and closer to my parents love, and I received the courage I needed to continue on for another week.
There is much in the natural course of mortal life that can make us feel alone and afraid, even while we are surrounded </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Prophet Joseph Smith described "a welding link" that must exist between the past, the present, and the future if we are to be made perfect along with both our ancestors and our posterity (verse 18). He refers, of course, to the offering of the ordinances of exaltation so that we can present to the Lord "a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation" (D&amp;C 128:24).
Those who have done any family history work will know the great sense of fulfillment and gratitude that comes when we can learn enough about an ancestor that she ceases to be just another name with a death date to us and is resurrected in our minds as a living human being endowed with a unique personality and all the other human traits that help us develop a connection - or a welding link - to her.
In the emotional sense, this link may be something like the "taming" process that the fox described in Antoine de Saint-Exupes classic tale The Little Prince:
To me [the fox declared], you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world. [Antoine de Saint-Exupe, The Little Prince (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1943), 66]
Once we have "tamed" our ancestors, they are unique in all the world to us, and our attachment to them grows.
But what I want to propose to you today is that there may be additional essential forms of linkage between ourselves and our loved ones of both yesterday and tomorrow. Our predecessors lived lives very different from those that we are experiencing today, and it is an absolute reality that our posterity will inhabit a world very unlike the one we know - just as my mother, who is here today, born just 15 years after the Wright Brothers took a flying leap at Kitty Hawk, sees her great-grandson Andrew growing up in a world that none of the most creative science fiction writers of her day even began to imagine.
As we ponder the Lords injunctions to us in sections 88, 90, and 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants - where we are told to diligently study "good books" (D&amp;C 90:15), history, geography, languages, peoples, and virtually every other imaginable discipline - I cant help but wonder whether the Lord in fact wants us to forge a link between the civilizations of the past and our own day and then to transmit them to our own progeny. Perhaps one of the welding links that will help each of us to be tethered more securely to our ancestors can be achieved by familiarizing ourselves with the cultures in which they were born, lived, married, wept, laughed,</span>
