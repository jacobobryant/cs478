  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear brothers and sisters. I am very grateful for the privilege accorded me to address you on the eve of the important Thanksgiving recognition we give to this Thursday’s holiday. I am confident that I am the most blessed of you all, as I have been privileged to be a member of the administrative staff of BYU for the past thirty years. It has brought important and special responsibilities to me and my family. In carrying them through, we have been blessed in many ways. To be closely associated with President Ernest L. Wilkinson, President Dallin Oaks, and now President Jeffrey R. Holland has enriched our lives. I have watched these great men work to build this university to a pinnacle of size, quality, and strength that makes possible your presence on this campus this very day. I salute them and express a deep gratitude for their excellent achievements.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gratitude a Way of Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I wish to share with you an awareness that thanksgiving should be in our hearts and expressed in our actions every day of the year, not just on 25 November 1982.

Stanley Dixon penned these most thoughtful words that were set to beautiful music like that we are hearing this hour:

&lt;i&gt;Thanks be to God for roses rare,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For skies of blue and sunshine fair.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For every gift I raise a prayer,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thanks be to God for lovely night,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For mystic fields with stars bedight,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For hours of dream and deep delight,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thanks be to God for love divine,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The hopes that ’round my heart entwine,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For all the joy that now is mine,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/i&gt;
[Stanley Dixon (New York: Associated Music Publishers)]

President N. Eldon Tanner has said, “Thanksgiving Day gives each and every one of us an invitation and a wonderful opportunity to pause and count our many blessings and to give thanks to God and praise him from whom all blessings flow” (“Thanksgiving 1968,” &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 23 November 1968, p. 9).

President Marion G. Romney, in his address in the past general conference, made us deeply aware of the principle of gratitude and thanksgiving, and I quote:

&lt;i&gt;The virtues of gratitude have been widely extolled and the sinfulness of ingratitude has been just as widely condemned.&lt;/i&gt;

He continued:

&lt;i&gt;It has been said that “an ungrateful man is like a hog under a tree eating acorns, but never looking up to see where they come from” (Timothy Dexter,&lt;/i&gt; The New Dictionary of Thoughts&lt;i&gt; [Garden City, NY: Standard Book, 1961], p. 308).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Jesus revealed his feeling about ingratitude when only one of ten lepers whom he had healed turned back and gave thanks.&lt;/i&gt; [“Gratitude and Thanksgiving,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1982, p. 49]

We can read this account in Luke 17:11–18.

Elder Bruce R. McConkie has said: “True worship includes &lt;i&gt;thanksgiving&lt;/i&gt; to God—the acknowledging and confessing with joy and gladness of the benefits and mercies which he bestows upon his children” (&lt;i&gt;MD,&lt;/i&gt; p. 788).

I submit that the thanksgiving we should acknowledge should be an everyday occurrence directed to him who created us all.

It seems appropriate to share with you the statement the First Presidency gave to the Church this past Saturday in the &lt;i&gt;Church News:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As the season of Thanksgiving approaches, it brings with it the reminder that this cherished holiday had its birth in religious faith and still finds its best expression in prayers of gratitude and repentance. For this Thanksgiving and the joyful Christmas season to follow, our counsel to all men and women everywhere is, remember the scripture injunction, “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.” (D&amp;amp;C 59:7.)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ingratitude is one of the woeful failings of our society. The failure to acknowledge the sovereignty and the beneficence of God, the refusal to bend our will to His, are at the very root of the major problems in our society.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Prayer, family prayer in the homes of people in all lands, is one of the simple medicines that would check the dread disease that robs men and women of honesty, character and integrity. In generations past, individual and family prayers, in the homes of people throughout the world were as much a part of the day’s activity as was eating. As the practice of prayer has diminished, moral decay has increased.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The inclination to be holy, to be thankful, is increased as family members kneel together and thank the Lord for life and peace and all that they may become under His guidance. In remembering together before the Lord the poor, the needy, the oppressed, there is developed, unconsciously but realistically, a love for others above self, a respect for others, a desire to serve the needs of others. One cannot ask God to help a neighbor in distress without being motivated to do something toward helping that neighbor.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What miracles would be evident if, beginning now, beginning this Thanksgiving season, we all would lay aside our own selfishness and lose ourselves in the service of others. Our prayers of Thanksgiving, this season and daily all through the year, will bring comfort to our hearts, knit us together in love, and open to us the treasures of wisdom, knowledge, gratitude and forgiveness.&lt;/i&gt; [“Express thanks in prayers and service, say Church leaders,” &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 20 November 1982, p. 3]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expression of Gratitude Important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In positive reflection I turn to doctrinal references which place special responsibilities on us all to express our gratitude to our Creator. “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.” This important commandment, found in section 59, verse 7, of the Doctrine and Covenants, is as binding upon us as any other law of God. We are commanded to do “all things with prayer and thanksgiving,” and “Ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with” (D&amp;amp;C 46:7, 32).

Now, Thanksgiving Day 1982 is soon upon us. What will we do with it? This year will it merely be a day of feasting, watching TV, or seeking pleasure?

When the day was first instituted, it was regarded as a religious observance completely in line with the commandments I just stated. The Pilgrims, it will be remembered, were grateful for their very lives; and whom did they thank? Almighty God. They knew the source of their blessings. They knew they had been preserved by a divine hand. Most of you in this assembly have been blessed with pioneer ancestors who would testify that they were preserved to arrive in these valleys because of divine intervention in their behalf.

So now, what about ourselves? Are we willing to recognize that our daily blessings are provided by other efforts than our own? The arrogance of much of mankind today merely states, “I’ve done it myself.”

I submit that our blessings flow from many, many others and through divine approbation. As an example, one of the most important things on earth, essential to our welfare, is plain, ordinary water. Did we make it? Did we pipe it into our homes? Did we make the pipe? Did we sterilize it so that it would be bacteria free? And, who provided the streams from which water comes? Who caused the rains to fall, the earth to be fertile? Who first gave us seeds to plant? Who placed cows and sheep and birds and trees on the earth?

Are we not dependent upon him and his creations? No one can measure the gratitude we owe to the Almighty as the Great Provider. No one can measure the appreciation we owe to our fellowmen, those who plant and harvest, and those who provide services on every hand. In this complex world there is a network of interdependency among us all. So many others are involved in providing for us the things which we ourselves could not provide, it is folly to ignore them. We ride in cars and planes, but did we make them? We use oil and gasoline, but from where did they come? We eat bread and drink milk for our health, but did we produce them?

When Paul wrote to Timothy about the latter days, he gave as one of the signs of the times the fact that people would become “unthankful, unholy” (2 Timothy 3:2). This is an interesting combination of words—that one with ungrateful attitudes can be unholy, their roots being in the same evil source. Ingratitude, of course, is unholy from every standpoint. It is evil in itself. Let’s turn to appreciation, gratitude, and thanks.

So, on this special Thanksgiving 1982, what will be your list of “gratitudes”?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three Reasons for Gratitude&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I desire to share just &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; of my own. Hundreds of blessings are found in each of these three for which I daily thank my Father in Heaven:

1. &lt;i&gt;My citizenship&lt;/i&gt; in this great United States of America.

2. &lt;i&gt;My membership&lt;/i&gt; in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

3. &lt;i&gt;My wife&lt;/i&gt; and family.

Now, just a brief reference to each:

1. &lt;i&gt;I love my country. &lt;/i&gt;It has been good to me. I have been pleased to serve in the U.S. Navy Reserve for thirty-four years. While I was a guest in the home of Admiral Emmet L. Tidd, in Washington, D.C., not too long ago, he shared this experience. He had just returned to Washington, D.C., following an extended trip to several major powers in the world to assess their strengths for the Chief of Naval Operations. He observed on his return that our country, with all its political, social, and economic problems, is still so &lt;i&gt;far ahead&lt;/i&gt; of whichever country might be second, he would have no second thoughts about his love for America and his faith in this great country and where he would want to reside. I feel the same way. Some outsider has said, “Your country may not be a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds.” I am blessed every day because of being a citizen in this land. Having just returned from the Mideast on university business, I can’t figure out why I was so blessed as to be assigned to be raised up and to live in this special land rather than where I have just visited, or in some other part of the world.

I am grateful for a student body expression twice each day that permits students to stand in reverence and thought each morning as the &lt;i&gt;Star Spangled Banner&lt;/i&gt; is played, and the flag is raised, and then again lowered the same way in the late afternoon. Visitors to our campus stand in awe as this is done. Some say it is old-fashioned. If so, I will take the old-fashioned way.

Where do you stand on the appreciation of this land of liberty? President David O. McKay once stated: “We are grateful for this land of America, ‘choice above all other lands.’ The freedom vouchsafed by the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to every man the right to worship . . . in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience, made possible the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” (“Thanksgiving 1968,” &lt;i&gt;Church News&lt;/i&gt;, 23 November 1968, p. 9). I am thankful for this event.

2. &lt;i&gt;I value and treasure my membership in the Church:&lt;/i&gt; I was privileged to be born in New Zealand while my parents were serving together on their first mission. How blessed I’ve been to have parents so wonderful that they have given me a royal heritage of membership in the Church. They themselves have been living examples for us to follow. They are here today. I wish them to know how much I love and appreciate them. How fortunate for me to fill a mission and thereby fortify my testimony of the Church and all it means in our lives. I will be eternally grateful for the training and leadership opportunities I have experienced through my Church assignments. What a blessing to you and to me to recognize our church’s commitment to education. We are the recipients of the privilege of this great campus. Let’s not fall short of measuring up to expectations of our respected Church and university leaders.

Yes, we are blessed through our membership in the Church. If we are faithful, these blessings have eternal application. Let’s not forget that. Is your Church membership worthy of a special thanksgiving expression?

3. &lt;i&gt;I love my wife, Nonie, and my family very much.&lt;/i&gt; I’ve been blessed with a beautiful eternal companion, together completing forty-two years last week. Busy with Church and school life these forty-two years, she jokes about having to marry me to get rid of me; but we have a relationship I would wish for all of you young marriage prospects. It isn’t easy living with a fellow like me, but we are planning on many, many more years together. Nonie is as beautiful inside as you see her on the outside. So, with three wonderful children, eleven grandchildren, and a few adopted ones, life is very sweet and worthwhile.

How does one best express thanks for all of this? I must thank a very compassionate Father in Heaven. Do you have a special reason this holiday season to feel as I do about my family?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, I recognize that my Thanksgiving expressions for country, church, and family blessings must be directed to my Father in Heaven. You have heard three of my gratitudes. What will be the gratitudes you may express to your Father in Heaven this Thanksgiving season?

Some years ago I read a simple Thanksgiving prayer:

&lt;i&gt;O, heavenly Father:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We thank Thee for food and remember the hungry.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We thank Thee for health and remember the sick.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We thank Thee for friends and remember the friendless.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We thank Thee for freedom and remember the enslaved.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;May these remembrances stir us to service&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That Thy gifts may be used for others.&lt;/i&gt; [Abigail Van Buren, “Dear Abby,” &lt;i&gt;Deseret News,&lt;/i&gt; 25 November 1976, p. 4C]

Said in another way by Wilfred A. Peterson:

&lt;i&gt;The art of thanksgiving is &lt;/i&gt;thanks living.&lt;i&gt; It is gratitude in action. It is applying Albert Schweitzer’s philosophy: “In gratitude for your own good fortune you must render in return some sacrifice of your life or other life.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It is thanking God for each new day by living it to the fullest.&lt;/i&gt;[“The Art of Thanksgiving,” &lt;i&gt;The Art of Living&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961), pp. 44–45]

My prayer for each of us is that during this Thanksgiving season we can all count our blessings in a way that truthfully says, “Thanks be to God,” in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My dear brothers and sisters. I am very grateful for the privilege accorded me to address you on the eve of the important Thanksgiving recognition we give to this Thursday’s holiday. I am confident that I am the most blessed of you all, as I have been privileged to be a member of the administrative staff of BYU for the past thirty years. It has brought important and special responsibilities to me and my family. In carrying them through, we have been blessed in many ways. To be closely associated with President Ernest L. Wilkinson, President Dallin Oaks, and now President Jeffrey R. Holland has enriched our lives. I have watched these great men work to build this university to a pinnacle of size, quality, and strength that makes possible your presence on this campus this very day. I salute them and express a deep gratitude for their excellent achievements.</p>
<h2><b>Gratitude a Way of Life</b></h2>
<p>I wish to share with you an awareness that thanksgiving should be in our hearts and expressed in our actions every day of the year, not just on 25 November 1982.</p>
<p>Stanley Dixon penned these most thoughtful words that were set to beautiful music like that we are hearing this hour:</p>
<p><i>Thanks be to God for roses rare,</i><br />
<i>For skies of blue and sunshine fair.</i><br />
<i>For every gift I raise a prayer,</i><br />
<i>Thanks be to God.</i></p>
<p><i>Thanks be to God for lovely night,</i><br />
<i>For mystic fields with stars bedight,</i><br />
<i>For hours of dream and deep delight,</i><br />
<i>Thanks be to God.</i></p>
<p><i>Thanks be to God for love divine,</i><br />
<i>The hopes that ’round my heart entwine,</i><br />
<i>For all the joy that now is mine,</i><br />
<i>Thanks be to God.</i><br />
[Stanley Dixon (New York: Associated Music Publishers)]</p>
<p>President N. Eldon Tanner has said, “Thanksgiving Day gives each and every one of us an invitation and a wonderful opportunity to pause and count our many blessings and to give thanks to God and praise him from whom all blessings flow” (“Thanksgiving 1968,” <i>Church News,</i> 23 November 1968, p. 9).</p>
<p>President Marion G. Romney, in his address in the past general conference, made us deeply aware of the principle of gratitude and thanksgiving, and I quote:</p>
<p><i>The virtues of gratitude have been widely extolled and the sinfulness of ingratitude has been just as widely condemned.</i></p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p><i>It has been said that “an ungrateful man is like a hog under a tree eating acorns, but never looking up to see where they come from” (Timothy Dexter,</i> The New Dictionary of Thoughts<i> [Garden City, NY: Standard Book, 1961], p. 308).</i></p>
<p><i>Jesus revealed his feeling about ingratitude when only one of ten lepers whom he had healed turned back and gave thanks.</i> [“Gratitude and Thanksgiving,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 1982, p. 49]</p>
<p>We can read this account in Luke 17:11–18.</p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie has said: “True worship includes <i>thanksgiving</i> to God—the acknowledging and confessing with joy and gladness of the benefits and mercies which he bestows upon his children” (<i>MD,</i> p. 788).</p>
<p>I submit that the thanksgiving we should acknowledge should be an everyday occurrence directed to him who created us all.</p>
<p>It seems appropriate to share with you the statement the First Presidency gave to the Church this past Saturday in the <i>Church News:</i></p>
<p><i>As the season of Thanksgiving approaches, it brings with it the reminder that this cherished holiday had its birth in religious faith and still finds its best expression in prayers of gratitude and repentance. For this Thanksgiving and the joyful Christmas season to follow, our counsel to all men and women everywhere is, remember the scripture injunction, “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.” (D&amp;C 59:7.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ingratitude is one of the woeful failings of our society. The failure to acknowledge the sovereignty and the beneficence of God, the refusal to bend our will to His, are at the very root of the major problems in our society.</i></p>
<p><i>Prayer, family prayer in the homes of people in all lands, is one of the simple medicines that would check the dread disease that robs men and women of honesty, character and integrity. In generations past, individual and family prayers, in the homes of people throughout the world were as much a part of the day’s activity as was eating. As the practice of prayer has diminished, moral decay has increased.</i></p>
<p><i>The inclination to be holy, to be thankful, is increased as family members kneel together and thank the Lord for life and peace and all that they may become under His guidance. In remembering together before the Lord the poor, the needy, the oppressed, there is developed, unconsciously but realistically, a love for others above self, a respect for others, a desire to serve the needs of others. One cannot ask God to help a neighbor in distress without being motivated to do something toward helping that neighbor.</i></p>
<p><i>What miracles would be evident if, beginning now, beginning this Thanksgiving season, we all would lay aside our own selfishness and lose ourselves in the service of others. Our prayers of Thanksgiving, this season and daily all through the year, will bring comfort to our hearts, knit us together in love, and open to us the treasures of wisdom, knowledge, gratitude and forgiveness.</i> [“Express thanks in prayers and service, say Church leaders,” <i>Church News,</i> 20 November 1982, p. 3]</p>
<h2><b>Expression of Gratitude Important</b></h2>
<p>In positive reflection I turn to doctrinal references which place special responsibilities on us all to express our gratitude to our Creator. “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.” This important commandment, found in section 59, verse 7, of the Doctrine and Covenants, is as binding upon us as any other law of God. We are commanded to do “all things with prayer and thanksgiving,” and “Ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with” (D&amp;C 46:7, 32).</p>
<p>Now, Thanksgiving Day 1982 is soon upon us. What will we do with it? This year will it merely be a day of feasting, watching TV, or seeking pleasure?</p>
<p>When the day was first instituted, it was regarded as a religious observance completely in line with the commandments I just stated. The Pilgrims, it will be remembered, were grateful for their very lives; and whom did they thank? Almighty God. They knew the source of their blessings. They knew they had been preserved by a divine hand. Most of you in this assembly have been blessed with pioneer ancestors who would testify that they were preserved to arrive in these valleys because of divine intervention in their behalf.</p>
<p>So now, what about ourselves? Are we willing to recognize that our daily blessings are provided by other efforts than our own? The arrogance of much of mankind today merely states, “I’ve done it myself.”</p>
<p>I submit that our blessings flow from many, many others and through divine approbation. As an example, one of the most important things on earth, essential to our welfare, is plain, ordinary water. Did we make it? Did we pipe it into our homes? Did we make the pipe? Did we sterilize it so that it would be bacteria free? And, who provided the streams from which water comes? Who caused the rains to fall, the earth to be fertile? Who first gave us seeds to plant? Who placed cows and sheep and birds and trees on the earth?</p>
<p>Are we not dependent upon him and his creations? No one can measure the gratitude we owe to the Almighty as the Great Provider. No one can measure the appreciation we owe to our fellowmen, those who plant and harvest, and those who provide services on every hand. In this complex world there is a network of interdependency among us all. So many others are involved in providing for us the things which we ourselves could not provide, it is folly to ignore them. We ride in cars and planes, but did we make them? We use oil and gasoline, but from where did they come? We eat bread and drink milk for our health, but did we produce them?</p>
<p>When Paul wrote to Timothy about the latter days, he gave as one of the signs of the times the fact that people would become “unthankful, unholy” (2 Timothy 3:2). This is an interesting combination of words—that one with ungrateful attitudes can be unholy, their roots being in the same evil source. Ingratitude, of course, is unholy from every standpoint. It is evil in itself. Let’s turn to appreciation, gratitude, and thanks.</p>
<p>So, on this special Thanksgiving 1982, what will be your list of “gratitudes”?</p>
<h2><b>Three Reasons for Gratitude</b></h2>
<p>I desire to share just <i>three</i> of my own. Hundreds of blessings are found in each of these three for which I daily thank my Father in Heaven:</p>
<p>1. <i>My citizenship</i> in this great United States of America.</p>
<p>2. <i>My membership</i> in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>3. <i>My wife</i> and family.</p>
<p>Now, just a brief reference to each:</p>
<p>1. <i>I love my country. </i>It has been good to me. I have been pleased to serve in the U.S. Navy Reserve for thirty-four years. While I was a guest in the home of Admiral Emmet L. Tidd, in Washington, D.C., not too long ago, he shared this experience. He had just returned to Washington, D.C., following an extended trip to several major powers in the world to assess their strengths for the Chief of Naval Operations. He observed on his return that our country, with all its political, social, and economic problems, is still so <i>far ahead</i> of whichever country might be second, he would have no second thoughts about his love for America and his faith in this great country and where he would want to reside. I feel the same way. Some outsider has said, “Your country may not be a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds.” I am blessed every day because of being a citizen in this land. Having just returned from the Mideast on university business, I can’t figure out why I was so blessed as to be assigned to be raised up and to live in this special land rather than where I have just visited, or in some other part of the world.</p>
<p>I am grateful for a student body expression twice each day that permits students to stand in reverence and thought each morning as the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i> is played, and the flag is raised, and then again lowered the same way in the late afternoon. Visitors to our campus stand in awe as this is done. Some say it is old-fashioned. If so, I will take the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on the appreciation of this land of liberty? President David O. McKay once stated: “We are grateful for this land of America, ‘choice above all other lands.’ The freedom vouchsafed by the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to every man the right to worship . . . in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience, made possible the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” (“Thanksgiving 1968,” <i>Church News</i>, 23 November 1968, p. 9). I am thankful for this event.</p>
<p>2. <i>I value and treasure my membership in the Church:</i> I was privileged to be born in New Zealand while my parents were serving together on their first mission. How blessed I’ve been to have parents so wonderful that they have given me a royal heritage of membership in the Church. They themselves have been living examples for us to follow. They are here today. I wish them to know how much I love and appreciate them. How fortunate for me to fill a mission and thereby fortify my testimony of the Church and all it means in our lives. I will be eternally grateful for the training and leadership opportunities I have experienced through my Church assignments. What a blessing to you and to me to recognize our church’s commitment to education. We are the recipients of the privilege of this great campus. Let’s not fall short of measuring up to expectations of our respected Church and university leaders.</p>
<p>Yes, we are blessed through our membership in the Church. If we are faithful, these blessings have eternal application. Let’s not forget that. Is your Church membership worthy of a special thanksgiving expression?</p>
<p>3. <i>I love my wife, Nonie, and my family very much.</i> I’ve been blessed with a beautiful eternal companion, together completing forty-two years last week. Busy with Church and school life these forty-two years, she jokes about having to marry me to get rid of me; but we have a relationship I would wish for all of you young marriage prospects. It isn’t easy living with a fellow like me, but we are planning on many, many more years together. Nonie is as beautiful inside as you see her on the outside. So, with three wonderful children, eleven grandchildren, and a few adopted ones, life is very sweet and worthwhile.</p>
<p>How does one best express thanks for all of this? I must thank a very compassionate Father in Heaven. Do you have a special reason this holiday season to feel as I do about my family?</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Now, I recognize that my Thanksgiving expressions for country, church, and family blessings must be directed to my Father in Heaven. You have heard three of my gratitudes. What will be the gratitudes you may express to your Father in Heaven this Thanksgiving season?</p>
<p>Some years ago I read a simple Thanksgiving prayer:</p>
<p><i>O, heavenly Father:</i><br />
<i>We thank Thee for food and remember the hungry.</i><br />
<i>We thank Thee for health and remember the sick.</i><br />
<i>We thank Thee for friends and remember the friendless.</i><br />
<i>We thank Thee for freedom and remember the enslaved.</i><br />
<i>May these remembrances stir us to service</i><br />
<i>That Thy gifts may be used for others.</i> [Abigail Van Buren, “Dear Abby,” <i>Deseret News,</i> 25 November 1976, p. 4C]</p>
<p>Said in another way by Wilfred A. Peterson:</p>
<p><i>The art of thanksgiving is </i>thanks living.<i> It is gratitude in action. It is applying Albert Schweitzer’s philosophy: “In gratitude for your own good fortune you must render in return some sacrifice of your life or other life.”</i></p>
<p><i>It is thanking God for each new day by living it to the fullest.</i>[“The Art of Thanksgiving,” <i>The Art of Living</i> (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961), pp. 44–45]</p>
<p>My prayer for each of us is that during this Thanksgiving season we can all count our blessings in a way that truthfully says, “Thanks be to God,” in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in ­general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question “What lack I yet?” and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, “Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer.”
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to “be more cheerful” or to “smile more often” or to “count their blessings.”
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happi­ness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing “an unconscious smile.”1 I have known people like that—­individuals who are continually smiling ­without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being “temple worthy,” what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day—and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet—and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to “thank the Lord thy God in all things” (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (Children’s Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song—“hear[ing] the song of a bird,” “look[ing] at the blue . . . sky,” having eyes to “see The color of butterfly wings,” and feeling “the wind as it rushes by.” Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, “What is a SWKT?” I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges—including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. [“Stories of the Century,” comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 1999–2000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lee’s memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the student’s tuition. . . .

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn “Count Your Blessings.” I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact—not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: “I can live for two months on a good compliment.”3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift—from friends, from family, from God—and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change people’s lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles—500 of it on foot. I’m not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I don’t believe I’ve ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lord’s hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries—our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease—we sometimes forget to confess the Lord’s hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimball’s statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Let’s take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
