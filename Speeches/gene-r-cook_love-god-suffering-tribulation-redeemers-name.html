  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="What a privilege it is to be here at Brigham Young University and to be able to address all of you wonderful students. Whether you know it or not, you convey a great spirit and are having and will have a great impact upon the world. As a result of the training you receive here and your personal righteousness, you truly are, as Jesus said, a &lt;i&gt;"light . . . on&lt;/i&gt; [a] &lt;i&gt;hill" &lt;/i&gt;(Matthew 5:14).

Sister Cook and I have been privileged to have all of our children attend BYU - six of whom have graduated and two others who are preparing to do so. At least they hope so. I hope we are all very appreciative of the First Presidency, who feel strongly about education and provide such a wonderful institution, even the Lords university.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loving God Even in the Face of Ones Trials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
This morning I would like to address a topic entitled "The Love of God: Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemers Name." Above all else, I desire that you know that God loves you. He loves all of His children across the world, and in spite of the very difficult problems being encountered worldwide these days, as well as in your individual lives, the love of God permeates all.

During a terrible war between the Lamanites and the Nephites where thousands were dying on both sides, Alma recorded:

&lt;i&gt;Many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 62:41]

Our trials can either end up hardening our heart or humbling us. How true the saying that suffering in life is inevitable, but misery is of our own making. In other words, because of the plan that we all agreed upon in the premortal life, we are going to suffer, whether we want to or not. However, if you can find how to suffer that tribulation in the Redeemers name, you will bear it well and perhaps even do it with an understanding, happy heart.

Lets look first at some catastrophic kinds of trials, and then later perhaps at some personal trials we all face.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catastrophic Suffering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Some weeks ago a devastating tsunami took the lives of more than 160,000 of the Lords children. How does one understand an event such as that and even see the Lords hand in developing additional love and trust in Him as a result of that event?

Many do not understand God and His purposes, as reflected in the following observations by current writers:

1. "In the aftermath of a cataclysm, with pictures of parents sobbing over dead infants . . . , faith-shaking questions arise: Where was God? Why does a good and all-powerful deity permit such evil and grief to fall on so many thousands of innocents? What did these people do to deserve such suffering?" (William Safire, "Where Was God?" &lt;i&gt;New York Times, &lt;/i&gt;10 January 2005, A23).

2. Another one: "How do people of faith make sense of the senseless? The answer is, we cant. The problem of suffering in this world has never been fully understood and cannot be completely explained" (Tom Schaefer from the &lt;i&gt;Wichita&lt;/i&gt; [Kansas] &lt;i&gt;Eagle,&lt;/i&gt; in "Why Did God Allow Tsunami Disaster?" &lt;i&gt;Deseret News,&lt;/i&gt; 1 January 2005, E2).

3. One last one: A reverend said, "The disaster has shaken my faith." A member of another Christian church said it had "made him hate God.. . . [He] now says that if God existed, this tragedy would have been prevented" (in Karen Mazurkewich and Geoffrey A. Fowler, "When Faith Is Tested," &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; 7 January 2005, W1, W10).

Certainly none of us as Latter-day Saints should be unduly surprised by prophesied last-day events such as these. The Lord said:

&lt;i&gt;And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring. &lt;/i&gt;[Luke 21:25]

&lt;i&gt;And the . . . waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 88:90]

I bear testimony that often, in the midst of suffering trials, afflictions, and discouragement, those very circumstances tutor us in developing increasing love and trust in God. Consequently, what a great blessing those trials are!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Individual Suffering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My purpose here today is not to focus so much on worldwide events but more so on individual suffering and trials, although the principles we discuss can apply to both.

If I could catalog suffering and trials among young people of your age, it probably would include some of the following entries:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"I have prayed fervently for something, but it has never occurred. Why wont God help me?"&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Why did my father have to die and leave my mother and us alone?"&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Why am I struggling with this chronic illness that makes me miserable most of the time?"&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Why am I not worth anything? It seems that others feel that way about me, and I do too. I feel worthless."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Brothers and sisters, is not that kind of suffering very real for many of us, and very intense as well? Here are some more:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"I have prayed and fasted for an eternal companion, but no one has come."&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Why did he break up with me? Things were going so well. My heart is broken."&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"We thought the purpose of marriage was to have children. We have prayed for years, and none have come."&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"I failed another algebra test. Why am I so dumb?"&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"I am so discouraged. Im not sure where my life is going. I feel surrounded in darkness, depressed, and have little or no hope."&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Where will the money come from for our apartment, our food, our books, our insurance, our car?"&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Why am I so heavy? They say Im bigboned, but the truth of it is, Im just downright fat."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Well, we could add a lot more suffering to that list, could we not? A struggling missionary asked me, "Elder Cook, when will this happiest two years of my life be over?"

A suffering friend once said, "I have been keeping the commandments and trying to do what is right. Why do they even call this plan the plan of happiness?"

Those are some very real questions. Unlike some in the world who do not understand the purposes of suffering, Latter-day Saints, thanks to the Restoration of the gospel, in large measure &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; understand. Why then do even the righteous suffer?
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Righteous Suffer but the Lord Delivers Them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.&lt;/i&gt; [Psalm 34:19]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;"After Much Tribulation Come the Blessings"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For after much tribulation come the blessings.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 58:34]

It is interesting to note that there would be even more suffering if it were not for the righteous in the land:

&lt;i&gt;If it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 10:2223]

Will you, right now, those of you here listening to me, humble your heart and prayerfully consider these additional words I am going to quote from the Lord? Do it with the Spirit, and I am confident that they &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; humble your heart, strengthen your faith, and increase your love for Him, in spite of some of your current trials. Here are some of the Lords answers as to &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; He allows such suffering.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Is to Prove Oneself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, . . . I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, . . . that you may be found worthy. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 98:14]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Creates a Witness Against Sin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
When the Saints were being cast into the fire in Almas day, he said:

&lt;i&gt;And he&lt;/i&gt; [the Lord] &lt;i&gt;doth suffer that they may do this thing . . . that . . . the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 14:11]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Teaches Obedience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 105:6]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Teaches Patience and Faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 23:21]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Assists One to Repent and Be Forgiven&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, &lt;b&gt;and I have loved you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 95:1; emphasis added]

Isnt it wonderful that the Lords motive in allowing suffering truly is love, and He will even prepare a way for our deliverance? Truly He has loved us during these serious trials, in spite of what some may think.

It is evident, brothers and sisters, that the Lord will use tragedy and sorrow to help humble His people and thereby cause them to repent and be saved. Listen carefully to this: &lt;i&gt;He loves you more than your being perfectly happy day by day, and thus He will do what is required to purify you so you can return to Him.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Can Occur from the Lord Hedging Up Your Way&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them. &lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 7:29]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering Brings Forth Righteousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them. &lt;/i&gt;[Hebrews 12:6, 11]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be Patient in Suffering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 24:8]

&lt;i&gt;The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord. &lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 24:15]
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lightening Your Burdens Through Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 31:38]

&lt;i&gt;And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 33:23]

Arent these profound answers clarifying why the righteous suffer? We, of all people, ought to stand and humbly bear testimony of how Gods great love can be found in the suffering of individuals, as well as of nations, and be able to explain to a large degree why much of that is occurring. Of course, no man knows all the purposes of God, and thus does not fully understand the full purpose of suffering. That is only known by the Lord.

On a personal note, I think in my own life of what a challenge my wife and I had when we were first married and went for nearly five years without having children, even though we fasted, prayed, and had numerous priesthood blessings concerning that challenge. We suffered much. However, in time, after adopting our first son, seven others came naturally, and we now stand as the parents of those eight children, plus 21 grandchildren.

Does the Lord fulfill His promises? He does. Be patient. Wait upon the Lord. He does love us.

Here is another personal example showing the uniqueness of the Lords gifts. All of my adult life I have suffered with very difficult health problems, some of which have been life-threatening. What lessons were taught in the process of all those years! I believe they could not have been learned any other way. They have helped me to be more Christlike. Truly the Lord knows the end from the beginning and will tutor, correct, mold, and even refine you in the furnace of affliction. He will do so until He has accomplished His purposes in purifying you, sanctifying you, and helping you draw closer to Him.

These kinds of gifts from the Lord are not always easy to understand, but I count them as priceless gifts to me and my family. One can sense the deep feelings of the Lord when He spoke these words:

&lt;i&gt;For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 88:33]

I pray that the Lord will help us to recognize even these unique gifts of suffering and to always be found giving thanks for them to the Giver of the gifts.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lord Sews a Spiritual Tapestry into All Our Lives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
How little does man understand the purposes of God! How true these words:

&lt;i&gt;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.&lt;/i&gt; [Isaiah 55:8]

&lt;i&gt;Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 76:2]

President Thomas S. Monson has spoken recently of "small hinges" upon which the very history of our lives turn ("Choose You This Day," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2004, 67). A few weeks ago my family and I discussed that thought, and we were deeply humbled to see how the Lord had directed all of our lives.

One married son said, "Had I not been the best man in my older brothers marriage, I would have missed meeting my future wife."

His wife responded, "If 15 years earlier my family had not determined to move to Ecuador, where they met your family, they would not have been invited to the reception and thus perhaps I never would have met my husband-to-be."

How does the Lord sew that kind of life tapestry to bring about such wonderful blessings?

Another son mentioned, "Dad, had you not &lt;i&gt;happened&lt;/i&gt; to be assigned to a particular stake conference, you would not have met my future wife and facilitated our meeting one another."

His wife said, "I just &lt;i&gt;happened&lt;/i&gt; to go to that conference, where my father presided that day, instead of my own stake."

And I must add, how was it that the president of the Quorum of the Twelve &lt;i&gt;happened&lt;/i&gt; to assign me to that particular conference that weekend?

My wife and I commented on the fact that had we not felt inspired to move from Arizona to Utah 35 years ago, much of what has just been said would not have happened. We concluded that in many ways our childrens "small hinges" were dependent upon our "small hinges" as their parents.

Of course, as Latter-day Saints we know that all those events are not predestined, but it is the Lords loving hand in our lives attempting to bless us with the very best that we can receive.

Add to all of this the times the Lord has used daily experiences to mold your personality, to refine your attributes, to help you be more Christlike. How complex it appears to man. How difficult it would be to influence all within one mans life in one day, let alone throughout his whole life. Think of the orchestration that is going on among your whole family, the whole community, and the whole world. Could any man ever comprehend the love and works of the Lord? I think not.

Brigham Young once said, "Every trial and experience you have passed through is necessary for your salvation" (&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 8:150). How blessed are we, my dear brothers and sisters, to recognize the Lord sewing this spiritual tapestry of our lives to produce a more Christlike individual. I remind you of these words:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works. &lt;/i&gt;[Jacob 4:10]

Could any man think to counsel the Lord on anything, even having a small view of what has just been described? All of this causes me to feel deeply the need to always pray more fervently for the will of the Lord in my life and, whatever I ask, to be sure to condition it upon His holy, divine, all-knowing will.

How great is the wisdom of God! How great is His love! I stand humbled - in absolute awe of my Heavenly Father, His love for us, and His glorious plan of happiness.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lord Will Help Us with Our Suffering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Prayerfully listen to these words:

&lt;i&gt;In all their afflictions he was afflicted. And the angel of his presence saved them; and in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bore them, and carried them all the days of old. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 133:53]

No trial or suffering will separate us from the love of God, said Paul the Apostle:

&lt;i&gt;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/i&gt; [Romans 8:35, 3839]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Men Can Bring Suffering upon Themselves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We have spoken of the suffering of the righteous - now a word regarding the suffering of the unrighteous. The Lord said:

&lt;i&gt;But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 19:17]

Also, one could surely increase his suffering by not keeping the commandments of the Lord, couldnt he? The Lord said:

&lt;i&gt;Remember to sin no more, lest perils shall come upon you.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 29:3]

&lt;i&gt;And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 12:3]

It ought to be easy to see in the case of those who sin that they bring much suffering and misery upon themselves by not keeping the commandments of the Lord. That is unfortunately true of some of us who know better but who are either not keeping the commandments or are just skirting the edges of some.

How many are suffering right now as a result of not keeping the Word of Wisdom - not only physically but spiritually being alienated from the Lord? How many other evil sins - such as robbery, abuse, or immorality - and thereby great suffering, result from someone not obeying the Word of Wisdom?

What great blessings are promised to those who obey the Sabbath day, even &lt;i&gt;"the fulness of the earth"&lt;/i&gt; (D&amp;amp;C 59:16; see also verses 15 through 21). What great losses, spiritually and temporally, come our way if we disobey?

What about the suffering that comes from those who do not pay an honest tithe and offering and therefore struggle with debt and financial hardship all the days of their lives?

What about the suffering that results from dishonesty or involvement in risky financial endeavors - even loss of trust, divorce, and imprisonment?

What great chastisement comes to one who disobeys the law of chastity and is involved in immodesty, petting, pornography, and fornication. He loses his faith, loses the Spirit, and even could lose his membership in the kingdom of God.

What suffering comes to one who skips his Church meetings and avoids having a Church calling? He not only loses the opportunity to give needed service but also retards the growth and development of his own soul.

Incorporated in all of the laws of the Lord are blessings that will be yours when you keep them and consequences causing you to suffer when you do not. When we disobey the Lord, we truly learn that &lt;i&gt;"wickedness never was happiness"&lt;/i&gt; (Alma 41:10).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Few Suggestions on Cheerfully Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemers Name (D&amp;amp;C 138:13)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
1. &lt;i&gt;Keep the commandments of the Lord with exactness.&lt;/i&gt; By so doing you will avoid the suffering of the wicked and reap the blessings the Lord has promised to the obedient.

2. &lt;i&gt;Endeavor to see more fully the Lords hand in your life and in the lives of those around you.&lt;/i&gt; The Lord loves you. Each day He adds to the beautiful spiritual tapestry being sewn of your life, if you allow Him to do so.

3. &lt;i&gt;When faced with adversity, trial, or suffering, do your best to increase your faith in the face of the trial.&lt;/i&gt; Many of less faith, when faced with a serious trial, become angry, weaken their faith, and thereby struggle and suffer more. Perhaps the real test of your faith is how to increase your faith and your love when trials come your way.

4. &lt;i&gt;Be patient. Wait on the Lord. Plead fervently for understanding and the ability to endure.&lt;/i&gt; Remember, we are not to counsel Him; He will counsel us. Be patient. Trust in Him for that which you do not know, and you will come to know much more. You will feel more profoundly of His personal love for you. Remember the words "even this will pass" and these sacred words: &lt;i&gt;"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord"&lt;/i&gt; (Job 1:21).

5. &lt;i&gt;Do not be discouraged along the way. &lt;/i&gt;My young friends, the devil delights in discouraging people and causing them to feel inadequate, unworthy, unneeded, and unloved. Discouragement is a tool of the devil. He uses much of our suffering and misery to bring about discouragement and thus fulfill his purpose. May I say with a smile: &lt;i&gt;Cheer up, pray, read in the scriptures, bear your testimony, sing, express love to God and to others, serve, obtain a priesthood blessing if need be, and do away with discouragement, the devils influence upon you.&lt;/i&gt;

6. &lt;i&gt;Humble yourself and repent of your personal sins&lt;/i&gt;. Humility before the Lord, a broken heart, and a contrite spirit truly seem to be the offering and sacrifice required of the Lord. The peace of the Spirit will then rest upon you and the love of God will fill your soul.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Testimony&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Well, brothers and sisters, let us return to where we began: "Where is God in all of the suffering that is going on in the world?" I testify of my certainty of His loving involvement. He uses trying circumstances for His purposes to develop true disciples of Christ, even a Zion people.

I express gratitude for the Lords hand upon me through the years. He has answered all of my prayers - even though at times I had no idea what His purpose was, nor perhaps still do. He has blessed me with many wonderful days - more of those than of difficult days of suffering and despair. And yet even in those difficult days I have felt the Lord reach out to me, felt the darkness disperse, and felt His personal love fill my very soul.

I bear witness that He is a God of love. He does love His children in spite of what many in the world may think. I bear testimony that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for all men.

May God bless us to be more humble, more repentant, more filled with faith, more trusting, and more loving to one another and to Him. This is His work. This is the true Church of Jesus Christ. The Church and the fullness of the gospel have been restored.

Living apostles and prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ walk the earth in our day. Of these things I humbly bear testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>What a privilege it is to be here at Brigham Young University and to be able to address all of you wonderful students. Whether you know it or not, you convey a great spirit and are having and will have a great impact upon the world. As a result of the training you receive here and your personal righteousness, you truly are, as Jesus said, a <i>"light . . . on</i> [a] <i>hill" </i>(Matthew 5:14).</p>
<p>Sister Cook and I have been privileged to have all of our children attend BYU - six of whom have graduated and two others who are preparing to do so. At least they hope so. I hope we are all very appreciative of the First Presidency, who feel strongly about education and provide such a wonderful institution, even the Lords university.</p>
<h2><b>Loving God Even in the Face of Ones Trials</b></h2>
<p>This morning I would like to address a topic entitled "The Love of God: Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemers Name." Above all else, I desire that you know that God loves you. He loves all of His children across the world, and in spite of the very difficult problems being encountered worldwide these days, as well as in your individual lives, the love of God permeates all.</p>
<p>During a terrible war between the Lamanites and the Nephites where thousands were dying on both sides, Alma recorded:</p>
<p><i>Many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.</i> [Alma 62:41]</p>
<p>Our trials can either end up hardening our heart or humbling us. How true the saying that suffering in life is inevitable, but misery is of our own making. In other words, because of the plan that we all agreed upon in the premortal life, we are going to suffer, whether we want to or not. However, if you can find how to suffer that tribulation in the Redeemers name, you will bear it well and perhaps even do it with an understanding, happy heart.</p>
<p>Lets look first at some catastrophic kinds of trials, and then later perhaps at some personal trials we all face.</p>
<h2><b>Catastrophic Suffering</b></h2>
<p>Some weeks ago a devastating tsunami took the lives of more than 160,000 of the Lords children. How does one understand an event such as that and even see the Lords hand in developing additional love and trust in Him as a result of that event?</p>
<p>Many do not understand God and His purposes, as reflected in the following observations by current writers:</p>
<p>1. "In the aftermath of a cataclysm, with pictures of parents sobbing over dead infants . . . , faith-shaking questions arise: Where was God? Why does a good and all-powerful deity permit such evil and grief to fall on so many thousands of innocents? What did these people do to deserve such suffering?" (William Safire, "Where Was God?" <i>New York Times, </i>10 January 2005, A23).</p>
<p>2. Another one: "How do people of faith make sense of the senseless? The answer is, we cant. The problem of suffering in this world has never been fully understood and cannot be completely explained" (Tom Schaefer from the <i>Wichita</i> [Kansas] <i>Eagle,</i> in "Why Did God Allow Tsunami Disaster?" <i>Deseret News,</i> 1 January 2005, E2).</p>
<p>3. One last one: A reverend said, "The disaster has shaken my faith." A member of another Christian church said it had "made him hate God.. . . [He] now says that if God existed, this tragedy would have been prevented" (in Karen Mazurkewich and Geoffrey A. Fowler, "When Faith Is Tested," <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> 7 January 2005, W1, W10).</p>
<p>Certainly none of us as Latter-day Saints should be unduly surprised by prophesied last-day events such as these. The Lord said:</p>
<p><i>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring. </i>[Luke 21:25]</p>
<p><i>And the . . . waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. </i>[D&amp;C 88:90]</p>
<p>I bear testimony that often, in the midst of suffering trials, afflictions, and discouragement, those very circumstances tutor us in developing increasing love and trust in God. Consequently, what a great blessing those trials are!</p>
<h2><b>Individual Suffering</b></h2>
<p>My purpose here today is not to focus so much on worldwide events but more so on individual suffering and trials, although the principles we discuss can apply to both.</p>
<p>If I could catalog suffering and trials among young people of your age, it probably would include some of the following entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I have prayed fervently for something, but it has never occurred. Why wont God help me?"</li>
<li>"Why did my father have to die and leave my mother and us alone?"</li>
<li>"Why am I struggling with this chronic illness that makes me miserable most of the time?"</li>
<li>"Why am I not worth anything? It seems that others feel that way about me, and I do too. I feel worthless."</li>
</ul>
<p>Brothers and sisters, is not that kind of suffering very real for many of us, and very intense as well? Here are some more:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I have prayed and fasted for an eternal companion, but no one has come."</li>
<li>"Why did he break up with me? Things were going so well. My heart is broken."</li>
<li>"We thought the purpose of marriage was to have children. We have prayed for years, and none have come."</li>
<li>"I failed another algebra test. Why am I so dumb?"</li>
<li>"I am so discouraged. Im not sure where my life is going. I feel surrounded in darkness, depressed, and have little or no hope."</li>
<li>"Where will the money come from for our apartment, our food, our books, our insurance, our car?"</li>
<li>"Why am I so heavy? They say Im bigboned, but the truth of it is, Im just downright fat."</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we could add a lot more suffering to that list, could we not? A struggling missionary asked me, "Elder Cook, when will this happiest two years of my life be over?"</p>
<p>A suffering friend once said, "I have been keeping the commandments and trying to do what is right. Why do they even call this plan the plan of happiness?"</p>
<p>Those are some very real questions. Unlike some in the world who do not understand the purposes of suffering, Latter-day Saints, thanks to the Restoration of the gospel, in large measure <i>do</i> understand. Why then do even the righteous suffer?</p>
<h3><em><b>The Righteous Suffer but the Lord Delivers Them</b></em></h3>
<p><i>Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</i> [Psalm 34:19]</p>
<h3><em><b>"After Much Tribulation Come the Blessings"</b></em></h3>
<p><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings.</i> [D&amp;C 58:34]</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that there would be even more suffering if it were not for the righteous in the land:</p>
<p><i>If it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared.</i> [Alma 10:2223]</p>
<p>Will you, right now, those of you here listening to me, humble your heart and prayerfully consider these additional words I am going to quote from the Lord? Do it with the Spirit, and I am confident that they <i>will</i> humble your heart, strengthen your faith, and increase your love for Him, in spite of some of your current trials. Here are some of the Lords answers as to <i>why</i> He allows such suffering.</p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Is to Prove Oneself</b></em></h3>
<p><i>Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, . . . I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, . . . that you may be found worthy. </i>[D&amp;C 98:14]</p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Creates a Witness Against Sin</b></em></h3>
<p>When the Saints were being cast into the fire in Almas day, he said:</p>
<p><i>And he</i> [the Lord] <i>doth suffer that they may do this thing . . . that . . . the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them.</i> [Alma 14:11]</p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Teaches Obedience</b></em></h3>
<p><i>And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer. </i>[D&amp;C 105:6]</p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Teaches Patience and Faith</b></em></h3>
<p><i>Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.</i> [Mosiah 23:21]</p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Assists One to Repent and Be Forgiven</b></em></h3>
<p><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, <b>and I have loved you.</b></i> [D&amp;C 95:1; emphasis added]</p>
<p>Isnt it wonderful that the Lords motive in allowing suffering truly is love, and He will even prepare a way for our deliverance? Truly He has loved us during these serious trials, in spite of what some may think.</p>
<p>It is evident, brothers and sisters, that the Lord will use tragedy and sorrow to help humble His people and thereby cause them to repent and be saved. Listen carefully to this: <i>He loves you more than your being perfectly happy day by day, and thus He will do what is required to purify you so you can return to Him.</i></p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Can Occur from the Lord Hedging Up Your Way</b></em></h3>
<p><i>I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them. </i>[Mosiah 7:29]</p>
<h3><em><b>Suffering Brings Forth Righteousness</b></em></h3>
<p><i>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them. </i>[Hebrews 12:6, 11]</p>
<h3><em><b>Be Patient in Suffering</b></em></h3>
<p><i>Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days.</i> [D&amp;C 24:8]</p>
<p><i>The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord. </i>[Mosiah 24:15]</p>
<h3><em><b>Lightening Your Burdens Through Christ</b></em></h3>
<p><i>That they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. </i>[Alma 31:38]</p>
<p><i>And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will.</i> [Alma 33:23]</p>
<p>Arent these profound answers clarifying why the righteous suffer? We, of all people, ought to stand and humbly bear testimony of how Gods great love can be found in the suffering of individuals, as well as of nations, and be able to explain to a large degree why much of that is occurring. Of course, no man knows all the purposes of God, and thus does not fully understand the full purpose of suffering. That is only known by the Lord.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I think in my own life of what a challenge my wife and I had when we were first married and went for nearly five years without having children, even though we fasted, prayed, and had numerous priesthood blessings concerning that challenge. We suffered much. However, in time, after adopting our first son, seven others came naturally, and we now stand as the parents of those eight children, plus 21 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Does the Lord fulfill His promises? He does. Be patient. Wait upon the Lord. He does love us.</p>
<p>Here is another personal example showing the uniqueness of the Lords gifts. All of my adult life I have suffered with very difficult health problems, some of which have been life-threatening. What lessons were taught in the process of all those years! I believe they could not have been learned any other way. They have helped me to be more Christlike. Truly the Lord knows the end from the beginning and will tutor, correct, mold, and even refine you in the furnace of affliction. He will do so until He has accomplished His purposes in purifying you, sanctifying you, and helping you draw closer to Him.</p>
<p>These kinds of gifts from the Lord are not always easy to understand, but I count them as priceless gifts to me and my family. One can sense the deep feelings of the Lord when He spoke these words:</p>
<p><i>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift. </i>[D&amp;C 88:33]</p>
<p>I pray that the Lord will help us to recognize even these unique gifts of suffering and to always be found giving thanks for them to the Giver of the gifts.</p>
<h2><b>The Lord Sews a Spiritual Tapestry into All Our Lives</b></h2>
<p>How little does man understand the purposes of God! How true these words:</p>
<p><i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i> [Isaiah 55:8]</p>
<p><i>Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out. </i>[D&amp;C 76:2]</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson has spoken recently of "small hinges" upon which the very history of our lives turn ("Choose You This Day," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 67). A few weeks ago my family and I discussed that thought, and we were deeply humbled to see how the Lord had directed all of our lives.</p>
<p>One married son said, "Had I not been the best man in my older brothers marriage, I would have missed meeting my future wife."</p>
<p>His wife responded, "If 15 years earlier my family had not determined to move to Ecuador, where they met your family, they would not have been invited to the reception and thus perhaps I never would have met my husband-to-be."</p>
<p>How does the Lord sew that kind of life tapestry to bring about such wonderful blessings?</p>
<p>Another son mentioned, "Dad, had you not <i>happened</i> to be assigned to a particular stake conference, you would not have met my future wife and facilitated our meeting one another."</p>
<p>His wife said, "I just <i>happened</i> to go to that conference, where my father presided that day, instead of my own stake."</p>
<p>And I must add, how was it that the president of the Quorum of the Twelve <i>happened</i> to assign me to that particular conference that weekend?</p>
<p>My wife and I commented on the fact that had we not felt inspired to move from Arizona to Utah 35 years ago, much of what has just been said would not have happened. We concluded that in many ways our childrens "small hinges" were dependent upon our "small hinges" as their parents.</p>
<p>Of course, as Latter-day Saints we know that all those events are not predestined, but it is the Lords loving hand in our lives attempting to bless us with the very best that we can receive.</p>
<p>Add to all of this the times the Lord has used daily experiences to mold your personality, to refine your attributes, to help you be more Christlike. How complex it appears to man. How difficult it would be to influence all within one mans life in one day, let alone throughout his whole life. Think of the orchestration that is going on among your whole family, the whole community, and the whole world. Could any man ever comprehend the love and works of the Lord? I think not.</p>
<p>Brigham Young once said, "Every trial and experience you have passed through is necessary for your salvation" (<i>JD</i> 8:150). How blessed are we, my dear brothers and sisters, to recognize the Lord sewing this spiritual tapestry of our lives to produce a more Christlike individual. I remind you of these words:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works. </i>[Jacob 4:10]</p>
<p>Could any man think to counsel the Lord on anything, even having a small view of what has just been described? All of this causes me to feel deeply the need to always pray more fervently for the will of the Lord in my life and, whatever I ask, to be sure to condition it upon His holy, divine, all-knowing will.</p>
<p>How great is the wisdom of God! How great is His love! I stand humbled - in absolute awe of my Heavenly Father, His love for us, and His glorious plan of happiness.</p>
<h2><b>The Lord Will Help Us with Our Suffering</b></h2>
<p>Prayerfully listen to these words:</p>
<p><i>In all their afflictions he was afflicted. And the angel of his presence saved them; and in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bore them, and carried them all the days of old. </i>[D&amp;C 133:53]</p>
<p>No trial or suffering will separate us from the love of God, said Paul the Apostle:</p>
<p><i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</i></p>
<p><i>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i> [Romans 8:35, 3839]</p>
<h2><b>Men Can Bring Suffering upon Themselves</b></h2>
<p>We have spoken of the suffering of the righteous - now a word regarding the suffering of the unrighteous. The Lord said:</p>
<p><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I.</i> [D&amp;C 19:17]</p>
<p>Also, one could surely increase his suffering by not keeping the commandments of the Lord, couldnt he? The Lord said:</p>
<p><i>Remember to sin no more, lest perils shall come upon you.</i> [D&amp;C 29:3]</p>
<p><i>And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him. </i>[Helaman 12:3]</p>
<p>It ought to be easy to see in the case of those who sin that they bring much suffering and misery upon themselves by not keeping the commandments of the Lord. That is unfortunately true of some of us who know better but who are either not keeping the commandments or are just skirting the edges of some.</p>
<p>How many are suffering right now as a result of not keeping the Word of Wisdom - not only physically but spiritually being alienated from the Lord? How many other evil sins - such as robbery, abuse, or immorality - and thereby great suffering, result from someone not obeying the Word of Wisdom?</p>
<p>What great blessings are promised to those who obey the Sabbath day, even <i>"the fulness of the earth"</i> (D&amp;C 59:16; see also verses 15 through 21). What great losses, spiritually and temporally, come our way if we disobey?</p>
<p>What about the suffering that comes from those who do not pay an honest tithe and offering and therefore struggle with debt and financial hardship all the days of their lives?</p>
<p>What about the suffering that results from dishonesty or involvement in risky financial endeavors - even loss of trust, divorce, and imprisonment?</p>
<p>What great chastisement comes to one who disobeys the law of chastity and is involved in immodesty, petting, pornography, and fornication. He loses his faith, loses the Spirit, and even could lose his membership in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>What suffering comes to one who skips his Church meetings and avoids having a Church calling? He not only loses the opportunity to give needed service but also retards the growth and development of his own soul.</p>
<p>Incorporated in all of the laws of the Lord are blessings that will be yours when you keep them and consequences causing you to suffer when you do not. When we disobey the Lord, we truly learn that <i>"wickedness never was happiness"</i> (Alma 41:10).</p>
<h2><b>A Few Suggestions on Cheerfully Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemers Name (D&amp;C 138:13)</b></h2>
<p>1. <i>Keep the commandments of the Lord with exactness.</i> By so doing you will avoid the suffering of the wicked and reap the blessings the Lord has promised to the obedient.</p>
<p>2. <i>Endeavor to see more fully the Lords hand in your life and in the lives of those around you.</i> The Lord loves you. Each day He adds to the beautiful spiritual tapestry being sewn of your life, if you allow Him to do so.</p>
<p>3. <i>When faced with adversity, trial, or suffering, do your best to increase your faith in the face of the trial.</i> Many of less faith, when faced with a serious trial, become angry, weaken their faith, and thereby struggle and suffer more. Perhaps the real test of your faith is how to increase your faith and your love when trials come your way.</p>
<p>4. <i>Be patient. Wait on the Lord. Plead fervently for understanding and the ability to endure.</i> Remember, we are not to counsel Him; He will counsel us. Be patient. Trust in Him for that which you do not know, and you will come to know much more. You will feel more profoundly of His personal love for you. Remember the words "even this will pass" and these sacred words: <i>"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord"</i> (Job 1:21).</p>
<p>5. <i>Do not be discouraged along the way. </i>My young friends, the devil delights in discouraging people and causing them to feel inadequate, unworthy, unneeded, and unloved. Discouragement is a tool of the devil. He uses much of our suffering and misery to bring about discouragement and thus fulfill his purpose. May I say with a smile: <i>Cheer up, pray, read in the scriptures, bear your testimony, sing, express love to God and to others, serve, obtain a priesthood blessing if need be, and do away with discouragement, the devils influence upon you.</i></p>
<p>6. <i>Humble yourself and repent of your personal sins</i>. Humility before the Lord, a broken heart, and a contrite spirit truly seem to be the offering and sacrifice required of the Lord. The peace of the Spirit will then rest upon you and the love of God will fill your soul.</p>
<h2><b>Final Testimony</b></h2>
<p>Well, brothers and sisters, let us return to where we began: "Where is God in all of the suffering that is going on in the world?" I testify of my certainty of His loving involvement. He uses trying circumstances for His purposes to develop true disciples of Christ, even a Zion people.</p>
<p>I express gratitude for the Lords hand upon me through the years. He has answered all of my prayers - even though at times I had no idea what His purpose was, nor perhaps still do. He has blessed me with many wonderful days - more of those than of difficult days of suffering and despair. And yet even in those difficult days I have felt the Lord reach out to me, felt the darkness disperse, and felt His personal love fill my very soul.</p>
<p>I bear witness that He is a God of love. He does love His children in spite of what many in the world may think. I bear testimony that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for all men.</p>
<p>May God bless us to be more humble, more repentant, more filled with faith, more trusting, and more loving to one another and to Him. This is His work. This is the true Church of Jesus Christ. The Church and the fullness of the gospel have been restored.</p>
<p>Living apostles and prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ walk the earth in our day. Of these things I humbly bear testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am humbled to stand where prophets, apostles, General Authorities, university presidents, important scholars, and world leaders have stood. As a student at BYU thirty years ago, I attended the devotionals and forums quite faithfully. I loved taking a break once a week to listen to remarkable individuals share their insights on a myriad of topics. I enjoyed listening and learning without any worry that I might be tested on what I was hearing. It was education at its best.
I am what I used to refer to as the dark horse in the devotional lineup. A dark horse is a completely unknown quantity with no name recognition whatsoever. You are probably like one of my students who looked at the list of speakers for the semester and asked, "Why are you on the list?"
My response to her was, "I dont know! Ive been asking myself the same question!" But whatever the reason, I am here, and I hope that something I share this morning will move you to open your hearts to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost and that you will be encouraged in your efforts to follow our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The Invitation
One of my favorite scriptures is found in Matthew 11. It is Christs universal invitation that speaks to each of us personally:
 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. [Matthew 11:2830]
I love this passage because in a few short verses Christ lays before us the path to eternal life. The overtones and undertones of these verses resonate with truth. First, the very fact that this is an invitation to "come," to "take," and to "learn" indicates an acknowledgment of and a respect for our agency. This respect for agency causes me to think of our premortal life, when we fought in our Fathers army to preserve and maintain the condition of agency in this life. It seems right that Christ, who is the linchpin in our Fathers plan of happiness, would acknowledge that it is our choice to come unto Him or not.
I also appreciate the simple promise of rest that is given. Having labored under sin and its heavy weight of guilt and separation from God, I am grateful for the rest and reconciliation Christ promises to those who come unto Him.
I find great meaning in the word yoke. It evokes so many important things about Christs path. A yoke is a wooden bar or frame by which two draft animals are joined at the neck for the purpose of working together to pull a heavy load. A yoke is also a frame fitted to a persons shoulders to carry a load in two equal portions. Whether we envision a double or a single yoke, the Savior is part of this image. We are either teamed with Him, side by side, or we are carrying His yoke. Yokes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Welcome to fall semester. We hope you have all been able to settle into your new schedules. Fall semester can be a time of fresh starts. It can be a time of great expectations. It can also be a time when things are practically perfect. For example, it is probably safe to say that right now most of you have perfect grades in all of your classes! It can be a time when hopes run high and your roommate situation is quite fabulous. It is a time when all of our athletic teams are on course for tremendous seasons - yes, even perhaps national championships! And it is a time when you are able to meet new people, even perhaps that special someone.
The beginning of fall semester can indeed be an exciting time. You are most likely focused on a course of study and ready for what this new semester has to offer. We are excited for you! We hope that all of your expectations are met and that your experience here is a wonderfully memorable one. We also hope that as you are here at Brigham Young University and after you leave to pursue your own course in life, you will always take great care to do those things that will keep you out of harms way, both temporally and spiritually; that you will have proper focus and perspective; and that you will heed the counsel of Nephis brother Jacob, who said to his family, "O be wise; what can I say more?" (Jacob 6:12).
Sometimes as we embark and proceed on a new journey we find that our expectations are not met. What we had anticipated and hoped for in the beginning of our journey has not come to pass. Our ideals are not our realities. Maybe we are not getting the grades we had hoped for or we havent met that special someone. Perhaps we didnt get the job we thought we deserved. We may find that things are just not working out as we had planned. The question then becomes, What will be our reaction to our unanticipated situation? What will we do? This is where I believe Jacobs counsel to "be wise" deserves serious attention.
At times, in these situations, the easiest thing to do is to place the responsibility for our situation on something or someone else. This is a dangerous course to take. It is harmful. It is extremely unwise. We see this in the Book of Mormon when people blamed their behavior on the traditions of their fathers. Not accepting responsibility for the direction of our own lives can distort our perceptions and can cause us to lose focus of the things that are important. It can cause us to become disoriented and can keep us from progressing. It is a waste of valuable time in these days of our earthly probation.
Another easy but unwise thing we might do during unforeseen situations is obsess about things we cant control. Recently I read about "a thrill-seeking photographer" who was described as a person who "often diced with death in the water."1 He would repeatedly put himself into very dangerous situations in order to capture footage of </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am humbled and thankful to be among so many friends today and to see so many of my current and former students. Thank you for this opportunity, President Worthen.
I grew up on a large cattle ranch, first near Eureka, Nevada, and later in Kanosh, Utah. I would start the days very early by catching and saddling my horse in the moonlit and frosty morning hours. As the first rays of sunshine would start coming over the mountains, the cowboys I was working with would scatter out and begin looking for cows and calves from among sagebrush flats and juniper-covered hillsides. The sight was surreal as I would watch hundreds of cows and calves being herded toward a corral to be branded and vaccinated.
As a young boy I aspired to be able to rope the calves as my part of the branding. Alternative responsibilities entailed wrestling the calves to the ground, oftentimes resulting in me getting kicked or run over. At about the age of seven, after repeated failures in tackling the calves, I was finally allowed to try my hand at roping. I remember proudly getting my lasso rope ready and searching out the smallest and slowest-looking calf in the herd. I carefully planned my throw, and I felt the thrill of accomplishment when the loop settled over the calf successfully. Though the calf was seemingly small and slow, I felt its tremendous force start to jerk me off my horse. Despite trying my best to hold onto the calf, I found that my strength was no match for him. Just as I was being violently jerked out of my saddle, I heard a wise cowboy yell across to me: "Dally up!"
To dally means to take the rope and making two or three quick wraps around the saddle horn. The saddle becomes an anchor point, which connects to the greater strength of a steady and powerful horse. The dally transformed my situation of having inadequate personal strength to being able to access a greater power that anchored the turbulent polar forces acting upon me. This simple act allowed me to draw strength from something far greater than myself. Instead of being violently yanked from my saddle, I found the relative ease of letting my horse do the pulling while I had the much more simple and manageable task of holding the dally tight and maintaining the connection to the anchoring force.
Many times in my life since then I have felt the strength of greater powers than I have been prepared to withstand. These have seemed to yank me from a place of security and comfort. Each time, I have reflected upon opportunities to dally up to a power greater than my own that can serve as an anchor of strength. I would like to share some of the points of my learning about how to dally up in our inevitable circumstances and the need to find our anchor during turbulent times in our lives:
1. Strength in service
2. Strength in involvement

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an adjunct professor who has taught at BYU for several years, I am in awe of this amazing institution that attracts the finest, most extraordinary faculty and stu-dents on the planet.
I honor you and believe that King Benjamin could have easily been describing you when he said:
And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual. [Mosiah 2:41]
Yes, you are awesome, and this could be the most important assignment I have ever had as a professional speaker. Consequently, I wanted to be at my best.
However, as I was getting ready this morning, I noticed that I was losing hair on my head and growing it in my nose and ears and on my back - in places I dont even need it. That is not a fair trade-off. My only hope this morning was that the hair in my right ear would grow long enough so that I could comb it up over the top of my head and fake all of you out! It didnt happen.
When President Worthen asked me to speak to you today, two life-altering experiences surfaced in my mind, helping me focus my remarks. First, I recently returned from an eighteen-day military tribute tour with my invited guests American Idol finalist/Sony recording artist David Archuleta; world-class musician, vocal coach, and musical director Dean Kaelin; and celebrity impressionist Jason Hewlett. We performed our Evening of Music, Comedy, and Motivational Theater to fourteen amazing audiences; held six firesides for the U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Kuwait along the Iraqi border; and concluded the tour with a special visit to the missionaries, members, and investigators in Ethiopia. We were touched by the dedication of Church members and the fearless commitment to service before self of our brave men and women in uniform. And when we got shot at and returned machine gun fire during one of our flights in a Chinook helicopter to a remote forward operating base, I realized that we should never take our freedom for granted and was reminded of the sense of urgency with which we all should live our lives.
The second life-altering experience happened on October 23, 2010, when I had the rare opportunity to soar to the edge of space in a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Because it was a classified mission, I can only tell you that at 70,000 feet you can see two-thirds of the state of California. At 80,000 feet you can see some distinctly mapped outlines of America. And at 90,000 feet you tear up and feel like you can reach out and touch the face of God! It was a spiritual experience I wish each of you could have.
For four hours I sat in the sounds of silence, looking at the breathtaking curvature of the earth, gazing into the endless blackness of space, pondering eternity, and reflecting on President Dieter F. Uchtdorfs reminder that we are more </span>
