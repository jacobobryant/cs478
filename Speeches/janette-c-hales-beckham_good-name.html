  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you, President Snow, for that introduction. It is a thrill for me to think of you in so many settings. I have tremendous respect for you, the work you are doing, and the decisions you are making at this time in life. If I have ever visited with any of you in the past, perhaps you noticed that my name has changed. I was married in April to a wonderful man who had also lost his spouse. I am appreciative that not only did President Snow use the correct name, but he also pronounced it correctly.

Has anyone ever mispronounced your name? I would guess that even though we each try to overlook such an error when it occurs, it always feels a little disappointing that the person doesnt really know you or perhaps has not given you much careful consideration.

After being Janette Hales for forty years, it has been no small project to change my name on written documents. One business sent my statement as Janette Hales Beck. When I called to make a correction, the secretary replied lightly, "Oh, Janette Hales Beckham is too long for the line on the computer."

My experiences have kept me thinking about names. In the state of Utah it is not unusual to have towns named after people in the Book of Mormon. I heard of a tourist couple who were driving through Utah and commenting on the unusual names of the towns. As they saw Nephi on the map, the wife said, "Do you suppose that is Nep-hi?" Her husband responded, "Perhaps Nephy." They decided to stop for lunch, and when the waitress brought their check, she asked if she could do anything else to help them. The gentleman said, "Tell us how to pronounce the name of this place." The waitress responded, "Burger King."

Just as a little child starts to develop a sense of identity as he or she repeatedly hears a name, I believe our names are important to our identity always. As a young mother I returned to take a class from the university I attended and found naturally that things were very much changed. I didnt know anyone. One day one of my past professors came into the room, noticed me, and said, "Janette Callister, how nice to see you." She turned to my current professor and said she remembered me as a good student. I still remember the good feeling I had that somebody really knew me and remembered me for good. Many of you perhaps share with me that great feeling of being recognized in a positive way when you are in a strange place.

One of my dear friends said her son tried out as a walk-on for the BYU football team. One day during the tedious drills, Coach LaVell Edwards said, "How ya doing, Hogan?" Her son came home with new enthusiasm and reported, "Coach Edwards knew my name." As a national leader in the football profession, Coach Edwards has become known as one who knows his players, both present and past, and calls them by name. This is no small accomplishment when you have names such as Elias Fahapula, Itula Mili, and Vaha Ongo-ongotau.

As a young wife I often gave my name as Mrs. Robert Hales at places like the cleaners or when doing business over the telephone. I realize I did that because it was easier to spell. When I said "Janette Hales," almost always someone would ask, "How do you spell it?" When I said "Mrs. Robert Hales," at least the Robert or Bob part was a little easier.

One day when one of my daughters was going through registration in college, she called to ask if I would come down and sign for her so she and her roommates wouldnt have to pay a deposit for the telephone. Evidently someone with a home and an account with the phone company could guarantee a new account. After standing in a very long line (which Im sure most of you could relate to), I got to the clerk with the necessary paperwork filled out. To my surprise she said, "You dont have an account with us." I FELT NONEXISTENT! I knew I had been paying bills to the telephone company for twenty years, but my name was not Robert Hales. From that time on I made sure I had a name. I made sure my name was recorded on accounts, that it was spelled correctly, and I used my name.

Names are always important, and names have meaning. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, naming is a priesthood ordinance, and it comes with a blessing. It is significant that we are known by the name our parents choose for us on the records of the Church and throughout our mortal lives. This given name has importance in all the priesthood ordinances, including the endowment and the sealing temple ordinances.

We use other names that are meaningful as we mature and take responsibility. New names bring blessings, and not just for babies.

Missionaries become "elder" and "sister" and all but forget their first names. This is a symbolic but very real manifestation of their putting aside their own pursuits to be joined to the purposes of the Lord. Other names bring blessings and responsibilities: Mother, Father, Bishop, President.

Before record keeping began, most people had only one name, such as John. As the population increased, it became necessary to distinguish between individuals with the same name. Descriptive information had to be added, such as John Christiansen (son of Christian), John Geldzahler (gold counter), or John Rotkoph (redhead).

This practice still happens today. Elder Packer told of one young boy who, until he was four years old, thought his name was Johnny . . . Stop. Sometimes we use as names or as nouns words that would be less limiting as adjectives. Have you ever heard parents say, "Oh, hes our athlete" or "Shes our scholar" - as if we only have to be one thing. Our naming or descriptions may unintentionally limit a persons self-image: "Oh, shes our little tomboy" or "I guess he is our black sheep" (as if we each had to have one). A label is attached when a person may only be showing a temporary interest or a momentary struggle. Beware of names that are negative or limiting.

You might ask your parents how your name was selected. Listen to what Helaman tells his sons Nephi and Lehi about their names:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 5:67]

Nephi and Lehi carried in their names the identity of the good works of their ancestors. Just as your name gives identity to you, your behavior can give identity to your own name. When you are born, the identity is given to you as your parents give you your name. An infants identity is attached to the parents or caregivers. Children gradually enlarge their identity to family and even belongings, then later to friends, school, labels, styles. Yet we are reminded in Proverbs "Even a child is known by his doings" (20:11). Lets consider the identity we get through attachments. I remember many years ago attending a high school basketball tournament after my own children had all graduated. I had somehow forgotten the noise and enthusiasm of such an event. As we found our places in the upper balconies surrounded by students with the right colors, I quickly evaluated the appropriate behavior for the occasion. In my detached state, the scene momentarily became rather humorous to me. A student observing my momentary stupor seemed to increase his volume as he chanted, his eyes bulging and the veins prominently standing out on his neck: "Were Number One! Were Number One! Were Number One!" Something devious in me wanted so badly to whisper, "Number one what?" All we had done was buy a three-dollar ticket.

Were Number One - I call that identity by attachment. My team is outstanding, therefore I am outstanding. A bit temporary but a good feeling nonetheless. We might consider some of those attachments that give us temporary identity. It is easy to get stuck there. The right club, the right car, the right clothes may seem who we are - identity by attachment. There is danger in this. The Savior warned, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 14:21). But he warned the hypocrite, "And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you" (verse 23). Strengthening our identity with our Heavenly Father takes a different kind of commitment. It has much more to do with our behavior than our belongings. Usually as a person matures spiritually, more of identity comes from developing ones own talents and increasing ones ability to serve others. As you mature, your life and characteristics will give identity to your name. Your work and behavior will better define who you are.

Perhaps many of you have read the story of President George Albert Smith that he referred to as "Your Good Name." He described an experience he had in his later years.

&lt;i&gt;I became so weak as to be scarcely able to move. It was a slow and exhausting effort for me even to turn over in bed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;One day, under these conditions, I lost consciousness of my surroundings and thought I had passed to the Other Side.&lt;/i&gt;

George Albert Smith described what he saw and then wrote:

&lt;i&gt;I saw a man coming towards me. I became aware that he was a very large man, and I hurried my steps to reach him, because I recognized him as my grandfather. . . . I remember how happy I was to see him coming. I had been given his name and had always been proud of it.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When Grandfather came within a few feet of me, he stopped. His stopping was an invitation for me to stop. Then - and this I would like the . . . young people never to forget - he looked at me very earnestly and said:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"I would like to know what you have done with my name."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Everything I had ever done passed before me as though it were a flying picture on a screen - everything I had done. Quickly this vivid retrospect came down to the very time I was standing there. My whole life had passed before me. I smiled and looked at my grandfather and said:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"I have never done anything with your name of which you need be ashamed."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He stepped forward and took me in his arms, and as he did so, I became conscious again of my earthly surroundings. My pillow was as wet as though water had been poured on it - wet with tears of gratitude that I could answer unashamed.&lt;/i&gt;

President Smith continued:

&lt;i&gt;I have thought of this many times, and I want to tell you that I have been trying, more than ever since that time, to take care of that name. So I want to say to &lt;/i&gt;. . .&lt;i&gt;the young men and women, to the youth of the Church and of all the world: Honor your fathers and your mothers. Honor the names that you bear, because some day you will have the privilege and the obligation of reporting to them (and to your Father in heaven) what you have done with their name. &lt;/i&gt;[George Albert Smith, &lt;i&gt;Sharing the Gospel with Others &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1948), p. 11112]

What a wonderful heritage George Albert Smith had received from his grandfather, and he was able to continue that righteous tradition. Perhaps some would relate more, however, to the experience of a young woman who shared her story in the &lt;i&gt;New Era. &lt;/i&gt;This young woman, a convert, came from such a wildly dysfunctional family that she decided she had bad blood. She felt second class to lifelong Church members she considered "born in the covenant." Through a priesthood blessing the young woman was told that the story of Ruth had a special message for her. She read the story but at first didnt understand the significance. She writes what happened:

&lt;i&gt;Finally, through the Spirit, it came to me. The key was at the very end of the book, where it mentions Ruths part in the lineage of . . . Christ. Ruth, . . . the convert from a foreign land, showed such great faith that she became an integral part of the most blessed bloodline of all. This great woman, who came from generations of idol worshipers, would be a forebear of the Savior of the world. &lt;/i&gt;[Kay Hago, "From One of the Best Families," &lt;i&gt;New Era, &lt;/i&gt;June 1991, p.20]

The young woman added that just one scripture story helped her find her place in life and the kingdom by teaching that no blessing would be withheld from her because she wasnt born to LDS parents. She found out she came from the best of families, our Heavenly Fathers family. As this woman strengthened her identity with our Heavenly Father, she felt differently about her potential and her purpose in life.

We have accounts in biblical history when the change of a persons name becomes a symbol of a major change in a persons life. When the Lord appeared to Abram when he was ninety-nine, he said:

&lt;i&gt;Walk before me, and be thou perfect. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. &lt;/i&gt;[Genesis 17:15]

Jacobs name was changed to Israel at the time he saw God (see Genesis 32:28). The apostle Paul was known as Saul in his early life, but he was called Paul after the beginning of his ministry (see Acts 13:9).

A friend pointed out that Pauls references as he introduced himself changed as his ministry progressed. In Corinthians he referred to himself as an apostle and later as a servant (see Romans, Philippians, and Titus), a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and a fellow laborer (see Philemon).

It is interesting that as Pauls ministry progressed, his self-identity seemed to become less important or at least secondary to his work in representing the name of Jesus Christ and His teachings in establishing the Church. He had strengthened his identity with our Heavenly Father, and Gods purpose became his purpose.

As I considered changing my name, I thought perhaps I could learn to be a better person. After deciding to remarry, there were many decisions to be made, such as where we would live. It seems a bit immature now that I think about it, but none of the decisions seemed more important to me than what I would be called. I had been Janette C. Hales for forty years, and it bothered me when one of my children said, "I guess we wont be the Hales family any more." Of course we will, but they had to think through their mother having a different name. When the marriage announcements went out, someone from the Church magazines called the Young Women office and asked what I would be called after my marriage. My secretary instructed very clearly that I would be Janette Hales Beckham. The person on the other end of the line asked, "But will she be Sister Hales or Sister Beckham?"

A friend of mine suggested I might try her husbands advice to her: "If you give a poor talk, use your maiden name."

I remember well the day my first granddaughter was blessed and named Emily Janette. Her parents had chosen to give her my name. My heart reached out as her father, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, took her in his arms and gave her a name and a blessing. I found myself wanting all the best for this little granddaughter. As I expressed my love and bore my testimony that day, I thought how my feelings must be in small measure how our Heavenly Father must feel as we take upon us the name of His Son, Jesus Christ. I am reminded that He wants all the best for us. With His name we have the opportunity to become changed and take upon ourselves His attributes.

For little Emily, now four years old, as well as for each one of us, this requires learning and experience as well as a great deal of commitment. Although we are each innocent at birth, we are basically self-centered, lacking in experience, and quite intent on survival.

At baptism Emily will take upon herself the name of Jesus Christ as most of us have done. That responsibility and blessing becomes our new identity. Attend baptisms. Listen to the words. I believe we have to make a conscious effort to strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.

Attend confirmations. Listen to the blessings when the Holy Ghost is given. We must each remind ourselves of our eternal identity.

Recently a young woman wrote to me with concerns about her progress. She wrote:

&lt;i&gt;I have been wondering about making it back to our Heavenly Father. Worried is more like it. My mom once told me that to worry is to lack faith in God, so using that word kind of makes me cringe. But, to me I feel if I dont make it even when I try my hardest, it will be the biggest disappointment. I guess you could say that I have &lt;/i&gt;little &lt;i&gt;faith. &lt;/i&gt;Little &lt;i&gt;everything is more like it. You asked us what is the biggest problem facing the &lt;/i&gt;[young people] &lt;i&gt;in the Church today. Among the answers some gave were drugs, alcohol, things like that. While those, along with teenage pregnancies, are rich among the community, I dont think that those are the main problems. Yes in the world, but not in the Church. To me, I see struggling to know who we are. Struggling to know the truth, wanting to be loved and cherished for what we do, needing lots of hugs and "I love yous," needing to feel needed.&lt;/i&gt;

This is a wonderful letter - so normal, so honest, so sincere. Sometimes we feel our faith is "little" when it is really just young and inexperienced. Sometimes when we add a long list of emotional needs to our need to know who we are, we confuse the issue. Focusing on finding ways to strengthen your personal identity will very likely help get some of the other needs met in the proper time. You do strengthen your identity with our Heavenly Father when you practice doing the things He has asked you to do.

How can you strengthen your own personal identity? I can tell you how in three simple words. Do good things! If that sounds too simplistic, lets try three other words. Keep the commandments! I could continue. Do more good! Love one another! Serve one another! I could continue. Keep a journal! President Spencer W. Kimball said through keeping a journal we come to know ourselves (see &lt;i&gt;TSWK, &lt;/i&gt;p. 351; also see "President Kimball Speaks Out on Personal Journals,"&lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;December 1980, p. 61). Three words that can mean so much: Be more Christlike!

The search for identity and purpose is fundamental to everyone. The scriptures are filled with events in the lives of those searching for answers to these fundamental questions. We read of the struggles of those who found false identity.

In Alma 1 we read of a man, "and his name was Nehor" (verse 15), "and he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel" (verse 6). And the people who found their identity in his false teachings "began to be proud" (verse 22). As those contentious people caused affliction to the Church, we read in Alma 1:24: "The hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God."

Alma himself recounts to his son Helaman his own search for identity: "For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way" (Alma 36:6).

Alma had such remorse for the awful things he had done, he longed to be nonexistent. In his words, "Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body" (Alma 36:15). Then, as he continues to relate the torment he suffered remembering his sins, he said, "I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world" (verse 17). Alma was again in touch with his divine identity through a loving Savior. Speaking again to Helaman:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 36:2123]

In the Church we learn about our identity very young in our families. In family home evening and in Primary we sing "I am a child of God." Children strengthen their identity as they learn to be nice, dont hit, help mommy; but it becomes more complex: say youre sorry, tell the truth, do your homework, forgive your brother, say your prayers.

As we grow and live and learn, as we love and serve one another, we understand how our choices, our behavior, help us become who we are. Alma warned his son Corianton that "wickedness never was happiness" (see Alma 41:10). He teaches him that the kind of person or the identity he develops in this life is the identity he will have in the Resurrection.

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 41:1415]

Alma understood the change and the behavior that helps us develop our divine and eternal identity. Bruce R. McConkie spoke of the doctrine of the new birth:

&lt;i&gt;There is a natural birth, and there is a spiritual birth. . . . The natural birth creates a natural man, and the natural man is an enemy to God. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The spiritual birth comes after the natural birth. . . . It is to begin a new life, . . . a spiritual life. &lt;/i&gt;[Bruce R. McConkie, &lt;i&gt;A New Witness for the Articles of Faith&lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 282]

For Alma, the change took place in a dramatic way. For many, it is a gradual change. Those changes in behavior can best be observed as we see good people become refined spiritually as they serve and sacrifice and honor eternal covenants.

Just prior to my first husbands death, he spoke in a ward conference. He told of a couple who had been coming to him as patients for twenty-five years. In the early years one would drop the other at the office and then run errands while the eye examination took place.

As years passed, each spouse would wait while the other was being examined. As more years passed, he noticed the wife was the driver, and she would assist her husband as he came into the office. Then they started coming to the examining room together. In time the wife started coming to the office alone. My husband inquired about her husbands health. She explained that she wasnt able to lift or care for him alone anymore and he was living in a rest home. She said, "I go every day, but I dont believe he even knows me. This morning I said, Clarence, do you know who I am?" He studied her face carefully and then said, "No, but I know youre someone who loves me." Perhaps that is all that really matters. Are you recognized as one who loves others?

Life is about learning how to be more like our Savior, to strengthen our identity with Him. We learn to sacrifice our wants for the needs of others. We learn to love as He loved.

Our prophets have said there is only one name under heaven whereby man can be saved. It is the name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 18:23).

Does changing my name make me a different person? I want to be a better person. Marriage gives me new opportunity to love, share, and serve; but changing my name was also a reminder of the importance of a name and the blessing of His name, the name of Jesus Christ. Each one of us through the Atonement can leave behind that identity that would hold us back or tear us down. We can repent, forgive, forget. We can strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father as we change and as we serve. There are many characteristics in the scriptures that distinguish a righteous people - those who take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.

Do any of you experience feelings of trauma or self-doubt when you are going through times of change - a new school year, a new job, a mission? There is great opportunity that comes with change. That is the way the gospel works in our lives. We have the opportunity to change, to become better, to strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father. Perhaps this year will be a significant time for you to strengthen your identity in good ways.

As we each consider our own names,

I believe the scriptures will be a helpful guide: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches" (Proverbs 22:1).

The Savior warned of those who would have a false identity.

&lt;i&gt;Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ye shall know them by their fruits. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. &lt;/i&gt;[Matthew 7:1516, 18, 20]

As we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father, it is important that we revere the name of God and His Son, Jesus Christ.

&lt;i&gt;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. &lt;/i&gt;[Exodus 20:7]

As we follow the teachings of our Heavenly Father, it is important that we respect and revere the names of one another. I read a study by the National School Safety Center. The centers executive director, Ronald G. Stephens, stated that "fourth-through-12th graders around the nation . . . mentioned name-calling, cursing or staring . . . as the most common triggers for violence" (quoted in Ellen Graham, "Language of Childhood: No Expletives Deleted," &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal, &lt;/i&gt;17 July 1995, p. B-1).

The old saying "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me" is probably not true. We should use respectful names and respect the proper names of others. Our Heavenly Father would expect that of us. As the Lord has told us, He will not hold those guiltless who take His name in vain. The Lord has also told us that he will not forsake those that know his name and trust in him (see Psalms 9:910).

Surely our Heavenly Father could recognize us as His children if our behavior resembled those who believe on His name.

In Moroni we read:

&lt;i&gt;And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith. &lt;/i&gt;[Moroni 6:34]

The changing of a name is symbolic. The change in us must be real. As we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father, surely it will be evident in our behavior.

President Hinckley has spoken to us regarding our divine identity. He has said:

&lt;i&gt;You are &lt;/i&gt;[sons and daughters] &lt;i&gt;of God, each of you, endowed with something of his divinity. It is a part of your eternal nature. You cannot afford to live beneath that portion of divinity. &lt;/i&gt;. . .

&lt;i&gt;You will not need to be reminded to be virtuous, you will not need to be reminded to be clean, if you will remember always that you are &lt;/i&gt;[sons and daughters] &lt;i&gt;of God, that a portion of his divinity is within you, and that you must make an accounting to him. &lt;/i&gt;[Gordon B. Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;The Wonderful Thing That Is You and the Wonderful Good You Can Do &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1988), pp. 3, 8]

May we remember as we partake of the sacrament each Sunday the great blessing it is to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Listen to the words that we covenant with our Eternal Father:

&lt;i&gt;That &lt;/i&gt;[we] &lt;i&gt;are willing to take upon &lt;/i&gt;[us] &lt;i&gt;the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given &lt;/i&gt;[us], &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;[we] &lt;i&gt;may always have his Spirit to be with &lt;/i&gt;[us]. [Moroni 4:3]

May we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father and remember that we have taken upon ourselves the name of His Son is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Thank you, President Snow, for that introduction. It is a thrill for me to think of you in so many settings. I have tremendous respect for you, the work you are doing, and the decisions you are making at this time in life. If I have ever visited with any of you in the past, perhaps you noticed that my name has changed. I was married in April to a wonderful man who had also lost his spouse. I am appreciative that not only did President Snow use the correct name, but he also pronounced it correctly.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever mispronounced your name? I would guess that even though we each try to overlook such an error when it occurs, it always feels a little disappointing that the person doesnt really know you or perhaps has not given you much careful consideration.</p>
<p>After being Janette Hales for forty years, it has been no small project to change my name on written documents. One business sent my statement as Janette Hales Beck. When I called to make a correction, the secretary replied lightly, "Oh, Janette Hales Beckham is too long for the line on the computer."</p>
<p>My experiences have kept me thinking about names. In the state of Utah it is not unusual to have towns named after people in the Book of Mormon. I heard of a tourist couple who were driving through Utah and commenting on the unusual names of the towns. As they saw Nephi on the map, the wife said, "Do you suppose that is Nep-hi?" Her husband responded, "Perhaps Nephy." They decided to stop for lunch, and when the waitress brought their check, she asked if she could do anything else to help them. The gentleman said, "Tell us how to pronounce the name of this place." The waitress responded, "Burger King."</p>
<p>Just as a little child starts to develop a sense of identity as he or she repeatedly hears a name, I believe our names are important to our identity always. As a young mother I returned to take a class from the university I attended and found naturally that things were very much changed. I didnt know anyone. One day one of my past professors came into the room, noticed me, and said, "Janette Callister, how nice to see you." She turned to my current professor and said she remembered me as a good student. I still remember the good feeling I had that somebody really knew me and remembered me for good. Many of you perhaps share with me that great feeling of being recognized in a positive way when you are in a strange place.</p>
<p>One of my dear friends said her son tried out as a walk-on for the BYU football team. One day during the tedious drills, Coach LaVell Edwards said, "How ya doing, Hogan?" Her son came home with new enthusiasm and reported, "Coach Edwards knew my name." As a national leader in the football profession, Coach Edwards has become known as one who knows his players, both present and past, and calls them by name. This is no small accomplishment when you have names such as Elias Fahapula, Itula Mili, and Vaha Ongo-ongotau.</p>
<p>As a young wife I often gave my name as Mrs. Robert Hales at places like the cleaners or when doing business over the telephone. I realize I did that because it was easier to spell. When I said "Janette Hales," almost always someone would ask, "How do you spell it?" When I said "Mrs. Robert Hales," at least the Robert or Bob part was a little easier.</p>
<p>One day when one of my daughters was going through registration in college, she called to ask if I would come down and sign for her so she and her roommates wouldnt have to pay a deposit for the telephone. Evidently someone with a home and an account with the phone company could guarantee a new account. After standing in a very long line (which Im sure most of you could relate to), I got to the clerk with the necessary paperwork filled out. To my surprise she said, "You dont have an account with us." I FELT NONEXISTENT! I knew I had been paying bills to the telephone company for twenty years, but my name was not Robert Hales. From that time on I made sure I had a name. I made sure my name was recorded on accounts, that it was spelled correctly, and I used my name.</p>
<p>Names are always important, and names have meaning. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, naming is a priesthood ordinance, and it comes with a blessing. It is significant that we are known by the name our parents choose for us on the records of the Church and throughout our mortal lives. This given name has importance in all the priesthood ordinances, including the endowment and the sealing temple ordinances.</p>
<p>We use other names that are meaningful as we mature and take responsibility. New names bring blessings, and not just for babies.</p>
<p>Missionaries become "elder" and "sister" and all but forget their first names. This is a symbolic but very real manifestation of their putting aside their own pursuits to be joined to the purposes of the Lord. Other names bring blessings and responsibilities: Mother, Father, Bishop, President.</p>
<p>Before record keeping began, most people had only one name, such as John. As the population increased, it became necessary to distinguish between individuals with the same name. Descriptive information had to be added, such as John Christiansen (son of Christian), John Geldzahler (gold counter), or John Rotkoph (redhead).</p>
<p>This practice still happens today. Elder Packer told of one young boy who, until he was four years old, thought his name was Johnny . . . Stop. Sometimes we use as names or as nouns words that would be less limiting as adjectives. Have you ever heard parents say, "Oh, hes our athlete" or "Shes our scholar" - as if we only have to be one thing. Our naming or descriptions may unintentionally limit a persons self-image: "Oh, shes our little tomboy" or "I guess he is our black sheep" (as if we each had to have one). A label is attached when a person may only be showing a temporary interest or a momentary struggle. Beware of names that are negative or limiting.</p>
<p>You might ask your parents how your name was selected. Listen to what Helaman tells his sons Nephi and Lehi about their names:</p>
<p><i>Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i></p>
<p><i>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good. </i>[Helaman 5:67]</p>
<p>Nephi and Lehi carried in their names the identity of the good works of their ancestors. Just as your name gives identity to you, your behavior can give identity to your own name. When you are born, the identity is given to you as your parents give you your name. An infants identity is attached to the parents or caregivers. Children gradually enlarge their identity to family and even belongings, then later to friends, school, labels, styles. Yet we are reminded in Proverbs "Even a child is known by his doings" (20:11). Lets consider the identity we get through attachments. I remember many years ago attending a high school basketball tournament after my own children had all graduated. I had somehow forgotten the noise and enthusiasm of such an event. As we found our places in the upper balconies surrounded by students with the right colors, I quickly evaluated the appropriate behavior for the occasion. In my detached state, the scene momentarily became rather humorous to me. A student observing my momentary stupor seemed to increase his volume as he chanted, his eyes bulging and the veins prominently standing out on his neck: "Were Number One! Were Number One! Were Number One!" Something devious in me wanted so badly to whisper, "Number one what?" All we had done was buy a three-dollar ticket.</p>
<p>Were Number One - I call that identity by attachment. My team is outstanding, therefore I am outstanding. A bit temporary but a good feeling nonetheless. We might consider some of those attachments that give us temporary identity. It is easy to get stuck there. The right club, the right car, the right clothes may seem who we are - identity by attachment. There is danger in this. The Savior warned, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 14:21). But he warned the hypocrite, "And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you" (verse 23). Strengthening our identity with our Heavenly Father takes a different kind of commitment. It has much more to do with our behavior than our belongings. Usually as a person matures spiritually, more of identity comes from developing ones own talents and increasing ones ability to serve others. As you mature, your life and characteristics will give identity to your name. Your work and behavior will better define who you are.</p>
<p>Perhaps many of you have read the story of President George Albert Smith that he referred to as "Your Good Name." He described an experience he had in his later years.</p>
<p><i>I became so weak as to be scarcely able to move. It was a slow and exhausting effort for me even to turn over in bed.</i></p>
<p><i>One day, under these conditions, I lost consciousness of my surroundings and thought I had passed to the Other Side.</i></p>
<p>George Albert Smith described what he saw and then wrote:</p>
<p><i>I saw a man coming towards me. I became aware that he was a very large man, and I hurried my steps to reach him, because I recognized him as my grandfather. . . . I remember how happy I was to see him coming. I had been given his name and had always been proud of it.</i></p>
<p><i>When Grandfather came within a few feet of me, he stopped. His stopping was an invitation for me to stop. Then - and this I would like the . . . young people never to forget - he looked at me very earnestly and said:</i></p>
<p><i>"I would like to know what you have done with my name."</i></p>
<p><i>Everything I had ever done passed before me as though it were a flying picture on a screen - everything I had done. Quickly this vivid retrospect came down to the very time I was standing there. My whole life had passed before me. I smiled and looked at my grandfather and said:</i></p>
<p><i>"I have never done anything with your name of which you need be ashamed."</i></p>
<p><i>He stepped forward and took me in his arms, and as he did so, I became conscious again of my earthly surroundings. My pillow was as wet as though water had been poured on it - wet with tears of gratitude that I could answer unashamed.</i></p>
<p>President Smith continued:</p>
<p><i>I have thought of this many times, and I want to tell you that I have been trying, more than ever since that time, to take care of that name. So I want to say to </i>. . .<i>the young men and women, to the youth of the Church and of all the world: Honor your fathers and your mothers. Honor the names that you bear, because some day you will have the privilege and the obligation of reporting to them (and to your Father in heaven) what you have done with their name. </i>[George Albert Smith, <i>Sharing the Gospel with Others </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1948), p. 11112]</p>
<p>What a wonderful heritage George Albert Smith had received from his grandfather, and he was able to continue that righteous tradition. Perhaps some would relate more, however, to the experience of a young woman who shared her story in the <i>New Era. </i>This young woman, a convert, came from such a wildly dysfunctional family that she decided she had bad blood. She felt second class to lifelong Church members she considered "born in the covenant." Through a priesthood blessing the young woman was told that the story of Ruth had a special message for her. She read the story but at first didnt understand the significance. She writes what happened:</p>
<p><i>Finally, through the Spirit, it came to me. The key was at the very end of the book, where it mentions Ruths part in the lineage of . . . Christ. Ruth, . . . the convert from a foreign land, showed such great faith that she became an integral part of the most blessed bloodline of all. This great woman, who came from generations of idol worshipers, would be a forebear of the Savior of the world. </i>[Kay Hago, "From One of the Best Families," <i>New Era, </i>June 1991, p.20]</p>
<p>The young woman added that just one scripture story helped her find her place in life and the kingdom by teaching that no blessing would be withheld from her because she wasnt born to LDS parents. She found out she came from the best of families, our Heavenly Fathers family. As this woman strengthened her identity with our Heavenly Father, she felt differently about her potential and her purpose in life.</p>
<p>We have accounts in biblical history when the change of a persons name becomes a symbol of a major change in a persons life. When the Lord appeared to Abram when he was ninety-nine, he said:</p>
<p><i>Walk before me, and be thou perfect. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</i></p>
<p><i>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. </i>[Genesis 17:15]</p>
<p>Jacobs name was changed to Israel at the time he saw God (see Genesis 32:28). The apostle Paul was known as Saul in his early life, but he was called Paul after the beginning of his ministry (see Acts 13:9).</p>
<p>A friend pointed out that Pauls references as he introduced himself changed as his ministry progressed. In Corinthians he referred to himself as an apostle and later as a servant (see Romans, Philippians, and Titus), a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and a fellow laborer (see Philemon).</p>
<p>It is interesting that as Pauls ministry progressed, his self-identity seemed to become less important or at least secondary to his work in representing the name of Jesus Christ and His teachings in establishing the Church. He had strengthened his identity with our Heavenly Father, and Gods purpose became his purpose.</p>
<p>As I considered changing my name, I thought perhaps I could learn to be a better person. After deciding to remarry, there were many decisions to be made, such as where we would live. It seems a bit immature now that I think about it, but none of the decisions seemed more important to me than what I would be called. I had been Janette C. Hales for forty years, and it bothered me when one of my children said, "I guess we wont be the Hales family any more." Of course we will, but they had to think through their mother having a different name. When the marriage announcements went out, someone from the Church magazines called the Young Women office and asked what I would be called after my marriage. My secretary instructed very clearly that I would be Janette Hales Beckham. The person on the other end of the line asked, "But will she be Sister Hales or Sister Beckham?"</p>
<p>A friend of mine suggested I might try her husbands advice to her: "If you give a poor talk, use your maiden name."</p>
<p>I remember well the day my first granddaughter was blessed and named Emily Janette. Her parents had chosen to give her my name. My heart reached out as her father, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, took her in his arms and gave her a name and a blessing. I found myself wanting all the best for this little granddaughter. As I expressed my love and bore my testimony that day, I thought how my feelings must be in small measure how our Heavenly Father must feel as we take upon us the name of His Son, Jesus Christ. I am reminded that He wants all the best for us. With His name we have the opportunity to become changed and take upon ourselves His attributes.</p>
<p>For little Emily, now four years old, as well as for each one of us, this requires learning and experience as well as a great deal of commitment. Although we are each innocent at birth, we are basically self-centered, lacking in experience, and quite intent on survival.</p>
<p>At baptism Emily will take upon herself the name of Jesus Christ as most of us have done. That responsibility and blessing becomes our new identity. Attend baptisms. Listen to the words. I believe we have to make a conscious effort to strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Attend confirmations. Listen to the blessings when the Holy Ghost is given. We must each remind ourselves of our eternal identity.</p>
<p>Recently a young woman wrote to me with concerns about her progress. She wrote:</p>
<p><i>I have been wondering about making it back to our Heavenly Father. Worried is more like it. My mom once told me that to worry is to lack faith in God, so using that word kind of makes me cringe. But, to me I feel if I dont make it even when I try my hardest, it will be the biggest disappointment. I guess you could say that I have </i>little <i>faith. </i>Little <i>everything is more like it. You asked us what is the biggest problem facing the </i>[young people] <i>in the Church today. Among the answers some gave were drugs, alcohol, things like that. While those, along with teenage pregnancies, are rich among the community, I dont think that those are the main problems. Yes in the world, but not in the Church. To me, I see struggling to know who we are. Struggling to know the truth, wanting to be loved and cherished for what we do, needing lots of hugs and "I love yous," needing to feel needed.</i></p>
<p>This is a wonderful letter - so normal, so honest, so sincere. Sometimes we feel our faith is "little" when it is really just young and inexperienced. Sometimes when we add a long list of emotional needs to our need to know who we are, we confuse the issue. Focusing on finding ways to strengthen your personal identity will very likely help get some of the other needs met in the proper time. You do strengthen your identity with our Heavenly Father when you practice doing the things He has asked you to do.</p>
<p>How can you strengthen your own personal identity? I can tell you how in three simple words. Do good things! If that sounds too simplistic, lets try three other words. Keep the commandments! I could continue. Do more good! Love one another! Serve one another! I could continue. Keep a journal! President Spencer W. Kimball said through keeping a journal we come to know ourselves (see <i>TSWK, </i>p. 351; also see "President Kimball Speaks Out on Personal Journals,"<i>Ensign, </i>December 1980, p. 61). Three words that can mean so much: Be more Christlike!</p>
<p>The search for identity and purpose is fundamental to everyone. The scriptures are filled with events in the lives of those searching for answers to these fundamental questions. We read of the struggles of those who found false identity.</p>
<p>In Alma 1 we read of a man, "and his name was Nehor" (verse 15), "and he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel" (verse 6). And the people who found their identity in his false teachings "began to be proud" (verse 22). As those contentious people caused affliction to the Church, we read in Alma 1:24: "The hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God."</p>
<p>Alma himself recounts to his son Helaman his own search for identity: "For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way" (Alma 36:6).</p>
<p>Alma had such remorse for the awful things he had done, he longed to be nonexistent. In his words, "Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body" (Alma 36:15). Then, as he continues to relate the torment he suffered remembering his sins, he said, "I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world" (verse 17). Alma was again in touch with his divine identity through a loving Savior. Speaking again to Helaman:</p>
<p><i>Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i></p>
<p><i>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</i></p>
<p><i>But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God. </i>[Alma 36:2123]</p>
<p>In the Church we learn about our identity very young in our families. In family home evening and in Primary we sing "I am a child of God." Children strengthen their identity as they learn to be nice, dont hit, help mommy; but it becomes more complex: say youre sorry, tell the truth, do your homework, forgive your brother, say your prayers.</p>
<p>As we grow and live and learn, as we love and serve one another, we understand how our choices, our behavior, help us become who we are. Alma warned his son Corianton that "wickedness never was happiness" (see Alma 41:10). He teaches him that the kind of person or the identity he develops in this life is the identity he will have in the Resurrection.</p>
<p><i>Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</i></p>
<p><i>For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored. </i>[Alma 41:1415]</p>
<p>Alma understood the change and the behavior that helps us develop our divine and eternal identity. Bruce R. McConkie spoke of the doctrine of the new birth:</p>
<p><i>There is a natural birth, and there is a spiritual birth. . . . The natural birth creates a natural man, and the natural man is an enemy to God. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>The spiritual birth comes after the natural birth. . . . It is to begin a new life, . . . a spiritual life. </i>[Bruce R. McConkie, <i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 282]</p>
<p>For Alma, the change took place in a dramatic way. For many, it is a gradual change. Those changes in behavior can best be observed as we see good people become refined spiritually as they serve and sacrifice and honor eternal covenants.</p>
<p>Just prior to my first husbands death, he spoke in a ward conference. He told of a couple who had been coming to him as patients for twenty-five years. In the early years one would drop the other at the office and then run errands while the eye examination took place.</p>
<p>As years passed, each spouse would wait while the other was being examined. As more years passed, he noticed the wife was the driver, and she would assist her husband as he came into the office. Then they started coming to the examining room together. In time the wife started coming to the office alone. My husband inquired about her husbands health. She explained that she wasnt able to lift or care for him alone anymore and he was living in a rest home. She said, "I go every day, but I dont believe he even knows me. This morning I said, Clarence, do you know who I am?" He studied her face carefully and then said, "No, but I know youre someone who loves me." Perhaps that is all that really matters. Are you recognized as one who loves others?</p>
<p>Life is about learning how to be more like our Savior, to strengthen our identity with Him. We learn to sacrifice our wants for the needs of others. We learn to love as He loved.</p>
<p>Our prophets have said there is only one name under heaven whereby man can be saved. It is the name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;C 18:23).</p>
<p>Does changing my name make me a different person? I want to be a better person. Marriage gives me new opportunity to love, share, and serve; but changing my name was also a reminder of the importance of a name and the blessing of His name, the name of Jesus Christ. Each one of us through the Atonement can leave behind that identity that would hold us back or tear us down. We can repent, forgive, forget. We can strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father as we change and as we serve. There are many characteristics in the scriptures that distinguish a righteous people - those who take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Do any of you experience feelings of trauma or self-doubt when you are going through times of change - a new school year, a new job, a mission? There is great opportunity that comes with change. That is the way the gospel works in our lives. We have the opportunity to change, to become better, to strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father. Perhaps this year will be a significant time for you to strengthen your identity in good ways.</p>
<p>As we each consider our own names,</p>
<p>I believe the scriptures will be a helpful guide: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches" (Proverbs 22:1).</p>
<p>The Savior warned of those who would have a false identity.</p>
<p><i>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</i></p>
<p><i>Ye shall know them by their fruits. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. </i>[Matthew 7:1516, 18, 20]</p>
<p>As we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father, it is important that we revere the name of God and His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. </i>[Exodus 20:7]</p>
<p>As we follow the teachings of our Heavenly Father, it is important that we respect and revere the names of one another. I read a study by the National School Safety Center. The centers executive director, Ronald G. Stephens, stated that "fourth-through-12th graders around the nation . . . mentioned name-calling, cursing or staring . . . as the most common triggers for violence" (quoted in Ellen Graham, "Language of Childhood: No Expletives Deleted," <i>The Wall Street Journal, </i>17 July 1995, p. B-1).</p>
<p>The old saying "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me" is probably not true. We should use respectful names and respect the proper names of others. Our Heavenly Father would expect that of us. As the Lord has told us, He will not hold those guiltless who take His name in vain. The Lord has also told us that he will not forsake those that know his name and trust in him (see Psalms 9:910).</p>
<p>Surely our Heavenly Father could recognize us as His children if our behavior resembled those who believe on His name.</p>
<p>In Moroni we read:</p>
<p><i>And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.</i></p>
<p><i>And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith. </i>[Moroni 6:34]</p>
<p>The changing of a name is symbolic. The change in us must be real. As we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father, surely it will be evident in our behavior.</p>
<p>President Hinckley has spoken to us regarding our divine identity. He has said:</p>
<p><i>You are </i>[sons and daughters] <i>of God, each of you, endowed with something of his divinity. It is a part of your eternal nature. You cannot afford to live beneath that portion of divinity. </i>. . .</p>
<p><i>You will not need to be reminded to be virtuous, you will not need to be reminded to be clean, if you will remember always that you are </i>[sons and daughters] <i>of God, that a portion of his divinity is within you, and that you must make an accounting to him. </i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>The Wonderful Thing That Is You and the Wonderful Good You Can Do </i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1988), pp. 3, 8]</p>
<p>May we remember as we partake of the sacrament each Sunday the great blessing it is to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Listen to the words that we covenant with our Eternal Father:</p>
<p><i>That </i>[we] <i>are willing to take upon </i>[us] <i>the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given </i>[us], <i>that </i>[we] <i>may always have his Spirit to be with </i>[us]. [Moroni 4:3]</p>
<p>May we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father and remember that we have taken upon ourselves the name of His Son is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Six years ago President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave a profound conference talk entitled "You Matter to Him."1 In his talk he explained that God is the Creator of all things and yet is concerned about each one of us individually. Today I would like to build upon President Uchtdorfs topic and title my remarks "BYU Matters to Him." However, I would like to redefine the acronym for Brigham Young University as B-Y-You, as in you (y-o-u). Thus the title of my address is "B-Y-You Matter to Him."
This past semester one of my students submitted the following account. With her permission, I share her tender feelings about when she first arrived at BYU:
 Leaving everything you have known for the entirety of your life to attend a university that is 547 miles away is difficult. You can no longer lean on the support of your family and friends; you can no longer enjoy the safety and security of your home; you can no longer simply follow your parents. Your life is in your own hands, and it is terrifying. I distinctly remember the hurricane of emotions I experienced as I bid farewell to my dad as he drove away, leaving me standing outside my dorm with five people I had never met. I had to make my own food, and I felt sorely unprepared. Actually, I felt more than unprepared - I felt absolutely and entirely lost.
My student then went on to describe her feelings that day as those of "ultimate vulnerability."2
As I pondered my students feelings of vulnerability and isolation, I felt a personal surge of deja vu from when I first arrived at BYU some forty-seven years ago. My students account stirred within me some tender and painful emotions from decades past. I suspect that many of you here today can also recall the daunting memories of when you first arrived on this campus. As I address you today, perhaps some of you find yourself in the throes of similar feelings of trepidation or of being lost.
The Greatness of BYU
I do not mean to minimize these feelings of loneliness or intimidation, but they present a marked contrast to the feelings we first had when we were accepted to BYU. Consider the following glossy accolades and advantages of attending Brigham Young University.
BYU consistently ranks in the top 25 percent of national universities.3 BYU is in the top five of the best value universities4 and costs around $30,000 less per year than other private schools.5 Consequently, BYU students graduate with substantially less debt.6 BYU is the number-one stone-cold sober university,7 and students will never have to tolerate drunk classmates or professors. Also, BYU has launched more of its students into PhD programs than Harvard, Yale, or Stanford.8 Upon arrival, every student here has a church unit waiting to receive and support them. Additionally, more than 60 percent of the students</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I tell people I am a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics and English Language, I am often asked, "How many languages do you speak?" Or they may react and say, "Oh, Id better watch my grammar." While it is true that linguists study language, they study it in many different ways, not just by learning languages or by watching for grammar mistakes. I would like to give you a taste of what some of the linguists in our department and college do.
A few of my colleagues study and describe lesser-known languages - some that are spoken in North America, such as the Ute and Salish languages, along with other languages spoken around the world, such as Quichua, Xinkan, and Marshallese. Other colleagues study older forms of language, such as Old, Middle, and Early Modern English, with some examining how language has changed over time. Others investigate the language rules we are taught and which rules are useful to us today. One colleague studies how ambiguity in language - that is, how words or sentences can have more than one meaning - is applied in advertising. Others study how the pronunciation, words, and grammar of a language vary from one region or group to another. Another colleague has dedicated many years to researching the language in the Book of Mormon and constructing its original text. Some use technology to solve difficult and complex language problems. Others use databases containing millions of words to find language patterns, while others look for words and language patterns used by specific writers. Another group focuses on how languages are learned, particularly second languages, with some investigating the best ways to accurately measure proficiency in a language.
This research has been applied to a number of real-world problems by supporting language-preservation projects, creating language-frequency dictionaries and academic vocabulary lists, helping missionaries learn languages and assessing their progress, and extracting genealogical facts from texts in a fraction of the time it used to take.
These are just a few examples, but as you can see, there is much diversity in what my colleagues study; however, one thing they have in common is that they are passionate about and engaged in their research and teaching. While they have different stories of how they were led to study linguistics, they all have dedicated much of their time and effort to making their unique contributions to our field.
You do not have to be a linguist to be interested in language. You may have noticed differences in your own language or in others language when you came here to BYU or as you have traveled to different places. Some of you may have taken surveys available online that sometimes quite accurately pinpoint the area of the country you are from. These surveys include questions about how you pronounce different words. How do you pronounce these words: mountain, crayon, caramel? Do you p</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, friends. A few months ago I had the opportunity to travel to Italy for the first time. While there I saw art created by the great masters: Michelangelo, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, and many others. In Milan I was able to see the famed The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci. This mural is in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and to see it one must purchase tickets ahead of time and wait for ones fifteen minutes with the painting. When my time drew near, I was corralled with twenty-four others into a waiting area, guided through two air-locked chambers, and finally allowed in front of the painting for fifteen minutes of communion.
As I sat there I contemplated the painting and why it is considered priceless - the value of which is beyond measure. Is it because the painting is old, created in the fifteenth century? Is it because of where it is located - in Milan? Is it because access is limited - few people can see it, so it is more valuable than paintings just anyone can see? Is it because it has been threatened in the past - like when Napoleon used the convent as an armory, a prison, and a stable or when it was partially destroyed by bombs during World War II? Is it because it was painted in an unconventional style - on a dry wall versus in the wet plaster - making it more fragile and rare? Is it because of who painted it - the great master da Vinci? Is it because of its subject?
These questions and others I chewed on while sitting and looking at this painting. Id like to say that I came up with profound answers that shook me to my core, but instead I came up with more questions. How do we measure value? What makes something - and, more important, someone - of worth?
Defining Value
As a professor of literature and culture, it is my job to look at systems of meaning and value, language being the first and foremost. If we go to the Oxford English Dictionary - the fifth standard work for all English majors - excerpts from the entry for the word value (n) read:
 worth or quality as measured by a standard of equivalence
 a standard of estimation or exchange
 [something] worth having
 material or monetary worth of something
 an appraisement
 relative rank or importance
 worth based on esteem
 estimation [based on] real or supposed desirability or utility [later extended] to an individual or group
 opinion of or liking for a person or thing
 worth or worthiness . . . in respect of rank1
According to these definitions, a things value is contingent on ideas of estimation, desirability, likeability, and worthiness. It is at the center of the word evaluate - to analyze - yet often we do not ask the questions, Who determines the system of val</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In his much-quoted talk on dating versus hanging out, Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:
A message given by a General Authority at a general conference . . . is given to be heard under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, with the intended result that the listener learns from the talk and from the Spirit what he or she should do about it. ["The Dedication of a Lifetime," CES fireside for young adults, Oakland, California, 1 May 2005; emphasis in original]
No one is more aware than your speaker today that you are not, in this gathering, listening to a General Authority at a general conference. However, I hope the same principle will apply: that something you hear in the words of the prophets and the scriptures we will consider this morning will impress upon your mind and heart something you personally "should do about it."
President Gordon B. Hinckley has repeatedly emphasized a harsh reality of which you are all aware. He has said, "The world into which you will move will be terribly competitive" ("Words of the Prophet: A Chosen Generation," New Era, January 1999, 6). He has also said, "You are moving into the most competitive age the world has ever known. All around you is competition" ("A Prophets Counsel and Prayer for Youth," Ensign, January 2001, 4). In general conference in April 2007, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said that our culture has an "obsession with comparing [and] competing" ("The Tongue of Angels," Ensign, May 2007, 17).
This morning I would like to review with you certain principles taught in the scriptures and by living prophets that relate to comparing and competing, first in our academic and professional lives, then more generally in our personal lives.
Preparation
One way to deal with academic and professional competition was recommended to me by my graduate advisor. He said, "The most important thing you need to do in graduate school is to impress the right people." I thought that the gospel teaches us that we arent supposed to do things to "be seen of men" (Matthew 6:5), to call attention to ourselves, and to "aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;C 121:35). And yet my advisor seemed to be saying that if I was going to succeed as a graduate student, thats exactly what I needed to do.
Of course there is truth in my advisors observation. Obviously, if you dont impress the coach, you dont make the team; if you dont impress an employer, you dont get the job. Many seek to impress others and aspire to the honors of men by deliberately calling attention to themselves. Jesus chastised those in His time who did "all their works . . . to be seen of men" (Matthew 23:5).
In April 2007 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer said:
To seek after the praise of men, the scriptures caution us, is to be led carefully away from the only safe path to f</span>
