  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am very grateful to be here and am pleased to be present at the moment when this basketball team is honored. I am deeply sincere in expressing appreciation for what they did during the season that brought great honor and distinction to this school and to all of us. Nothing but the highest praise should be given them for their actions and their representation of this school.

There are two things with which I have been preoccupied for a long time and which I have found myself teaching in whatever class by whatever name and from whatever forum or pulpit as I have addressed or taught Church people. Moved as I am by what I just heard, I am almost unwilling to be facetious, but I would like to be, deliberately, for a moment, and tell you a story that I resurrected this morning as I drove here. It is one I haven’t thought of for a long time.

It is the story of two very good friends in a small town who were practical jokers and who expressed this interesting facet of personality on the other, or at his expense, quite frequently. These two men happened to be the mayor and the undertaker. As I get the story, one day repeated telephone calls came to the mayor’s home and into the night, telling him that there was a dead donkey on a certain street and that as mayor it was his responsibility to take care of the matter. The phone calls came so frequently that the mayor thought he had better see, although he suspected that there was some skulduggery afoot. In fact, when he went there, there was a dead jackass in the street. He had a city truck come and pick it up, and feeling sure now who was the perpetrator of this interesting experience, he had the animal deposited on the undertaker’s front porch, saying, “It’s your responsibility to take care of the dead.” This the undertaker did, then sent the bill to the mayor with the message that where there were no immediate family survivors, “we always bill the next of kin.”

I was a little reluctant to tell that for fear you might make too good an application in terms of what I am going to say. I had better tell you the other thing I thought of on the way, too. This was expressed by Dr. George Harper, a wonderful young Methodist minister with whom I teamed up at a Religious Emphasis Week in another part of the country some time ago.

It was a very interesting experience. Dr. Harper was very young and vigorous, and I was a little younger then; and because only five people showed up at the first joint meeting we held, we decided we had better stir up a little enthusiasm. So we challenged their handball champions and beat them, whereupon several hundred students came to subsequent meetings to look over the old fellows who could do this. We had a very interesting Religious Emphasis Week from that time on. People are inclined to listen a little more interestedly to those who do something else besides preach religion.

The two ideas that I have been thinking about and talking about for as long as I can remember are these:

First, the Latter-day Saint has a relationship with other men that is important in its meaning. It is not a relationship of superiority. It is not one of smugness. It is not one of withdrawal from the active brotherhood that the world must have if the world is to be what it can be. No Latter-day Saint who understands his religion, if I understand it correctly, could appropriately withdraw from the active scene to a kind of a chimney corner of self-congratulation and snuggle to his bosom the great blessings God has given him, feeling that there is some inherent superiority in him because he is a member of the Church. He could not with any validity look upon his fellow men with any sense of personal arrogance or smugness, because he is committed to the religious truth that all men are literally the children of Almighty God, that each of us is the spirit child of a Heavenly Father who loves us and by whom we are esteemed as one, who is as concerned and interested in the least of men as He is in the most seemingly righteous of men, who establishes and preserves laws which when lived produce blessings, which when broken result in sad consequences; but a God who, though He will not protect men from the effects of their own bad choices, unceasingly, unremittingly, unreservedly, unconditionally loves the individual.

If this is true, and I testify that it is, then no member of a church believing itself to be the true Church of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, would ever be found derogating or casting bad light upon or impugning the worthwhileness or the virtue or the value of other individuals. In other words, there are in this world vast numbers of choice human beings—children of God whom He loves and to whom our responsiveness as their brothers and sisters should be directed. There are around us—in our own neighborhoods, in this school, in every community of Latter-day Saints—choice, wholesome, wonderful people who are not like us, not of us, who sometimes know very little about us (and often know much that isn’t so), and yet who are persons of integrity, honor, commitment, kindness, compassion, consideration, and all the other wholesome virtues that we would seek to develop in ourselves. Sometimes I think that our young people occasionally get the notion—and they must get it from some who are a little older—that if people are different, they are less important or virtuous. If they are not like us, there must be something a little bit suspicious about them. If this notion exists—and to some small measure I believe it does—we should eradicate it. We should begin to accept the implications of our relationship with God and our fellow men and rejoice in them and recognize that there is not and will not be a complete unanimity of human opinion in matters of spiritual importance. This I believe.

May I illustrate it with a statement or two from the best sources I know beyond the scriptures themselves—and they would illustrate it very well if we were to turn to them.

From the pen of Joseph Smith:

&lt;i&gt;We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.&lt;/i&gt; [Articles of Faith 1:11]

&lt;i&gt;The Saints can testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. &lt;/i&gt;[And not long after, he did.] &lt;i&gt;If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a “Mormon.” I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination; for the same principle which would trample upon the rights of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of the Roman Catholics, or of any other denomination who may be unpopular and too weak to defend themselves.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 5:498]

I believe he meant it, and because I believe he was a prophet of God, I am very anxious to be considerate of what he said.

One other which I believe to be as fine a statement as has been made, from the same source:

&lt;i&gt;We ought always to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely present themselves, and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends, neighbors, and brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and in matters of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is between them and their God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is a love from God that should be exercised toward those of our faith, who walk uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is without prejudice; it also gives scope to the mind, which enables us to conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards all that are not of our faith, than what they exercise towards one another.&lt;/i&gt; [HC 3:303–4]

Isn’t that wonderful?

Yes, there is a special feeling of brotherhood when you go into a little island that the enemy had held just a few hours before and you find a little handful of choice youngsters who have survived a terrible bloodletting—you find that they are meeting as Latter-day Saints. You join them, and you testify with them and take the sacrament and sing and pray and rejoice in their brotherhood. Yes, there is a special feeling, but it is without prejudice. It ought to move us to treat others who are not of us with greater love than they exercise toward each other.

I conceive myself to be committed to that program; and to the extent that I do not understand it or fail to comport my life with it, I am not representing the truths of the gospel.

Now, what is the other big point I want to testify about? In the light of what I have said, and believing it with all my heart, I know that there are certain wonderful truths that God has given us and expects us to share with our fellow men which will bless the life of the finest human being who does not have them and who will learn them and live them. Those are my two great convictions, and they fit together. They are meaningful. They permit me—if I am somewhere nearly as big as my concepts—not alone to tolerate but to love and accept and find virtue and goodness in other men.

A choice man of the Pentecostal faith aboard my ship taught me more about our relationship with the Savior than I taught him. There was also the wonderful Christian Scientist whose mouth and mind were clean and who was like a beacon in the middle of a lot of dirt and darkness. This concept permits me to love them and respect them and wish I were more like them in many ways and yet to share with them some great truths they did not know and to watch their lives change.

Oh, this is a solemn, sweet blessing and one that all of us could enjoy if we would. You see, there is no room in it for hypocrisy, bigotry, unkindness, ungraciousness, lack of compassion, or lack of respect. All of these are implicit in the ability to share. You cannot touch the heart of a man over whose head there hovers the sense of your prejudice and your closed mind and your unfriendly, unfeeling, unkind response to him. You cannot possibly lift or heighten the vision of anyone who sees in you so narrow and senseless a bigotry that he doesn’t want to be like you or listen to anything you have to say. This does not mean that only perfect people can teach the gospel or else none of us would ever try, but it means that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;with an appropriate understanding of our relationship to God and other men we are ready to start. We are ready to share whatever good things we have, and say to those who have so much that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is so good (and sometimes superior to some things some of us represent): “Keep every good thing you have, and then listen to the additional word of the Lord in our time for our good.”

Let me take just a few minutes to mention an idea or two of particular value that we as individuals may seek to share. We just came from England a few months ago where we had the joyful blessing of meeting other multitudes of choice children of God. We discovered that there are certain basic truths the Church represents almost uniquely as an institution, though there are many wonderful individuals who believe with all their hearts these things that are of vital, indispensable importance in this world.

Let me illustrate one of them by a quotation from a Church of England magazine. I read it objectively and with no sense of criticism. It is written by an Anglican about an Anglican bishop, and I only extract a sentence or two to give you the sense of what he is saying:

&lt;i&gt;What should happen to an Anglican bishop who does not believe in God? This, I hold, is the condition of the Bishop of Woolwich, as revealed in his paperback, &lt;/i&gt;Honest to God, &lt;i&gt;and it raises, I maintain, a question of Church discipline which cannot be shirked.&lt;/i&gt; [C. S. Lewis, “Must Our Image of God Go?” &lt;i&gt;The Observer,&lt;/i&gt; 24 March 1963, 14]

He talks about the degenerative process by which faith in Almighty God has become unspeakable in a sense.

&lt;i&gt;The avowed object of the exercise is to make religion acceptable to the irreligious—to prove that it is possible to be in reality a Christian without believing in the teachings of the Church, and to accept God without using the word.&lt;/i&gt;

Much else is so very good, but let me read his conclusion:

&lt;i&gt;It is one thing to restate the eternal truths of religion in contemporary language and quite another expressly to repudiate fundamental truths which were believed by those who learned Christianity from the lips of Christ. It is not always clear indeed whether the Bishop’s aim is to convince agnostics that they can conscientiously go to church or to persuade Christians that there is no real need to do so. At the lowest he seems to me to be violating the principles of honest commerce by trying to sell as Christian a commodity that bears no relation to the historical and accepted meaning of that word.&lt;/i&gt;

I want to tell you there is need in the world for a simple expression of conviction about God—the same kind of conviction that every prophet who wrote expressed and that the Lord Jesus Christ represented in its fulness in His teachings and in His life. The God of the scriptures, the God who lives, the Almighty, Eternal Father of mankind whom we do not in large measure comprehend because His ways are not our ways, but who has Himself revealed Himself to us in a modern day to reaffirm and reassert the reality of His personal nature—that we are made in His image, that we are in His likeness, that we have in us the rudimentary qualities which He represents in their fulness.

Oh, maybe this is just Mormon talk that you have heard all your lives, to some of you, but I want to tell you that I have been to some places where they don’t have it, and I have seen what they have instead, and I want to share with them—those who are willing to love and understand and worship the God that all the prophets knew and that we have a right to know.

This is a truth that will lift the lives of the finest human beings who do not know it. The truth about the Savior, the truth about man and the nature of man, is so brutally demeaned in historical Christianity, and now in contemporary offshoots. Yet we belong to a Church that teaches that man was in the beginning with God, and that far from imposing upon humankind, “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy” (2 Nephi 2:25) .

It is a Church that teaches us that this body of ours, so much with us, is an eternal component of our soul, that it is a non-evil eternal component of our soul: “And the spirit and the body are the soul of man” (D&amp;amp;C 88:15).

We are committed to a concept of ecclesiastical organization established by Jesus Christ Himself. There is much to be said, and I leave it unsaid; but I tell you it is important, and it is good for men to know, who seek something to give allegiance to and something to serve and share, because men must have this privilege if they are going to enjoy the growth toward godhood that God wants them to have. We believe in the truth about the plan of salvation, the perpetuity of human personality, the long and marvelous march toward spiritual maturity that life ought to involve, with its roadblocks and its side trips and its sad follies.

In these and so many other wonderfully basic important ways we have something to give good people. I want to mention also that in addition to answers to some very important problems, the Church really does have direction and strength to offer good human beings who want to walk with joy in this world.

I want to read a few verses of scripture and ask you to listen with great care from the fifth chapter of the book of Alma. I might have prefaced it with the statement of the Savior, “What manner of men ought ye to be?” (3 Nephi 27:27)—we who profess this great wonderful message. Let me read this:

&lt;i&gt;Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? &lt;/i&gt;[I skip a few lines to emphasize significant questions. This, the prophet is asking us.]

&lt;i&gt;Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 5:27–31]

There is one other note I want to mention in conclusion about that which is useful to other men. Good men want it. Honest men, when they see it or sense it or feel its presence, often recognize it and comment about it.

Let me read to you a note I received a little time ago, after a war had concluded and a man was seeking to settle something he had felt and questioned:

&lt;i&gt;Dear Sirs:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I am writing this letter in accordance with my will and a desire which was a result of a few hours in an army hospital. There I met a soldier who was a Mormon. I became interested in his religion. Through him I received words that have lived. Since then I have read a Book of Mormon. I would like to receive information as to where I may purchase other books on the Mormon religion so I may find understanding and find wisdom.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have a great desire burning within my heart to learn of this religion, even to partake of it. This Mormon soldier, he had something far greater than any other man I ever met. Where is the nearest Mormon Temple to me?&lt;/i&gt;

I would like to tell you that there are a lot of marvelous people in this world who are just as fine and just as commendable in their integrity and honor as the best of us, but that there is in the Church of Jesus Christ and in the restored gospel that which can lift and strengthen and ennoble and exalt the finest life that does not have it, that will consider and hearken to the revealed word of God. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I am very grateful to be here and am pleased to be present at the moment when this basketball team is honored. I am deeply sincere in expressing appreciation for what they did during the season that brought great honor and distinction to this school and to all of us. Nothing but the highest praise should be given them for their actions and their representation of this school.</p>
<p>There are two things with which I have been preoccupied for a long time and which I have found myself teaching in whatever class by whatever name and from whatever forum or pulpit as I have addressed or taught Church people. Moved as I am by what I just heard, I am almost unwilling to be facetious, but I would like to be, deliberately, for a moment, and tell you a story that I resurrected this morning as I drove here. It is one I haven’t thought of for a long time.</p>
<p>It is the story of two very good friends in a small town who were practical jokers and who expressed this interesting facet of personality on the other, or at his expense, quite frequently. These two men happened to be the mayor and the undertaker. As I get the story, one day repeated telephone calls came to the mayor’s home and into the night, telling him that there was a dead donkey on a certain street and that as mayor it was his responsibility to take care of the matter. The phone calls came so frequently that the mayor thought he had better see, although he suspected that there was some skulduggery afoot. In fact, when he went there, there was a dead jackass in the street. He had a city truck come and pick it up, and feeling sure now who was the perpetrator of this interesting experience, he had the animal deposited on the undertaker’s front porch, saying, “It’s your responsibility to take care of the dead.” This the undertaker did, then sent the bill to the mayor with the message that where there were no immediate family survivors, “we always bill the next of kin.”</p>
<p>I was a little reluctant to tell that for fear you might make too good an application in terms of what I am going to say. I had better tell you the other thing I thought of on the way, too. This was expressed by Dr. George Harper, a wonderful young Methodist minister with whom I teamed up at a Religious Emphasis Week in another part of the country some time ago.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting experience. Dr. Harper was very young and vigorous, and I was a little younger then; and because only five people showed up at the first joint meeting we held, we decided we had better stir up a little enthusiasm. So we challenged their handball champions and beat them, whereupon several hundred students came to subsequent meetings to look over the old fellows who could do this. We had a very interesting Religious Emphasis Week from that time on. People are inclined to listen a little more interestedly to those who do something else besides preach religion.</p>
<p>The two ideas that I have been thinking about and talking about for as long as I can remember are these:</p>
<p>First, the Latter-day Saint has a relationship with other men that is important in its meaning. It is not a relationship of superiority. It is not one of smugness. It is not one of withdrawal from the active brotherhood that the world must have if the world is to be what it can be. No Latter-day Saint who understands his religion, if I understand it correctly, could appropriately withdraw from the active scene to a kind of a chimney corner of self-congratulation and snuggle to his bosom the great blessings God has given him, feeling that there is some inherent superiority in him because he is a member of the Church. He could not with any validity look upon his fellow men with any sense of personal arrogance or smugness, because he is committed to the religious truth that all men are literally the children of Almighty God, that each of us is the spirit child of a Heavenly Father who loves us and by whom we are esteemed as one, who is as concerned and interested in the least of men as He is in the most seemingly righteous of men, who establishes and preserves laws which when lived produce blessings, which when broken result in sad consequences; but a God who, though He will not protect men from the effects of their own bad choices, unceasingly, unremittingly, unreservedly, unconditionally loves the individual.</p>
<p>If this is true, and I testify that it is, then no member of a church believing itself to be the true Church of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, would ever be found derogating or casting bad light upon or impugning the worthwhileness or the virtue or the value of other individuals. In other words, there are in this world vast numbers of choice human beings—children of God whom He loves and to whom our responsiveness as their brothers and sisters should be directed. There are around us—in our own neighborhoods, in this school, in every community of Latter-day Saints—choice, wholesome, wonderful people who are not like us, not of us, who sometimes know very little about us (and often know much that isn’t so), and yet who are persons of integrity, honor, commitment, kindness, compassion, consideration, and all the other wholesome virtues that we would seek to develop in ourselves. Sometimes I think that our young people occasionally get the notion—and they must get it from some who are a little older—that if people are different, they are less important or virtuous. If they are not like us, there must be something a little bit suspicious about them. If this notion exists—and to some small measure I believe it does—we should eradicate it. We should begin to accept the implications of our relationship with God and our fellow men and rejoice in them and recognize that there is not and will not be a complete unanimity of human opinion in matters of spiritual importance. This I believe.</p>
<p>May I illustrate it with a statement or two from the best sources I know beyond the scriptures themselves—and they would illustrate it very well if we were to turn to them.</p>
<p>From the pen of Joseph Smith:</p>
<p><i>We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.</i> [Articles of Faith 1:11]</p>
<p><i>The Saints can testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. </i>[And not long after, he did.] <i>If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a “Mormon.” I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination; for the same principle which would trample upon the rights of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of the Roman Catholics, or of any other denomination who may be unpopular and too weak to defend themselves.</i> [<i>HC</i> 5:498]</p>
<p>I believe he meant it, and because I believe he was a prophet of God, I am very anxious to be considerate of what he said.</p>
<p>One other which I believe to be as fine a statement as has been made, from the same source:</p>
<p><i>We ought always to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely present themselves, and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends, neighbors, and brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and in matters of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is between them and their God.</i></p>
<p><i>There is a love from God that should be exercised toward those of our faith, who walk uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is without prejudice; it also gives scope to the mind, which enables us to conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards all that are not of our faith, than what they exercise towards one another.</i> [HC 3:303–4]</p>
<p>Isn’t that wonderful?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a special feeling of brotherhood when you go into a little island that the enemy had held just a few hours before and you find a little handful of choice youngsters who have survived a terrible bloodletting—you find that they are meeting as Latter-day Saints. You join them, and you testify with them and take the sacrament and sing and pray and rejoice in their brotherhood. Yes, there is a special feeling, but it is without prejudice. It ought to move us to treat others who are not of us with greater love than they exercise toward each other.</p>
<p>I conceive myself to be committed to that program; and to the extent that I do not understand it or fail to comport my life with it, I am not representing the truths of the gospel.</p>
<p>Now, what is the other big point I want to testify about? In the light of what I have said, and believing it with all my heart, I know that there are certain wonderful truths that God has given us and expects us to share with our fellow men which will bless the life of the finest human being who does not have them and who will learn them and live them. Those are my two great convictions, and they fit together. They are meaningful. They permit me—if I am somewhere nearly as big as my concepts—not alone to tolerate but to love and accept and find virtue and goodness in other men.</p>
<p>A choice man of the Pentecostal faith aboard my ship taught me more about our relationship with the Savior than I taught him. There was also the wonderful Christian Scientist whose mouth and mind were clean and who was like a beacon in the middle of a lot of dirt and darkness. This concept permits me to love them and respect them and wish I were more like them in many ways and yet to share with them some great truths they did not know and to watch their lives change.</p>
<p>Oh, this is a solemn, sweet blessing and one that all of us could enjoy if we would. You see, there is no room in it for hypocrisy, bigotry, unkindness, ungraciousness, lack of compassion, or lack of respect. All of these are implicit in the ability to share. You cannot touch the heart of a man over whose head there hovers the sense of your prejudice and your closed mind and your unfriendly, unfeeling, unkind response to him. You cannot possibly lift or heighten the vision of anyone who sees in you so narrow and senseless a bigotry that he doesn’t want to be like you or listen to anything you have to say. This does not mean that only perfect people can teach the gospel or else none of us would ever try, but it means that<i> </i>with an appropriate understanding of our relationship to God and other men we are ready to start. We are ready to share whatever good things we have, and say to those who have so much that<i> </i>is so good (and sometimes superior to some things some of us represent): “Keep every good thing you have, and then listen to the additional word of the Lord in our time for our good.”</p>
<p>Let me take just a few minutes to mention an idea or two of particular value that we as individuals may seek to share. We just came from England a few months ago where we had the joyful blessing of meeting other multitudes of choice children of God. We discovered that there are certain basic truths the Church represents almost uniquely as an institution, though there are many wonderful individuals who believe with all their hearts these things that are of vital, indispensable importance in this world.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate one of them by a quotation from a Church of England magazine. I read it objectively and with no sense of criticism. It is written by an Anglican about an Anglican bishop, and I only extract a sentence or two to give you the sense of what he is saying:</p>
<p><i>What should happen to an Anglican bishop who does not believe in God? This, I hold, is the condition of the Bishop of Woolwich, as revealed in his paperback, </i>Honest to God, <i>and it raises, I maintain, a question of Church discipline which cannot be shirked.</i> [C. S. Lewis, “Must Our Image of God Go?” <i>The Observer,</i> 24 March 1963, 14]</p>
<p>He talks about the degenerative process by which faith in Almighty God has become unspeakable in a sense.</p>
<p><i>The avowed object of the exercise is to make religion acceptable to the irreligious—to prove that it is possible to be in reality a Christian without believing in the teachings of the Church, and to accept God without using the word.</i></p>
<p>Much else is so very good, but let me read his conclusion:</p>
<p><i>It is one thing to restate the eternal truths of religion in contemporary language and quite another expressly to repudiate fundamental truths which were believed by those who learned Christianity from the lips of Christ. It is not always clear indeed whether the Bishop’s aim is to convince agnostics that they can conscientiously go to church or to persuade Christians that there is no real need to do so. At the lowest he seems to me to be violating the principles of honest commerce by trying to sell as Christian a commodity that bears no relation to the historical and accepted meaning of that word.</i></p>
<p>I want to tell you there is need in the world for a simple expression of conviction about God—the same kind of conviction that every prophet who wrote expressed and that the Lord Jesus Christ represented in its fulness in His teachings and in His life. The God of the scriptures, the God who lives, the Almighty, Eternal Father of mankind whom we do not in large measure comprehend because His ways are not our ways, but who has Himself revealed Himself to us in a modern day to reaffirm and reassert the reality of His personal nature—that we are made in His image, that we are in His likeness, that we have in us the rudimentary qualities which He represents in their fulness.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe this is just Mormon talk that you have heard all your lives, to some of you, but I want to tell you that I have been to some places where they don’t have it, and I have seen what they have instead, and I want to share with them—those who are willing to love and understand and worship the God that all the prophets knew and that we have a right to know.</p>
<p>This is a truth that will lift the lives of the finest human beings who do not know it. The truth about the Savior, the truth about man and the nature of man, is so brutally demeaned in historical Christianity, and now in contemporary offshoots. Yet we belong to a Church that teaches that man was in the beginning with God, and that far from imposing upon humankind, “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy” (2 Nephi 2:25) .</p>
<p>It is a Church that teaches us that this body of ours, so much with us, is an eternal component of our soul, that it is a non-evil eternal component of our soul: “And the spirit and the body are the soul of man” (D&amp;C 88:15).</p>
<p>We are committed to a concept of ecclesiastical organization established by Jesus Christ Himself. There is much to be said, and I leave it unsaid; but I tell you it is important, and it is good for men to know, who seek something to give allegiance to and something to serve and share, because men must have this privilege if they are going to enjoy the growth toward godhood that God wants them to have. We believe in the truth about the plan of salvation, the perpetuity of human personality, the long and marvelous march toward spiritual maturity that life ought to involve, with its roadblocks and its side trips and its sad follies.</p>
<p>In these and so many other wonderfully basic important ways we have something to give good people. I want to mention also that in addition to answers to some very important problems, the Church really does have direction and strength to offer good human beings who want to walk with joy in this world.</p>
<p>I want to read a few verses of scripture and ask you to listen with great care from the fifth chapter of the book of Alma. I might have prefaced it with the statement of the Savior, “What manner of men ought ye to be?” (3 Nephi 27:27)—we who profess this great wonderful message. Let me read this:</p>
<p><i>Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? </i>[I skip a few lines to emphasize significant questions. This, the prophet is asking us.]</p>
<p><i>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</i></p>
<p><i>Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</i> [Alma 5:27–31]</p>
<p>There is one other note I want to mention in conclusion about that which is useful to other men. Good men want it. Honest men, when they see it or sense it or feel its presence, often recognize it and comment about it.</p>
<p>Let me read to you a note I received a little time ago, after a war had concluded and a man was seeking to settle something he had felt and questioned:</p>
<p><i>Dear Sirs:</i></p>
<p><i>I am writing this letter in accordance with my will and a desire which was a result of a few hours in an army hospital. There I met a soldier who was a Mormon. I became interested in his religion. Through him I received words that have lived. Since then I have read a Book of Mormon. I would like to receive information as to where I may purchase other books on the Mormon religion so I may find understanding and find wisdom.</i></p>
<p><i>I have a great desire burning within my heart to learn of this religion, even to partake of it. This Mormon soldier, he had something far greater than any other man I ever met. Where is the nearest Mormon Temple to me?</i></p>
<p>I would like to tell you that there are a lot of marvelous people in this world who are just as fine and just as commendable in their integrity and honor as the best of us, but that there is in the Church of Jesus Christ and in the restored gospel that which can lift and strengthen and ennoble and exalt the finest life that does not have it, that will consider and hearken to the revealed word of God. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good afternoon, honored trustees, distinguished guests, family, friends, and, most important, my fellow BYU graduating class of 2017! It is truly an honor to share this day with you all.
Attending BYU has been a privilege and has taught us many practical lessons that will guide us in the coming years. One such lesson is to never give up, which we learned from our daily ascent up the Richards Building stairs or perhaps from watching the City of Provo as it meticulously paves—and repaves—every street in town. Another lesson we have learned is to obey with exactness, which the BYU parking police have so gently taught us over the years. Finally, taking classes in the winding Jesse Knight Building has prepared us to navigate our way through the ambiguous, multi­dimensional parts of our lives.
Above all, our time at BYU has taught us to lift and serve others. I witnessed one such act of service this past September when I flew to Cozumel, Mexico, as a member of Team USA to compete in the ITU Triathlon Age-Group World Championships. While I was there, all three medalists from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games competed for the $30,000 grand prize in the men’s elite category. Two of the triathletes, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, were brothers from Great Britain who had won the gold and silver medals in the triathlon at the 2016 Olympics.
In Cozumel, when the competitors neared the end of the grueling, nearly two-hour race, Jonathan Brownlee held a comfortable lead with his brother, Alistair, trailing him and Henri Schoeman from South Africa close behind. Video footage of the race shows that with 500 meters to go until the finish line, just as the crowd erupted in applause as Jonathan rounded the final corner, the heat began to take its toll upon Jonathan’s body. All of a sudden Jonathan’s pace slowed to a stumble, and he collapsed onto a volunteer standing by the sidelines. There was an audible gasp among the spectators.1
When Alistair rounded the final corner, he saw his dangerously dehydrated younger brother unable to finish the race. Without hesitation Alistair ran toward Jonny, threw his dazed brother’s arm around his neck, and half-carried him as they ran the last 500 meters side by side. Alistair’s deviation cost him a chance at first place, allowing Schoeman to overtake the two and be first to break the tape.
As the brothers approached the finish line, Alistair pushed Jonny across ahead of him, earning them third and second places, respectively.
Alistair was half a kilometer from winning gold as a world champion. Yet rather than race to the end to claim victory for himself, he slowed, picked up his brother, and enabled Jonny to do something he could not do for himself: finish the race.
Reporters swarmed Alistair, incredulous at his noble sacrifice. To their queries he simply replied, “Mum wouldn’t have been happy if I’d left Jonny behind.”2

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You might recall in the beloved Dr. Seuss children’s book Horton Hears a Who! how Horton, who was an elephant, had a chance encounter with a speck of dust, from whence a voice, barely audible, called out for help. Horton recognized that the voice was coming from the speck of dust and proceeded to do all he could to protect and defend this colony of Whos, who were “too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes.”
Horton perceived that someone was in distress and realized that he could help. Instead of discounting his newly discovered friends, and amidst scoffs and scorn from others, he did all he could to give aid. He had a clear understanding of his ability to rescue and protect the Who colony. Through his actions he demonstrated his ability to give aid, share his light, and serve. As Horton exclaimed, “A person’s a person, no matter how small.”
Being Grateful
Having just celebrated Thanksgiving this past week, and as we transition from November into the month of December and celebrate the birth of our beloved Savior, it seems particularly natural that gratitude has taken center stage in our minds and in our hearts—as it should. No matter how humble and meager our circumstances, we each have so much to be grateful for.
President Thomas S. Monson said of gratitude:
To express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven. [“The Divine Gift of Gratitude,” Ensign, November 2010]
He also said:
We can lift ourselves and others as well when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude. [“Divine Gift”]
Gratitude is an expression of our faith. Negativity most certainly breeds despair, depression, lack of enthusiasm, and critical analysis of that which is most likely not our right to criticize or judge.
Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, in a devotional address on gratitude given at BYU, said:
Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make ­others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.
. . . Gratitude is a commandment of the Father. [“Live in Thanksgiving Daily,” BYU devotional address, 31 October 2000]
Doctrine and Covenants 59:7 reads, “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.”
While it may be more challenging to feel grateful when we are in the throes of trials and disappointments, those are the very times when we need to stop, take a look around, and count and list our blessings one by one. It has not been surprising to me throughout my life how</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, brothers and sisters, for taking time from your busy schedules to be here today. From years of personal experience I know the demands and pressures of attending a large university. How grateful I am that you would step away from your studies or other responsibilities to participate in this devotional. Let me also thank those who provided me with this opportunity to speak.
My wife, Tina, and I returned from Jerusalem in mid-August, after a three-year assignment at BYU’s Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. We were blessed to have been in a unique university facility, where we worked closely with administrators, faculty members, staff, volunteer couples, and hundreds of students in a way rarely afforded most people. Let me also thank my lifelong and eternal companion for her constant support in what has been a very intense and very rewarding three years. Her sacrifices were many and her influence on others immense.
Life is often filled with surprises. While I ­recognize the need we all have to set goals and to have lifelong plans in place, we often find ourselves taking detours. Some of these can be scenic and short lived. Others take us down unforeseen paths. I suppose my speaking to you today is one of those shorter detours.
Let me explain: After three years in the Holy Land, my wife and I decided a change of pace was in order when we returned to Utah. Instead of me going back to my office right away, we would spend time with family, find a home, buy a car or two (we sold our home and cars before moving to Jerusalem), and arrange for a trip to Florida to visit Magnolia, our nine-month-old grand­daughter, whom I have never met in person. It was a good plan.
Our first week back could not have gone better. We retreated to my in-laws’ cabin for some welcome family time, they loaned us a car so that we could get around, and our oldest daughter and her husband graciously took us into their home. Life was good!
Then it happened: two weeks after being back, I received an unexpected invitation to speak today—clearly a deviation from the plan, a few ripples on the calm waters of life. In between finding cars (we have), a home (we closed on it last Friday), and spending time with family, I have quietly been slipping into my office on campus to prepare for this wonderful opportunity. I moved the piles of mail that had accumulated during my absence to one side of my desk and set to work, having determined to say something about the Holy Land.
My first exposure to Jerusalem was in 1984, long before most of you were born. Sister Whitchurch and I had spent a couple of years saving money so that we could participate on a three-week Lands of the Scriptures Workshop offered through LDS Seminaries and Institutes. Our travels took us to Italy, Egypt, and many places throughout the Holy Land. From the minute the plane touched down on the tarmac at the Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Avi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a preface to my remarks today, I wish to declare my faith and testimony. I know that there is a God in heaven. He is our Heavenly Father, and He loves all of His children. He has revealed Himself to the world in these the latter days, and prophets walk the earth today as they did anciently.
God loved us, so he sent his Son,
Christ Jesus, the atoning One,
To show us by the path he trod
The one and only way to God.
[“God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son,” Hymns, 2002, no. 187]
I rejoice with you today in this good news and in this truth.
“Lonely in the Midst of a Million”
During the past several years my wife, Carol, and I have been fortunate to live with you here in “Happy Valley.” I consider this a great blessing for us and our family. But I have discovered that even in Happy Valley there are some among us who are not happy and who yearn for recognition and friendship. I find this odd because we live in an environment of relative tranquility and abundance. During an earlier era of peace and plenty described in the Book of Mormon, it was noted: “And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy” (Helaman 6:3). As we fellowship or befriend others, we can also rejoice with them and have great joy.
I have seen this outcome in many of your lives, but not all. There are lonely people among us, and today I share your concern for such souls. Perhaps you are among the lonely. Surely some of those within your reach sense the emptiness of feeling alone in the world. Moroni had such feelings when he wrote, “I am alone . . . , and I have not friends” (Mormon 8:5). But his world was devoid of Saints. In Provo we are surrounded!
In 1867 Mark Twain visited New York City and reported the following: “[New York] is a splendid desert—a domed and steepled solitude, where the stranger is lonely in the midst of a million of his race” (“Letter from ‘Mark Twain,’” San Francisco Daily Alta California, 11 August 1867, 1). How sad that lonely souls walked the same streets as thousands of other lonely persons—their potential friends. This is contrary to the way God would have us live. He desires that we be “no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens” (Ephesians 2:19).
Today there are still lonely people in New York City as well as throughout the world. Listen to a sampling of their voices:
“I always feel lonely and have no friends.”
“I’m not important to anyone. I’m forgettable. I’m boring.”
“I am so lonely. . . . Please just talk to me.” [“I Am Lonely,” experienceproject.com]
Or consider the words of a woman who recently visited a beautiful park. Excited to make new friends that day, she noted:
I passed at least 20 adults, some with children, some with dogs on leashes. The dogs a</span>
