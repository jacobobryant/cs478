  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Good morning! It is indeed a privilege to stand before this assembly and welcome each of you back on campus to begin the 2010 school year. My heart is full of gratitude for the opportunity I have to associate with such an amazing group of young men and women here at Brigham Young University.

Each of you is representative of a generation of young men and women who in the near future will go out into the world and do great and marvelous things—some within the public scrutiny and some more private and personal. You will eventually be found throughout the world because, indeed, the world will be your campus. Without being aware of it, that well-known author Dr. Seuss described you when he wrote:

&lt;i&gt;OH!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;THE PLACES YOU’LL GO!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You’ll be on your way up!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You’ll be seeing great sights!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You’ll join the high fliers&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;who soar to high heights.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;. . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Wherever you fly, you’ll be best of the best.&lt;/i&gt;

And he was right when he said:

&lt;i&gt;You have brains in your head.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You have feet in your shoes.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You can steer yourself&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;any direction you choose.&lt;/i&gt;
[Dr. Seuss, &lt;i&gt;Oh, the Places You’ll Go! &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Random House, 1990), 11–12, 15; 2]

There is a scripture found in Revelation 3:8 that reads: “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.”

The Lord has promised each one of you that He will open doors for you to enter and that He will be a beacon of light for you to follow if you but serve Him. He will make available opportunities and experiences that can help you be successful in both the spiritual and temporal areas of your life. When you seek and listen to the Spirit and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, many blessings will be forthcoming. Prospects for expanding your horizons and for encountering many of life’s experiences are boundless if you enter the doors that the Lord provides for you commensurate with your faith. In fact, He has said that these doors cannot be shut by man, but you can close them yourself if you shut Him out of your life.

At the present time you are students studying to achieve important goals in your lives. You desire to gain an education that will enable you to be successful in future professional and personal endeavors. In the months and years ahead you will be entering doors that will lead you to places and opportunities you may not be able to imagine at the present time. As you make your way on the pathways of life, there will be many of these doors available to you.

There will be times in your future when the door you enter may take you on a road strewn with pain, heartache, and suffering, and you would choose not to take that path if that choice were possible. Individual struggles, however, are necessary for your eternal progression. These trials test your faith, endurance, and submission to the will of the Lord and are part of God’s plan for you.

Also, it is essential that you always recognize and acknowledge the source of all the blessings you receive and that you act accordingly. In 1 Timothy 4:12 you as a youthful generation are admonished to be “an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”

When was the last time you read or recited the thirteen Articles of Faith? All but one of them begins with the words “We believe.” Therefore it certainly would be a good reminder to you of what we as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints profess to believe if you would review the Articles of Faith. You live in a world where economic, political, and social conditions can be extremely dark and depressing without the hope and knowledge of Christ’s mission and message. To this world and its people you are needed to be an example in all you do of the beliefs stated in this body of scripture.

Those who observe your lifestyle and behavior learn a great deal about your character, faith, and values. They can be inspired by your example if you follow the teachings of our Savior Jesus Christ. It is possible, however, for the opposite to occur if your words and actions are not consistent with the principles and teachings of the gospel.

President David O. McKay was the president of the Church during my high school and college years. Just as Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson will be the leaders you will recall as influencing you during those same tender years in your lives, President McKay is the one I admired, loved, and strived to heed the counsel of.

When I periodically enter the Missionary Training Center in Provo, I am reminded of him when I view the replica of a stone that is on display in the main entrance. The inscription on the stone influenced President McKay throughout his whole life. The message came at a time when President McKay was very discouraged and downhearted while serving his first mission in Scotland. He had just received a rebuke from a Scottish woman to whom he had presented a tract. The prejudice and misconceptions he felt the people had toward him and the Church hurt him very deeply. As he departed from the Scottish town of Stirling after touring its historic castle on that same day, he had the following life-altering experience:

&lt;i&gt;As we were coming back into town, I saw on my right an unfinished dwelling, over the front door of which there was some carving. That was most unusual, so I said to Elder Johnston, “I’m going to see what that is.” I was halfway up the graveled walk when there came to my eyesight a striking motto, carved in stone: “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I repeated it to Elder Johnston as we walked into town to find a place for our lodgings before we began our work. We walked quietly, but I said to myself, or the Spirit within me whispered, “You are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. More than that, you are a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. You accepted the responsibility as a representative of the Church.” . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . I accepted the message given to me on that stone, and from that moment we tried to do our part as missionaries in Scotland. &lt;/i&gt;[David O. McKay, &lt;i&gt;“My Young Friends . . .” President McKay Speaks to Youth,&lt;/i&gt; comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973), 39; see also “Pres. McKay Speaks to Pioneer Stake Youth,” &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 21 September 1957, 4]

President McKay spoke often of this experience and of how powerful and influential the message on the stone was to him and how it became an important guideline throughout his life. In fact, in his biography of President McKay, Francis Gibbons stated:

&lt;i&gt;There can be no doubt that this experience, which planted the motto in his mind under such unusual circumstances, was one of the major factors in the growth and development of David O. McKay.&lt;/i&gt; [Francis M. Gibbons, &lt;i&gt;David O. McKay: Apostle to the World, Prophet of God&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986), 46]

President David O. McKay, of course, also reiterated that the message applied to “moral and lawful endeavors, and not to harmful or villainous actions” (McKay, &lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; October 1954, 83; also McKay, “Whate’er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part,” &lt;i&gt;Improvement Era,&lt;/i&gt; October 1959, 726; reprinted in McKay, &lt;i&gt;What E’er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part: The Missionary Diaries of David O. McKay&lt;/i&gt;, eds. Stan Larson and Patricia Larson [Salt Lake City: Blue Ribbon Books, 1999], 274). Today it remains a reminder to us of the scripture found in Mosiah 18:9 in which we are admonished “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”

As my husband and I were raising our family, we jokingly—but very seriously—would say to our children periodically as they left the house for various reasons, “Remember who you are and what you represent.” We were reminding each that they were a son or daughter of Heavenly Father and that their behavior in every word and action was representative of their family, church, and God.

At present you have different roles in your lives. These roles often change from day to day or even from hour to hour. As mentioned previously, each of you is a student at Brigham Young University who is striving to be successful in every aspect of that role. Hopefully you will periodically recall the motto of President McKay and remember to “act well thy part” in your day-to-day activities.

You can be found learning in the classrooms, studying in the library or cafeterias, walking on campus, working at jobs on or off campus, attending sporting events in different venues on this campus or away, driving motorized vehicles, socializing with friends and classmates, or attending your church meetings. I could, of course, continue with a more extensive list. As a student here we hope you understand and are an example of the motto “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.”

The Lord has opened a door for you to attend BYU with its attendant blessings, challenges, expectations, and experiences. At the doorway to this campus you are reminded to “Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve.” He would have each of you remember who you are and how much He loves you as one of His spiritual sons or daughters. He would have you serve your fellow men—benefiting them and making this world better for your having lived in it.

You will continue to take on new roles as you leave campus life. You will find yourselves having different roles in your families. You will serve in many different capacities and assignments in the Church. You will be leaders as well as followers. In the workplace and at home you will create, teach, learn, serve, and so forth. You will have vitally important roles in your community, family, and church. Throughout your life you will have opportunities each day to be reminded of the admonition that was followed by a prophet of the Lord: “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.”

I have a testimony that the Lord lives and that we will be blessed as we enter the righteous doors He will provide if we but serve Him. I am thankful for a prophet—President Thomas S. Monson—to guide, teach, and counsel us. May we all be examples of the believers and act well our part is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Good morning! It is indeed a privilege to stand before this assembly and welcome each of you back on campus to begin the 2010 school year. My heart is full of gratitude for the opportunity I have to associate with such an amazing group of young men and women here at Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>Each of you is representative of a generation of young men and women who in the near future will go out into the world and do great and marvelous things—some within the public scrutiny and some more private and personal. You will eventually be found throughout the world because, indeed, the world will be your campus. Without being aware of it, that well-known author Dr. Seuss described you when he wrote:</p>
<p><i>OH!</i></p>
<p><i>THE PLACES YOU’LL GO!</i></p>
<p><i>You’ll be on your way up!</i><br />
<i>You’ll be seeing great sights!</i><br />
<i>You’ll join the high fliers</i><br />
<i>who soar to high heights.</i><br />
<i>. . .</i><br />
<i>Wherever you fly, you’ll be best of the best.</i></p>
<p>And he was right when he said:</p>
<p><i>You have brains in your head.</i><br />
<i>You have feet in your shoes.</i><br />
<i>You can steer yourself</i><br />
<i>any direction you choose.</i><br />
[Dr. Seuss, <i>Oh, the Places You’ll Go! </i>(New York: Random House, 1990), 11–12, 15; 2]</p>
<p>There is a scripture found in Revelation 3:8 that reads: “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.”</p>
<p>The Lord has promised each one of you that He will open doors for you to enter and that He will be a beacon of light for you to follow if you but serve Him. He will make available opportunities and experiences that can help you be successful in both the spiritual and temporal areas of your life. When you seek and listen to the Spirit and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, many blessings will be forthcoming. Prospects for expanding your horizons and for encountering many of life’s experiences are boundless if you enter the doors that the Lord provides for you commensurate with your faith. In fact, He has said that these doors cannot be shut by man, but you can close them yourself if you shut Him out of your life.</p>
<p>At the present time you are students studying to achieve important goals in your lives. You desire to gain an education that will enable you to be successful in future professional and personal endeavors. In the months and years ahead you will be entering doors that will lead you to places and opportunities you may not be able to imagine at the present time. As you make your way on the pathways of life, there will be many of these doors available to you.</p>
<p>There will be times in your future when the door you enter may take you on a road strewn with pain, heartache, and suffering, and you would choose not to take that path if that choice were possible. Individual struggles, however, are necessary for your eternal progression. These trials test your faith, endurance, and submission to the will of the Lord and are part of God’s plan for you.</p>
<p>Also, it is essential that you always recognize and acknowledge the source of all the blessings you receive and that you act accordingly. In 1 Timothy 4:12 you as a youthful generation are admonished to be “an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”</p>
<p>When was the last time you read or recited the thirteen Articles of Faith? All but one of them begins with the words “We believe.” Therefore it certainly would be a good reminder to you of what we as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints profess to believe if you would review the Articles of Faith. You live in a world where economic, political, and social conditions can be extremely dark and depressing without the hope and knowledge of Christ’s mission and message. To this world and its people you are needed to be an example in all you do of the beliefs stated in this body of scripture.</p>
<p>Those who observe your lifestyle and behavior learn a great deal about your character, faith, and values. They can be inspired by your example if you follow the teachings of our Savior Jesus Christ. It is possible, however, for the opposite to occur if your words and actions are not consistent with the principles and teachings of the gospel.</p>
<p>President David O. McKay was the president of the Church during my high school and college years. Just as Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson will be the leaders you will recall as influencing you during those same tender years in your lives, President McKay is the one I admired, loved, and strived to heed the counsel of.</p>
<p>When I periodically enter the Missionary Training Center in Provo, I am reminded of him when I view the replica of a stone that is on display in the main entrance. The inscription on the stone influenced President McKay throughout his whole life. The message came at a time when President McKay was very discouraged and downhearted while serving his first mission in Scotland. He had just received a rebuke from a Scottish woman to whom he had presented a tract. The prejudice and misconceptions he felt the people had toward him and the Church hurt him very deeply. As he departed from the Scottish town of Stirling after touring its historic castle on that same day, he had the following life-altering experience:</p>
<p><i>As we were coming back into town, I saw on my right an unfinished dwelling, over the front door of which there was some carving. That was most unusual, so I said to Elder Johnston, “I’m going to see what that is.” I was halfway up the graveled walk when there came to my eyesight a striking motto, carved in stone: “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.”</i> <i>I repeated it to Elder Johnston as we walked into town to find a place for our lodgings before we began our work. We walked quietly, but I said to myself, or the Spirit within me whispered, “You are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. More than that, you are a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. You accepted the responsibility as a representative of the Church.” . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . I accepted the message given to me on that stone, and from that moment we tried to do our part as missionaries in Scotland. </i>[David O. McKay, <i>“My Young Friends . . .” President McKay Speaks to Youth,</i> comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973), 39; see also “Pres. McKay Speaks to Pioneer Stake Youth,” <i>Church News,</i> 21 September 1957, 4]</p>
<p>President McKay spoke often of this experience and of how powerful and influential the message on the stone was to him and how it became an important guideline throughout his life. In fact, in his biography of President McKay, Francis Gibbons stated:</p>
<p><i>There can be no doubt that this experience, which planted the motto in his mind under such unusual circumstances, was one of the major factors in the growth and development of David O. McKay.</i> [Francis M. Gibbons, <i>David O. McKay: Apostle to the World, Prophet of God</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986), 46]</p>
<p>President David O. McKay, of course, also reiterated that the message applied to “moral and lawful endeavors, and not to harmful or villainous actions” (McKay, <i>CR,</i> October 1954, 83; also McKay, “Whate’er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part,” <i>Improvement Era,</i> October 1959, 726; reprinted in McKay, <i>What E’er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part: The Missionary Diaries of David O. McKay</i>, eds. Stan Larson and Patricia Larson [Salt Lake City: Blue Ribbon Books, 1999], 274). Today it remains a reminder to us of the scripture found in Mosiah 18:9 in which we are admonished “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”</p>
<p>As my husband and I were raising our family, we jokingly—but very seriously—would say to our children periodically as they left the house for various reasons, “Remember who you are and what you represent.” We were reminding each that they were a son or daughter of Heavenly Father and that their behavior in every word and action was representative of their family, church, and God.</p>
<p>At present you have different roles in your lives. These roles often change from day to day or even from hour to hour. As mentioned previously, each of you is a student at Brigham Young University who is striving to be successful in every aspect of that role. Hopefully you will periodically recall the motto of President McKay and remember to “act well thy part” in your day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>You can be found learning in the classrooms, studying in the library or cafeterias, walking on campus, working at jobs on or off campus, attending sporting events in different venues on this campus or away, driving motorized vehicles, socializing with friends and classmates, or attending your church meetings. I could, of course, continue with a more extensive list. As a student here we hope you understand and are an example of the motto “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.”</p>
<p>The Lord has opened a door for you to attend BYU with its attendant blessings, challenges, expectations, and experiences. At the doorway to this campus you are reminded to “Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve.” He would have each of you remember who you are and how much He loves you as one of His spiritual sons or daughters. He would have you serve your fellow men—benefiting them and making this world better for your having lived in it.</p>
<p>You will continue to take on new roles as you leave campus life. You will find yourselves having different roles in your families. You will serve in many different capacities and assignments in the Church. You will be leaders as well as followers. In the workplace and at home you will create, teach, learn, serve, and so forth. You will have vitally important roles in your community, family, and church. Throughout your life you will have opportunities each day to be reminded of the admonition that was followed by a prophet of the Lord: “Whate’er thou art, act well thy part.”</p>
<p>I have a testimony that the Lord lives and that we will be blessed as we enter the righteous doors He will provide if we but serve Him. I am thankful for a prophet—President Thomas S. Monson—to guide, teach, and counsel us. May we all be examples of the believers and act well our part is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My beloved brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you today. I love this university for many reasons—not the least of these is the fact that I attended school here, as did my wife, our five children, and four of five of their spouses. I suppose you could say that I have a personal, financial investment in this university.
I love that so many wonderful, intelligent disciples of the Savior come to this campus to dedicate themselves to the pursuit of truth and to seek temporal and spiritual knowledge.
I have already said that I love this university. What I didn’t tell you was that I also carry fond feelings for this building in which we are seated today.
As I was watching students enter the building this morning, it brought back a flood of memories. For a moment it seemed as though time had rolled back, and I could see myself as a student your age, entering this very building.
However, in my case, the reason I most often entered this building was to work the midnight cleanup shift here at the Marriott Activities Center. If you look around, you will see the very places I walked with broom and mop, tidying up after devotionals, basketball games, and special events. So for those of you who might be tempted to litter while you are here, please keep in mind that I will be watching.
This campus is sacred. While I worked and studied here, I also pondered questions that many of you might be asking at this time of your life:
• What should I study?
• What will become of me?
• Does the Lord care which career I choose?
• Will I ever meet someone, fall in love, and get married?
• Will I find happiness and success in life?
I have to tell you that these questions felt all consuming and even frightening at times. I honestly didn’t know exactly where my life would go when I was your age. One thing is certain: I never imagined as I was sweeping this great hall that one day I would be at this pulpit speaking to you.
Today I want to address two of the questions you might be asking—things I myself desperately wanted to know when I was your age.
First, if you dedicate your life to God’s ­service, will He direct your steps and use you for His righteous purposes?
Second, if you choose to follow the Savior and walk in the path of discipleship, will the Lord watch over you, guide you, bless you, and fill you with a spirit of joy and fulfillment?
A Temple in Philadelphia
In the ten years prior to my being called to the Presiding Bishopric, I had the blessing and privilege of helping to identify and acquire sites for temples.
A few years ago President Thomas S. Monson announced that there would be a ­temple in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, so we went to work researching possible sites where that temple could be built. Two sites ultimately emerged—and it just so happened that they were across the street from each o</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to each of the graduates today. Graduation is properly a time of celebration—a time to rejoice in the success you have all achieved in earning your degree. It is also properly a time to look forward to what lies ahead—that is in part why we call this ­ceremony a commencement.
Many of you will go immediately into your first post-college full-time job. Others will head to graduate school. Some will dedicate themselves to the full-time pursuit of raising children. Each of these new adventures will likely be challenging, stimulating, and, in a few cases, close to all consuming—in ways that may cause you to lose perspective.
As you begin this next phase of your life, especially the majority of you who will eventually spend most of your waking hours in a career outside the home, I ask you to reflect on the words of Os Guinness, who astutely observed that, in today’s society,
work takes up so many of our waking hours that our jobs come to define us and give us our ­identities. We become what we do.1
The world would often teach us that we are what we do. It does not take long in most social gatherings to realize this. One of the first questions that is asked when meeting a new person in a professional setting is “What do you do?” The answer to that question not only determines the subject and length of the ensuing conversation but also often creates the identity of the respondent from that point on.
Guinness urges us to not fall into the trap of defining ourselves by our jobs but instead to view our jobs—indeed, our entire lives—as a calling and to choose our jobs and how we fulfill them by determining who we are. In his words:
Calling reverses [the world’s] thinking. . . . Instead of, “You are what you do,” calling says: “Do what you are.”2
I urge you to consider this concept as you move ahead with your lives, because who you are is extraordinary—“beloved . . . son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents” with “a divine nature and destiny.”3 And as a result of who you are—and who you can become—you can have a profound impact on those around you, not only in your jobs but also in your communities and, most important, in your homes.
Because you have lived in the unique environment that is Brigham Young University for the past few years, you may overlook the depth of the impact that those who become what the university and the gospel urge them to become can have on others on this campus.
In 2005, Naomi Schaeffer Riley wrote a book about religiously affiliated universities in the United States. The book is entitled God on the Quad. Riley began her book describing a speech given by author Tom Wolfe at a Class Day address at Harvard in which Wolfe described our current time frame as “the era of the ‘fifth</span>

My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One privilege that is mine as alumni president is to officially welcome you into our BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer upon each of you a lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 410,000 living alumni. You will have many opportunities over the years to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with this university.
The mission of BYU “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”1 This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn’t end, your quest doesn’t end, and our relationship doesn’t end. Our mission as alumni is to extend this marvelous BYU experience beyond graduation and build lifelong relationships with our alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you have learned here. We hope that you will treasure these great lessons and stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Through our alumni campaign—we call it RISE—we have begun collecting the stories of more than 6,700 of our former students. Here is just one of them.
Arizona graduate Duane Oakes initially struggled to find his place at BYU. With only a few friends and no family nearby, he was contemplating returning home when he met a student-government advisor who told him he wasn’t going anywhere because she was going to mentor him. As he was helped, he discovered that he had a passion for helping other students and became involved. Through an educational career he has devoted himself to keeping the legacy going of the things he learned at BYU. He stayed involved.
Now Duane serves on the faculty of Mesa Community College and directs the Center for Community and Civic Engagement. He and his wife now lead the Arizona BYU Alumni Chapter in Phoenix. We love his story. We would love to hear your stories, and we invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
You are now entering another phase of your eternal progression. We hope your experiences at the Y have opened your eyes to future possibilities. Understand that none of us has “arrived.” We are all in a process of “becoming.” As you know, that process is fraught with trials and tests. But fundamental to this process is our belief in the fact that we can become what our Heavenly Father wants us to be.
Let me share a favorite story: Hope for the Flowers by Trina Paulus. This is a story of how two cater­pillars traversed the trials and risks in their lives to become beautiful butterflies. It started with discovering what a butterf</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, Elder Oaks, for your very important address. My wife, Wendy, had planned to be with us today. Unfortunately, she sprained her ankle and is propped up at home watching these proceedings on TV. She was on the faculty here for thirteen years. We love BYU. She joins me in extending our heartfelt congratulations to all graduates and their families. We are especially grateful for the excellent messages given by three of the leading lights of this dispensation: President Kevin J Worthen, Dr. Donald B. Doty, and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.
President Worthen stands tall in his position as the thirteenth president of the university. He excelled in his chosen field of law and once served as dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and as advancement vice president at BYU. In the Church he serves as an Area Seventy. We trust him. His peers look up to him. His students emulate him.
Dr. Donald B. Doty is regarded across the globe as the premiere teacher of cardiac surgery. His textbooks are used by specialists throughout the world. You will want to read every word of his amazing biographical summary in your commencement program. While excelling in his profession, he has served in the Church as bishop, stake president, regional representative, and Area Seventy. Later we called upon him to direct the medical affairs of the Missionary Department, which he did as a volunteer for nine years. We are most grateful for his and Cheryl’s building a network of help for our missionaries that will endure for years. We love them and salute them today, particularly Brother Doty as he gets his honorary degree. No one could be more deserving.
Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were called to the Quorum of the Twelve in April 1984. It has been my rare privilege to sit beside him in our quorum meetings for more than thirty-one years. You know of Elder Oaks’ past service as the eighth president of BYU and as a justice of the supreme court of the state of Utah. Today you heard him talk about your need to take heart. He also asked you to consider what God wants you to be: to be joyful, to be creative, and to develop a love of God that will bring you a fulness of joy.
Now, let me share a thought for you graduates. You are entering a new phase of life. To this point you have been striving to meet expectations imposed upon you by other people. You have passed exams and may have to pass others in order to become certified. You have been jumping over high hurdles established by others. In order to prepare for what you want to do in life, this is good. But with this transition in the pursuit of your formal education, you need to continue to focus on becoming the person the Lord needs you to be. Strive to develop the spiritual attributes of faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence.
These attributes are difficult to measure, but they constitute the substance of what the Lord hopes fo</span>
