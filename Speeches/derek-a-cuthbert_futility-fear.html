  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear young friends, I would like to share with you today some thoughts on the futility of fear.

Anciently the Lord spoke to Isaac, saying, "Fear not, for I am with thee" (Genesis 26:24). The admonition to "fear not" was clear and direct and meaningful. The promise that "I am with thee" was equally plain and direct and powerful.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freedom from Fear Is Essential&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Down through the ages the same admonition, the same assurance, has been extended to every living soul who is willing to qualify. And yet fear is prevalent throughout the earth. It stifles initiative, saps strength, and reduces efficiency. It weakens faith, brings doubts, and begets mistrust. Indeed, it tends to impede the very business of being. How negative, frustrating, and futile is fear.

Let us consider together then the futility of fear, so that we may overcome it and exclude it from our lives as much as possible. Then shall our efforts yield their full potential, and out minds will be unshackled and enlightened with eternal truth. Indeed, one of the four essential human freedoms listed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a message to Congress, is "Freedom from Fear" (January 6, 1941).

As we embark together on this brief voyage of discovery, I trust that we will grasp the helm of faith to guide us through some troubled waters. Emily Brontes immortal words are apt.

&lt;i&gt;No coward soul is mine,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No trembler in the worlds storm-troubled sphere:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I see Heavens glories shine,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Last Lines,&lt;/i&gt; 1846]

How shall we then arm ourselves from fear?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ten Aspects of Fear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Just like people, fear comes in all shapes and sizes. There are those who fear people; others fear things. Many fear the future, and some fear the past. Where do you fit in? I will present ten aspects of the futility of fear, and I trust that this sharing will be beneficial, uplifting, and arming.

&lt;b&gt;First,&lt;/b&gt; there is fear of God. Among all of the possible fears, this is the only one that is valid. However, it is not fear in the normal sense of lack of courage, but rather love, respect, and reverence. Indeed, fear of God in this sense can dispel all other fears. Two examples are the assurance and admonition to the Israelites, "the Lord is with us: fear them not" (Numbers 14:9), and Apostle Pauls rhetorical question, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31), meaning "who can prevail against us?" (JST Romans 8:31).

Fear, or love, of God also brings many other blessings besides courage. "It shall be well with them that fear God" (Ecclesiastes 8:12), for he is "gracious unto those who fear" him (D&amp;amp;C 76:5). Yes, fear, or love, of God releases us, frees us, just as acceptance of truth does, for "the truth shall make [us] free" (John 8:32).

&lt;b&gt;Second&lt;/b&gt;, there is fear of man. There are those who fear physical domination by others. The Psalmist gave good counsel that we should "not fear what flesh can do unto [us]" (Psalms 56:4). Solomon also gave the wise saying that "fear of man bringeth a snare" (Proverbs 29:25). It is hard for a child to realize this when someone sets upon him. Experience teaches that it is futile to be afraid, for fear attracts the attention of the bully and the derision of those who mock.

The Lord, through Moses, declared with firmness to the Israelites:

&lt;i&gt;When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &lt;/i&gt;[Deuteronomy 20:1]

To return good for evil not only overcomes fear, but also overcomes enmity. I remember when we had an unfriendly neighbor some years ago. He would play the radio very loudly and generally try to be objectionable - so much as to generate fear. I am glad I was prompted to retain a positive, cheerful demeanor which overcame fear and eventually broke down the barrier, for "perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).

&lt;b&gt;Third,&lt;/b&gt; much more prevalent than physical fear, is the fear of criticism, rejection, and verbal opposition. Again, the scriptures are replete with counsel and admonition. In latter-day revelation to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, the Lord said, in relation to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript of the Book of Mormon, "You should not have feared man more than God" (D&amp;amp;C 3:7).

Saul was rejected as king because, as he confessed to Samuel, "I feared the people, and obeyed their voice" (1 Samuel 15:24). Will you transgress the commandments of the Lord because you fear what others will say if you dont follow them in the ways of the world? "Fear ye not the reproach of men," the Lord counseled through Isaiah (Isaiah 51:7). In more recent times he has chided those who "will not open their mouths [to share the gospel] . . . because of the fear of man" (D&amp;amp;C 60:2).

When we have something to tell others which will benefit them, protect them, or enlighten them, we should not hold back. There are so many people who are confused and discouraged, and who want a better way of life. How grateful they are when someone takes the time to share their happiness and purpose in life. Will you seek to share even more? You are a great power for good, providing your righteous potential is harnessed by service.

While I served as mission president in Scotland from 1975 to 1978, the Church received considerable opposition and criticism. On one occasion, three ministers made derogatory public statements in a particular city. I wrote an open letter to the local newspaper announcing that we would be holding a public meeting in that city to dispel some of the misunderstandings which were being voiced around. It was a wonderful meeting. We first showed the fine Church film "Meet the Mormons," and then I spoke to the large group concerning our beliefs and way of life. When we opened the meeting for questions, a number of people who were not members of the Church stood and said kind things about the Church and the Latter-day Saints they knew. Positive results ensued and the work moved forward.

What if we had feared the criticism? I remember receiving a telephone call from a missionary who was obviously a little fearful. He said, "President, what shall we do? We have a man from the local church who follows us wherever we go and tries to stop us from knocking on the doors."

The young missionary was surprised at my response. "Good," I said. "You will have much success there, for the adversary is getting worried." I told him of the experience of the early missionaries to the British Isles, just before the first baptisms took place in Preston. Elder Heber C. Kimball, grandfather of our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball, recorded it as follows:

&lt;i&gt;By this time the adversary of souls began to rage, and he felt determined to destroy us before we had fully established the kingdom of God in that land, and the next morning I witnessed a scene of satanic power and influence which I shall never forget. &lt;/i&gt;[Orson F. Whitney, &lt;i&gt;Life of Heber C. Kimball &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1888), p. 143]

After my wife and I were baptized in January 1951, many of our neighbors shunned us, sometimes crossing the street so they would not meet us face-to-face. This did not affect our attitude, however, and we would greet them normally. It was not long before they would come to us and say, "We have a child who is ill, would you pray for her?" or "I have a problem. Would you please give me some counsel and advice?"

There is never any need to fear opposition, criticism, or persecution, for we know what will be the outcome. The Lords work goes forward even more strongly, for

&lt;i&gt;the works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 3:1, 3]

&lt;b&gt;Fourth,&lt;/b&gt; there are some who fear events, such as examinations and tests, interviews and journeys. These are all challenges which we need to shoulder. Fear usually brings failure. The Savior warned of "mens hearts failing them for fear" (Luke 21:26). Eleanor Roosevelt said, "You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face" (&lt;i&gt;You Learn by Living&lt;/i&gt;, 1960).

There is an excellent example of this when Elishas servant discovered that the Syrian army had surrounded the city of Dothan, wherein they dwelt. Fearfully, he said to the prophet, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?"

Elisha answered him firmly: "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:1516). Well could he say this, for "Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6:17).

One lesson we have to learn is that fear is the beginning of defeat. On the other hand, courage is the beginning of success. We gain courage by the realization that we have a lot going for us. We derive strength from the knowledge that the Lord is with us. To Abraham he declared, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield" (Genesis 15:1). This is exactly what we need in this tempting, permissive world - a shield to protect us from the "fiery darts of the wicked" (D&amp;amp;C 27:17).

One great event that some people fear is referred to as "the end of the world." We know that at the second coming of Jesus Christ it will be the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Malachi 4:5, D&amp;amp;C 110:14) - dread being a synonym for fear. We can make it a great day for us, though, rather than a dreadful day. How? By qualifying, by complying, by following the Lord. It is futile to be afraid when we could be "looking forth for the great day of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 45:39).

As a young boy, not quite thirteen years of age, in September 1939, it was natural to have some momentary fear when I heard that war had been declared. Some of the children even speculated about the end of the world coming in those dark days that followed, when the invasion of England seemed imminent, and bombs were falling all around. We were not really afraid, however, for we had faith in God. We prayed and worked for deliverance, and miraculously it came.

Another futile fear that I dispelled some years later was the fear of heights. We were building our new chapel in Nottingham, England, with all the members helping. My specialty was laying floor tile and placing acoustic ceiling tile, mainly in the corridors and classrooms. There was a call for someone to fix some ceiling tiles at the very apex of the chapel ceiling. I dont know the height, but as I started to climb the ladder, it seemed like scaling Mount Everest. On reaching the top I had to measure exactly, then descend the ladder, cut the tiles to shape and size, climb once again and fit them in place. Certainly, the best way to overcome fear of heights is to "do it," as President Kimball has challenged. In fact, he has said, "Give me another mountain."

&lt;b&gt;Fifth,&lt;/b&gt; another event which strikes fear and apprehension into the hearts of many, is death. The prophet Mormon speaks of "that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked" (Mormon 6:7). This particular fear arises from misunderstanding of the purpose of life and lack of knowledge of the plan of our Eternal Father. It is vital to come to an understanding that death is not the end, but a new beginning, a necessary stage in our eternal progression. Fear of death accomplishes nothing if we are righteous, for "death is swallowed up in victory. . . . victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:54, 57).

David, the shepherd/psalmist, gave us those magnificent words of comfort:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.&lt;/i&gt; [Psalms 23:4]

Speaking of death in this way gives the Lords perspective, whereas talking fearfully of death creates fear and uneasiness.

Some years ago, a dear young friend of ours, Pat, was stricken with cancer. She was not afraid of death, but was concerned about her small children. She did not want to leave them while they were so young. Her great faith and courage were rewarded and she was granted a few vital years to care for her family before she peacefully passed away.

I think of another very dear friend, Joan, our closest friend in the Church, who was tragically killed by a car as she crossed a pedestrian walkway in Salt Lake City. She certainly did not fear death, for she was fully prepared. Everything was in order, in her personal life and in her personal papers. She was ready to meet the Lord.

&lt;b&gt;Sixth,&lt;/b&gt; we will consider other fears of the unknown. These may be experienced in a number of ways: fear of the dark, fear of change, fear of the future. Such fear can be overcome by faith, as the Lord showed as he rebuked the winds and the sea. "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" he challenged his disciples (Matthew 8:26).

The Lords disciples succumbed to this type of fear on several occasions. When they saw Jesus walking on the water, he comforted them, saying, "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid" (Matthew 14:27). Again, when he appeared to them after his resurrection, they were "terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit." He developed faith within them as he asked them to "handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke 24:37, 39).

Reassurance from others is an important step toward faith. For example, there is the comfort given by parents to children afraid of the dark, or by a wife to a husband about to change his place of work. I remember during my Royal Air Force service in India and Burma, during World War II, one of our colleagues was always imagining a twisted stick to be a snake. We had to reassure him on numerous occasions to allay his fears. As Theseus remarked in Shakespeares &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer-Nights Dream&lt;/i&gt;: "Or in the night, imagining some fear, / How easy is a bush supposd a bear!" (act 5, scene 1).

Again, concerning the future, is it unknown? The Lord has told us much about the future through his prophets. "Fear not," he has counseled, "let your hearts be comforted" (D&amp;amp;C 98:1). "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30).

The pattern of the scriptures is first a commandment, then a promise. Providing we live our lives in harmony with the commandments of God, there is no place for fear regarding the consequences. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I have a strong testimony of this - for while we have not sought for worldly possessions, we have always had sufficient for our needs since we put our hands to the gospel plough.

&lt;b&gt;Seventh,&lt;/b&gt; we have fear of responsibility. I remember just after I joined the Church, a great feeling of confidence came over me. I felt that since I had chosen the Lords side, he was on my side. Several remarkable things happened, of which I will recount but two.

Although I had never had the courage to stand on my feet and speak in debate, either at high school or college, I found myself asking my branch president if I might give a talk in sacrament meeting. I still have the notes of that very first talk. It was on faith and works.

A few months after my baptism, a golden opportunity presented itself at my place of work, where I was a management trainee. Again I had that strong feeling of self-assurance, and I received my first promotion, which set my feet on the management ladder. I found that through my Church membership and the faith it engendered, I overcame the fear of taking responsibility.

I have always loved reading the Apostle Pauls epistles to Timothy and particularly cherish this advice: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7). I have learned to rely on the Comforter, even the Holy Ghost, to give me the feeling of peace and confidence, and to bring things to my remembrance.

Said the Savior: "Whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 10:55). How true that is, for in his Church the gift of the Holy Ghost is available to all. We can have the promptings of impending danger, as I have had on several occasions. We can have the discerning of places we should not go and things we should not do. It is futile to fear when the Holy Ghost is with you and the Lord himself is "on your right hand and on your left" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88).

What of marriage responsibility? Are there some who delay marriage for fear of the responsibility? When my wife and I were married, we had the magnificent sum of twenty English pounds between us. Although young, we felt ready for the challenges and responsibilities that we knew lay ahead. What a glorious experience it has been for almost forty years now to shoulder responsibility and struggle together in building a happy home and a wonderful family of ten precious children.

From time to time I meet members of the Church who do not feel able to take responsibility as an officer or a teacher in the Church. I tell them of my experience in England. Literally within days of baptism I was called to head the youth program in the Nottingham branch. This was completely new to me and I felt inadequate, but I knew the Lord needed me. There were less than 7,000 members in the whole of the British Isles where there are now 40 stakes. We all had to be "anxiously engaged" in the work of saving souls, building the kingdom, and establishing Zion. So it is with all of us. It is futile to fear responsibility when we have been called to serve "by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority" (Articles of Faith 1:5).

&lt;b&gt;Eighth&lt;/b&gt; is fear of loneliness. Linked with this is the fear of being in a small minority. This type of fear often results in compromise of principles and giving in to the demands of others for fear of being lonely, or being the odd one out. In latter-day revelation, the Lord has given comfort and assurance to those in this situation.

&lt;i&gt;Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 6:34]

Fear of loneliness includes fear of not having anyone to talk to, or being without help in time of need. These fears can be conquered by reaching out and giving service to others, becoming outward-looking instead of inward-looking. In order to have a friend, we must be a friend.

I think of dear Sister Amy Gent, who I was privileged to visit for fifteen years as a branch president, home teacher, and friend. The first time I visited her, she was eighty-seven years of age, and I was later honored to speak at the funeral of this wonderful lady who stepped from this life at age one hundred and two. Widowed twice, she was the only member of the Church in her extended family. Was she lonely? Never!

She read the scriptures every day and once asked me to take her some missionary tracts, which I thought were to vary her reading. I gave them to her, saying, "You will enjoy reading these, Sister Gent."

"Oh, they are not for me," she replied. "I visit an old lady and I want to share the gospel with her!"

Reaching out, helping, serving - this is the way we overcome the fear of loneliness.

A few weeks ago, a brother complained to me, "When I was away on business recently, in another part of the country, I went to church and no one spoke to me. I felt very lonely, especially as I was so far from home."

I paused and then asked, "How many people did you speak to?" At first he was a little annoyed, feeling I had not empathized, but then he smiled and said, "Youre right, I did hold back instead of reaching out."

&lt;b&gt;Ninth,&lt;/b&gt; fear of the past haunts those who have transgressed and have not yet gained forgiveness and remission. It holds them back, but this should be but a temporary phase. As President Kimball has counseled:

&lt;i&gt;To cure spiritual diseases which throttle us and plague our lives, the Lord has given us a sure cure - repentance.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;The Miracle of Forgiveness &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), preface]

Furthermore, the Lord has given us a wonderful formula to enable us to remove fear and guilt:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins - behold, he will confess them and forsake them.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 58:4243]

Once we confess, we need have no more fear about being found out. What a tremendous burden is lifted, which otherwise would weigh us down interminably. Confession is the first major step in the process of repentance. Sincere repentance is many-faceted; it is more than confession. There must needs be a forsaking and turning away from transgression in all its sordid forms.

Then we can look forward to and, indeed, claim fulfillment of the promise of the Lord, that he will not only forgive, but remember our sins no more. What a contrast to the lot of those of whom Isaiah speaks:

&lt;i&gt;Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? And who knoweth us?&lt;/i&gt; [Isaiah 29:15]

On a number of occasions I have had the happy assignment to meet with those who have prepared to come back into the fullness of gospel blessings. What a great day it is for them. Fear of the past has fled and they are starting out anew. It is good to be able to say to them, "Today is the first day of the rest of your lives."

We need to spring-clean our lives, sweep out each nook and cranny and under the carpet. In the world of industry and commerce, which used to be my environment, regular inventory is taken. At these times, decisions are made to eliminate certain items from the inventory and to mark other items down in value.

We should take inventory in our lives, as did Scrooge, and cast out the dross so that we become unencumbered and free from fear of the past.

When recommendations are being considered for appointment to public office, investigation of the personal life and affairs of the nominee is becoming more frequent. Whether we have aspirations for success in the political, business, academic, or other spheres of activity, we should endeavor to keep ourselves "unspotted from the world" (James 1:27). In order not to fear the past, try not to do anything in the present that you will regret in the future.

&lt;b&gt;Tenth&lt;/b&gt;, and finally, there is fear of failure. There are those who will not even attempt to do something because they lack the self-assurance that they could accomplish it. I was raised with the old adage ringing in my ears, "If at first you dont succeed, try, try again." There is no disgrace in failure, and in any case, we have never failed until we give up. The four-minute mile eluded athletes for many years, but after trying again and again, Dr. Roger Bannister finally achieved it. Since then, athletes from many lands have broken this seeming barrier.

President N. Eldon Tanner remarked on one occasion, "One of the evils of the world today is not failure, but low aim." Just as we should not fear to fail, neither should we fear to aim high. There was no question of failure in the mind of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, when, in the dark days of 1842, he penned the words, "Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!" (D&amp;amp;C 128:22).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take Courage!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I say to you: Courage, young people! These are great times and there are great things to be accomplished. Develop your talents; do not hide them under a bushel. Prepare prayerfully, increase in faith and you will never have need to fear. We declare with the poet, Longfellow:

&lt;i&gt;Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Our faith triumphant oer our fears&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are all with thee - are all with thee!&lt;/i&gt;
[The Building of the Ship, 1849]

God bless and guide you, protect and inspire you. I testify to you of my love for the Lord Jesus Christ and bear especial witness of him as the risen Lord. I know truly that he is the Savior of the world. This is the living Church of the living Christ, and he speaks through a living prophet. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My dear young friends, I would like to share with you today some thoughts on the futility of fear.</p>
<p>Anciently the Lord spoke to Isaac, saying, "Fear not, for I am with thee" (Genesis 26:24). The admonition to "fear not" was clear and direct and meaningful. The promise that "I am with thee" was equally plain and direct and powerful.</p>
<h2><b>Freedom from Fear Is Essential</b></h2>
<p>Down through the ages the same admonition, the same assurance, has been extended to every living soul who is willing to qualify. And yet fear is prevalent throughout the earth. It stifles initiative, saps strength, and reduces efficiency. It weakens faith, brings doubts, and begets mistrust. Indeed, it tends to impede the very business of being. How negative, frustrating, and futile is fear.</p>
<p>Let us consider together then the futility of fear, so that we may overcome it and exclude it from our lives as much as possible. Then shall our efforts yield their full potential, and out minds will be unshackled and enlightened with eternal truth. Indeed, one of the four essential human freedoms listed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a message to Congress, is "Freedom from Fear" (January 6, 1941).</p>
<p>As we embark together on this brief voyage of discovery, I trust that we will grasp the helm of faith to guide us through some troubled waters. Emily Brontes immortal words are apt.</p>
<p><i>No coward soul is mine,</i><br />
<i>No trembler in the worlds storm-troubled sphere:</i><br />
<i>I see Heavens glories shine,</i><br />
<i>And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.</i><br />
[<i>Last Lines,</i> 1846]</p>
<p>How shall we then arm ourselves from fear?</p>
<h2><b>Ten Aspects of Fear</b></h2>
<p>Just like people, fear comes in all shapes and sizes. There are those who fear people; others fear things. Many fear the future, and some fear the past. Where do you fit in? I will present ten aspects of the futility of fear, and I trust that this sharing will be beneficial, uplifting, and arming.</p>
<p><b>First,</b> there is fear of God. Among all of the possible fears, this is the only one that is valid. However, it is not fear in the normal sense of lack of courage, but rather love, respect, and reverence. Indeed, fear of God in this sense can dispel all other fears. Two examples are the assurance and admonition to the Israelites, "the Lord is with us: fear them not" (Numbers 14:9), and Apostle Pauls rhetorical question, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31), meaning "who can prevail against us?" (JST Romans 8:31).</p>
<p>Fear, or love, of God also brings many other blessings besides courage. "It shall be well with them that fear God" (Ecclesiastes 8:12), for he is "gracious unto those who fear" him (D&amp;C 76:5). Yes, fear, or love, of God releases us, frees us, just as acceptance of truth does, for "the truth shall make [us] free" (John 8:32).</p>
<p><b>Second</b>, there is fear of man. There are those who fear physical domination by others. The Psalmist gave good counsel that we should "not fear what flesh can do unto [us]" (Psalms 56:4). Solomon also gave the wise saying that "fear of man bringeth a snare" (Proverbs 29:25). It is hard for a child to realize this when someone sets upon him. Experience teaches that it is futile to be afraid, for fear attracts the attention of the bully and the derision of those who mock.</p>
<p>The Lord, through Moses, declared with firmness to the Israelites:</p>
<p><i>When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. </i>[Deuteronomy 20:1]</p>
<p>To return good for evil not only overcomes fear, but also overcomes enmity. I remember when we had an unfriendly neighbor some years ago. He would play the radio very loudly and generally try to be objectionable - so much as to generate fear. I am glad I was prompted to retain a positive, cheerful demeanor which overcame fear and eventually broke down the barrier, for "perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).</p>
<p><b>Third,</b> much more prevalent than physical fear, is the fear of criticism, rejection, and verbal opposition. Again, the scriptures are replete with counsel and admonition. In latter-day revelation to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, the Lord said, in relation to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript of the Book of Mormon, "You should not have feared man more than God" (D&amp;C 3:7).</p>
<p>Saul was rejected as king because, as he confessed to Samuel, "I feared the people, and obeyed their voice" (1 Samuel 15:24). Will you transgress the commandments of the Lord because you fear what others will say if you dont follow them in the ways of the world? "Fear ye not the reproach of men," the Lord counseled through Isaiah (Isaiah 51:7). In more recent times he has chided those who "will not open their mouths [to share the gospel] . . . because of the fear of man" (D&amp;C 60:2).</p>
<p>When we have something to tell others which will benefit them, protect them, or enlighten them, we should not hold back. There are so many people who are confused and discouraged, and who want a better way of life. How grateful they are when someone takes the time to share their happiness and purpose in life. Will you seek to share even more? You are a great power for good, providing your righteous potential is harnessed by service.</p>
<p>While I served as mission president in Scotland from 1975 to 1978, the Church received considerable opposition and criticism. On one occasion, three ministers made derogatory public statements in a particular city. I wrote an open letter to the local newspaper announcing that we would be holding a public meeting in that city to dispel some of the misunderstandings which were being voiced around. It was a wonderful meeting. We first showed the fine Church film "Meet the Mormons," and then I spoke to the large group concerning our beliefs and way of life. When we opened the meeting for questions, a number of people who were not members of the Church stood and said kind things about the Church and the Latter-day Saints they knew. Positive results ensued and the work moved forward.</p>
<p>What if we had feared the criticism? I remember receiving a telephone call from a missionary who was obviously a little fearful. He said, "President, what shall we do? We have a man from the local church who follows us wherever we go and tries to stop us from knocking on the doors."</p>
<p>The young missionary was surprised at my response. "Good," I said. "You will have much success there, for the adversary is getting worried." I told him of the experience of the early missionaries to the British Isles, just before the first baptisms took place in Preston. Elder Heber C. Kimball, grandfather of our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball, recorded it as follows:</p>
<p><i>By this time the adversary of souls began to rage, and he felt determined to destroy us before we had fully established the kingdom of God in that land, and the next morning I witnessed a scene of satanic power and influence which I shall never forget. </i>[Orson F. Whitney, <i>Life of Heber C. Kimball </i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1888), p. 143]</p>
<p>After my wife and I were baptized in January 1951, many of our neighbors shunned us, sometimes crossing the street so they would not meet us face-to-face. This did not affect our attitude, however, and we would greet them normally. It was not long before they would come to us and say, "We have a child who is ill, would you pray for her?" or "I have a problem. Would you please give me some counsel and advice?"</p>
<p>There is never any need to fear opposition, criticism, or persecution, for we know what will be the outcome. The Lords work goes forward even more strongly, for</p>
<p><i>the works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men. </i>[D&amp;C 3:1, 3]</p>
<p><b>Fourth,</b> there are some who fear events, such as examinations and tests, interviews and journeys. These are all challenges which we need to shoulder. Fear usually brings failure. The Savior warned of "mens hearts failing them for fear" (Luke 21:26). Eleanor Roosevelt said, "You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face" (<i>You Learn by Living</i>, 1960).</p>
<p>There is an excellent example of this when Elishas servant discovered that the Syrian army had surrounded the city of Dothan, wherein they dwelt. Fearfully, he said to the prophet, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?"</p>
<p>Elisha answered him firmly: "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:1516). Well could he say this, for "Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6:17).</p>
<p>One lesson we have to learn is that fear is the beginning of defeat. On the other hand, courage is the beginning of success. We gain courage by the realization that we have a lot going for us. We derive strength from the knowledge that the Lord is with us. To Abraham he declared, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield" (Genesis 15:1). This is exactly what we need in this tempting, permissive world - a shield to protect us from the "fiery darts of the wicked" (D&amp;C 27:17).</p>
<p>One great event that some people fear is referred to as "the end of the world." We know that at the second coming of Jesus Christ it will be the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Malachi 4:5, D&amp;C 110:14) - dread being a synonym for fear. We can make it a great day for us, though, rather than a dreadful day. How? By qualifying, by complying, by following the Lord. It is futile to be afraid when we could be "looking forth for the great day of the Lord" (D&amp;C 45:39).</p>
<p>As a young boy, not quite thirteen years of age, in September 1939, it was natural to have some momentary fear when I heard that war had been declared. Some of the children even speculated about the end of the world coming in those dark days that followed, when the invasion of England seemed imminent, and bombs were falling all around. We were not really afraid, however, for we had faith in God. We prayed and worked for deliverance, and miraculously it came.</p>
<p>Another futile fear that I dispelled some years later was the fear of heights. We were building our new chapel in Nottingham, England, with all the members helping. My specialty was laying floor tile and placing acoustic ceiling tile, mainly in the corridors and classrooms. There was a call for someone to fix some ceiling tiles at the very apex of the chapel ceiling. I dont know the height, but as I started to climb the ladder, it seemed like scaling Mount Everest. On reaching the top I had to measure exactly, then descend the ladder, cut the tiles to shape and size, climb once again and fit them in place. Certainly, the best way to overcome fear of heights is to "do it," as President Kimball has challenged. In fact, he has said, "Give me another mountain."</p>
<p><b>Fifth,</b> another event which strikes fear and apprehension into the hearts of many, is death. The prophet Mormon speaks of "that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked" (Mormon 6:7). This particular fear arises from misunderstanding of the purpose of life and lack of knowledge of the plan of our Eternal Father. It is vital to come to an understanding that death is not the end, but a new beginning, a necessary stage in our eternal progression. Fear of death accomplishes nothing if we are righteous, for "death is swallowed up in victory. . . . victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:54, 57).</p>
<p>David, the shepherd/psalmist, gave us those magnificent words of comfort:</p>
<p><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i> [Psalms 23:4]</p>
<p>Speaking of death in this way gives the Lords perspective, whereas talking fearfully of death creates fear and uneasiness.</p>
<p>Some years ago, a dear young friend of ours, Pat, was stricken with cancer. She was not afraid of death, but was concerned about her small children. She did not want to leave them while they were so young. Her great faith and courage were rewarded and she was granted a few vital years to care for her family before she peacefully passed away.</p>
<p>I think of another very dear friend, Joan, our closest friend in the Church, who was tragically killed by a car as she crossed a pedestrian walkway in Salt Lake City. She certainly did not fear death, for she was fully prepared. Everything was in order, in her personal life and in her personal papers. She was ready to meet the Lord.</p>
<p><b>Sixth,</b> we will consider other fears of the unknown. These may be experienced in a number of ways: fear of the dark, fear of change, fear of the future. Such fear can be overcome by faith, as the Lord showed as he rebuked the winds and the sea. "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" he challenged his disciples (Matthew 8:26).</p>
<p>The Lords disciples succumbed to this type of fear on several occasions. When they saw Jesus walking on the water, he comforted them, saying, "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid" (Matthew 14:27). Again, when he appeared to them after his resurrection, they were "terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit." He developed faith within them as he asked them to "handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke 24:37, 39).</p>
<p>Reassurance from others is an important step toward faith. For example, there is the comfort given by parents to children afraid of the dark, or by a wife to a husband about to change his place of work. I remember during my Royal Air Force service in India and Burma, during World War II, one of our colleagues was always imagining a twisted stick to be a snake. We had to reassure him on numerous occasions to allay his fears. As Theseus remarked in Shakespeares <i>A Midsummer-Nights Dream</i>: "Or in the night, imagining some fear, / How easy is a bush supposd a bear!" (act 5, scene 1).</p>
<p>Again, concerning the future, is it unknown? The Lord has told us much about the future through his prophets. "Fear not," he has counseled, "let your hearts be comforted" (D&amp;C 98:1). "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;C 38:30).</p>
<p>The pattern of the scriptures is first a commandment, then a promise. Providing we live our lives in harmony with the commandments of God, there is no place for fear regarding the consequences. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I have a strong testimony of this - for while we have not sought for worldly possessions, we have always had sufficient for our needs since we put our hands to the gospel plough.</p>
<p><b>Seventh,</b> we have fear of responsibility. I remember just after I joined the Church, a great feeling of confidence came over me. I felt that since I had chosen the Lords side, he was on my side. Several remarkable things happened, of which I will recount but two.</p>
<p>Although I had never had the courage to stand on my feet and speak in debate, either at high school or college, I found myself asking my branch president if I might give a talk in sacrament meeting. I still have the notes of that very first talk. It was on faith and works.</p>
<p>A few months after my baptism, a golden opportunity presented itself at my place of work, where I was a management trainee. Again I had that strong feeling of self-assurance, and I received my first promotion, which set my feet on the management ladder. I found that through my Church membership and the faith it engendered, I overcame the fear of taking responsibility.</p>
<p>I have always loved reading the Apostle Pauls epistles to Timothy and particularly cherish this advice: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7). I have learned to rely on the Comforter, even the Holy Ghost, to give me the feeling of peace and confidence, and to bring things to my remembrance.</p>
<p>Said the Savior: "Whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear" (D&amp;C 10:55). How true that is, for in his Church the gift of the Holy Ghost is available to all. We can have the promptings of impending danger, as I have had on several occasions. We can have the discerning of places we should not go and things we should not do. It is futile to fear when the Holy Ghost is with you and the Lord himself is "on your right hand and on your left" (D&amp;C 84:88).</p>
<p>What of marriage responsibility? Are there some who delay marriage for fear of the responsibility? When my wife and I were married, we had the magnificent sum of twenty English pounds between us. Although young, we felt ready for the challenges and responsibilities that we knew lay ahead. What a glorious experience it has been for almost forty years now to shoulder responsibility and struggle together in building a happy home and a wonderful family of ten precious children.</p>
<p>From time to time I meet members of the Church who do not feel able to take responsibility as an officer or a teacher in the Church. I tell them of my experience in England. Literally within days of baptism I was called to head the youth program in the Nottingham branch. This was completely new to me and I felt inadequate, but I knew the Lord needed me. There were less than 7,000 members in the whole of the British Isles where there are now 40 stakes. We all had to be "anxiously engaged" in the work of saving souls, building the kingdom, and establishing Zion. So it is with all of us. It is futile to fear responsibility when we have been called to serve "by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority" (Articles of Faith 1:5).</p>
<p><b>Eighth</b> is fear of loneliness. Linked with this is the fear of being in a small minority. This type of fear often results in compromise of principles and giving in to the demands of others for fear of being lonely, or being the odd one out. In latter-day revelation, the Lord has given comfort and assurance to those in this situation.</p>
<p><i>Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</i> [D&amp;C 6:34]</p>
<p>Fear of loneliness includes fear of not having anyone to talk to, or being without help in time of need. These fears can be conquered by reaching out and giving service to others, becoming outward-looking instead of inward-looking. In order to have a friend, we must be a friend.</p>
<p>I think of dear Sister Amy Gent, who I was privileged to visit for fifteen years as a branch president, home teacher, and friend. The first time I visited her, she was eighty-seven years of age, and I was later honored to speak at the funeral of this wonderful lady who stepped from this life at age one hundred and two. Widowed twice, she was the only member of the Church in her extended family. Was she lonely? Never!</p>
<p>She read the scriptures every day and once asked me to take her some missionary tracts, which I thought were to vary her reading. I gave them to her, saying, "You will enjoy reading these, Sister Gent."</p>
<p>"Oh, they are not for me," she replied. "I visit an old lady and I want to share the gospel with her!"</p>
<p>Reaching out, helping, serving - this is the way we overcome the fear of loneliness.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a brother complained to me, "When I was away on business recently, in another part of the country, I went to church and no one spoke to me. I felt very lonely, especially as I was so far from home."</p>
<p>I paused and then asked, "How many people did you speak to?" At first he was a little annoyed, feeling I had not empathized, but then he smiled and said, "Youre right, I did hold back instead of reaching out."</p>
<p><b>Ninth,</b> fear of the past haunts those who have transgressed and have not yet gained forgiveness and remission. It holds them back, but this should be but a temporary phase. As President Kimball has counseled:</p>
<p><i>To cure spiritual diseases which throttle us and plague our lives, the Lord has given us a sure cure - repentance.</i> [<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness </i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), preface]</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord has given us a wonderful formula to enable us to remove fear and guilt:</p>
<p><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i></p>
<p><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins - behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i> [D&amp;C 58:4243]</p>
<p>Once we confess, we need have no more fear about being found out. What a tremendous burden is lifted, which otherwise would weigh us down interminably. Confession is the first major step in the process of repentance. Sincere repentance is many-faceted; it is more than confession. There must needs be a forsaking and turning away from transgression in all its sordid forms.</p>
<p>Then we can look forward to and, indeed, claim fulfillment of the promise of the Lord, that he will not only forgive, but remember our sins no more. What a contrast to the lot of those of whom Isaiah speaks:</p>
<p><i>Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? And who knoweth us?</i> [Isaiah 29:15]</p>
<p>On a number of occasions I have had the happy assignment to meet with those who have prepared to come back into the fullness of gospel blessings. What a great day it is for them. Fear of the past has fled and they are starting out anew. It is good to be able to say to them, "Today is the first day of the rest of your lives."</p>
<p>We need to spring-clean our lives, sweep out each nook and cranny and under the carpet. In the world of industry and commerce, which used to be my environment, regular inventory is taken. At these times, decisions are made to eliminate certain items from the inventory and to mark other items down in value.</p>
<p>We should take inventory in our lives, as did Scrooge, and cast out the dross so that we become unencumbered and free from fear of the past.</p>
<p>When recommendations are being considered for appointment to public office, investigation of the personal life and affairs of the nominee is becoming more frequent. Whether we have aspirations for success in the political, business, academic, or other spheres of activity, we should endeavor to keep ourselves "unspotted from the world" (James 1:27). In order not to fear the past, try not to do anything in the present that you will regret in the future.</p>
<p><b>Tenth</b>, and finally, there is fear of failure. There are those who will not even attempt to do something because they lack the self-assurance that they could accomplish it. I was raised with the old adage ringing in my ears, "If at first you dont succeed, try, try again." There is no disgrace in failure, and in any case, we have never failed until we give up. The four-minute mile eluded athletes for many years, but after trying again and again, Dr. Roger Bannister finally achieved it. Since then, athletes from many lands have broken this seeming barrier.</p>
<p>President N. Eldon Tanner remarked on one occasion, "One of the evils of the world today is not failure, but low aim." Just as we should not fear to fail, neither should we fear to aim high. There was no question of failure in the mind of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, when, in the dark days of 1842, he penned the words, "Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!" (D&amp;C 128:22).</p>
<h2><b>Take Courage!</b></h2>
<p>I say to you: Courage, young people! These are great times and there are great things to be accomplished. Develop your talents; do not hide them under a bushel. Prepare prayerfully, increase in faith and you will never have need to fear. We declare with the poet, Longfellow:</p>
<p><i>Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,</i><br />
<i>Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,</i><br />
<i>Our faith triumphant oer our fears</i><br />
<i>Are all with thee - are all with thee!</i><br />
[The Building of the Ship, 1849]</p>
<p>God bless and guide you, protect and inspire you. I testify to you of my love for the Lord Jesus Christ and bear especial witness of him as the risen Lord. I know truly that he is the Savior of the world. This is the living Church of the living Christ, and he speaks through a living prophet. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a joy to join with Peggy in welcoming you to another school year. You are a wonderful sight, and this campus takes on new energy as you arrive here. We are grateful for that.
My message today focuses on one of the most oft-repeated and yet most oft-overlooked and ignored and maybe violated commandments. By my count this commandment is repeated seventy-six times in the scriptures.1 The commandment was the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christs birth to the shepherds outside Bethlehem.2 It was also the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christs Resurrection to the women at the empty tomb.3 The commandment was conveyed by the angels who informed Mary and Joseph about their roles in the Saviors mortal ministry,4 and it was part of the message of the angel who appeared to Zacharias to reveal the upcoming birth of John the Baptist.5 The commandment is repeated in at least two of our LDS hymns.6 It is a commandment that is found so frequently in the scriptures that we may not recognize its profound importance, especially for the times in which we live and the stage of life in which you students find yourselves. The commandment is a simple two-word injunction: "fear not."
Some may question whether the directive to "fear not" is actually a commandment. True, it is not preceded by the familiar "thou shalt not," and it was not written on stone tablets. But it is clearly an imperative repeated often enough by divinely authorized sources, including many times by the Savior Himself,7 that it certainly seems like a commandment. More important, like all commandments, adherence to this two-word injunction will make our mortal journey both more productive and more joyful.
This is not a new topic. It has been preached over this pulpit8 as well as over the pulpit in the LDS Conference Center.9 But I believe it is one that is of particular relevance as we begin a new school year with all of its challenges in a world that seems increasingly full of fears. I firmly believe that if we increase our compliance with this important commandment, the coming year and the endless years that succeed it will be better.
With that belief in mind, let me first explore the meaning of this sometimes misunderstood commandment and then describe four things we can do to increase our ability to comply with its principles.
What Is Fear?
To understand the commandment to fear not, we first have to understand what we mean by fear. What exactly are we supposed to avoid? According to one source, "fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that . . . ultimately [leads to] a change in behavior."10 As this broad definition suggests, not all fear is bad. Were it not f</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Play Through Your Mistakes
Music has always been a very important part of my life. Nearly every major memory of my childhood involves music of some kind: singing with my family on road trips to pass the time; learning barbershop music with my mom and sisters; listening to the Tijuana Brass band on the record player while decorating our Christmas tree; singing my fathers favorite song, "Love at Home" (see Hymns, 2002, no. 294), for family home evening; and admiring my mother as she played the organ in our sacrament meeting every week - something she still does at the young age of eighty. Given that music played such a prominent role in my youth, it will not surprise you to know that I took piano lessons for ten years, from the age of eight to seventeen.
My first piano teacher - we will call her Mrs. Smith - was very strict and had high expectations for mastery. During my lesson she would often follow the music with a pencil as I played. Sometimes, after I hit a sour note or used the wrong fingering, Mrs. Smith would flick my fingers with that pencil. She intended to help me recognize the mistake so that I could correct it. Unfortunately, after several experiences with the dreaded pencil, I learned that the least painful way to handle my musical mistakes was to remove my hands from the keys as quickly as possible.
This habit of abruptly stopping after a mistake was also unintentionally reinforced when I would practice at home. Our piano was positioned on a wall that was opposite our kitchen; in fact, it was back-to-back with our stove. I would often practice while my mother was making dinner on the other side of the wall. When I would make a mistake, she would make a staccato "ah" sound. Startled, my hands would fly from the keys.
I know this was not the intended outcome because I heard her do the same thing when she made her own mistakes at the organ or piano. She still does this today, but only in practice. When she is at the organ or piano for performance, there are few errors, but when they occur, they are hardly noticeable. She can play right on through a mistake like nothing happened. I, on the other hand, cannot.
Most of my piano recitals with Mrs. Smith took place in the chapel of my home ward building. These were reverent occasions - no clapping after the end of each performance, just polite smiles from the audience as we each took our turn at the grand piano. We were not allowed to use our music, so for me, the walk up those three velvety red steps to the piano felt like walking into a battle unarmed. I was terrified that I would make a mistake, take my hands from the keys, and be unable to find the right placement again.
This terror of performing would follow me into adulthood. When I was still in the early years of my public accounting career and had two small children at home, I was called as the Relief Society pianist.
The first week was a disaster. I lur</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to explain the sequence of how I was first contacted to speak at this devotional. It was on a Monday that I got a text message from a number I didnt recognize. It had been a hectic day, and I didnt read the text fully. Thinking it was a request to speak at an upcoming Church assignment, I texted back politely asking who the text was from.
Matthew O. Richardson, BYU advancement vice president, responded that it was he who had sent the text asking me to speak at a BYU devotional.
The first thought that popped into my mind was, "Are you crazy? Do you not realize that I can barely speak the English language, let alone speak in front of so many people?"
My wife, who was with me at the time, responded without hesitation, "That is desperation, not inspiration!"
I texted President Richardson back with, "I think you have the wrong Craig Manning."
He then replied, "Oops, sorry, I do have the wrong person!" But he then clarified that he did have the right person.
As intimidating as it is to speak in front of you, the experience of preparing for this devotional has been great. I have found that every time I have put on the radio, in every activity I have participated in, and with every thought I have had, I have double-checked myself to make sure I was in alignment with the Holy Ghost so as to have the Spirit with me. I do pray that the Spirit will be with me today as I deliver my thoughts.
I would like to talk to you today about a couple of life-changing lessons the Lord has taught me.
I was born and raised in Canberra, Australia. My mother was, and still is, a Catholic, and my father was a member of the Church of England before he passed away from cancer twenty years ago. We attended church on Sundays, and I attended Sunday School, completing my first Holy Communion. As I got older, I started playing rugby. Games were on Sundays, and it wasnt long before we stopped attending church.
I remember coming home from a rugby game one Sunday when my mother said to me, "You are really good at sports, so you wont be very good at school."
This statement confused me. Although I didnt have the maturity and clarity of thought at the time to articulate my emotions, I can look back now and see why this statement bothered me. Was there some phenomenon that controlled my destiny? I couldnt help being good at sports; it just seemed to happen. Every time I participated in an athletic contest, I was reminded that I was a good athlete. So did that mean I had no chance of ever being a good student, and did I have any say in any of this?
I dont share this story to accuse my mother of bad parenting but rather to illustrate what can happen when we dont understand the Lords plan or, more important, when we dont learn to live and apply the gospel of Jesus Christ. I spent my teenage years focusing the majority of my attention on sports, par</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you for that beautiful and calming musical number. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today and for the support of family, colleagues, students, and friends who are here.
I invite you to reflect on the last time you experienced the feeling of fear. Was it while wondering if you would be admitted into one of the many competitive degree programs here at Brigham Young University? Or while waiting to see if the girl you asked out wants to go out again? Or, worse yet, while wondering what to do when she does? For me, the feeling is as recent as sitting on this stand, looking into the faces of so many and knowing that, through the miracle of technology, thousands more are watching this message. Like you, I can testify that the feeling of fear is real. Elder David A. Bednar taught about this powerful emotion in last Aprils general conference: "Notably, one of the first effects of the Fall was for Adam and Eve to experience fear. This potent emotion is an important element of our mortal existence."1
Today I want to visit with you about overcoming the fears that are an essential part of our experience in this earth life.
Fear of an Unknown Future
One of my favorite classes to teach here on campus is the Doctrine and Covenants because I find it highly relevant in my own life and in the lives of my students. In a well-known episode from the text, Oliver Cowdery, the primary scribe for the translation of the Book of Mormon, was offered the opportunity of a lifetime: to join Joseph Smith as a translator of that sacred book of scripture. Oliver was instructed:
Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and that you may translate and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are sacred; and according to your faith shall it be done unto you.2
Shortly thereafter, when Oliver failed in his attempt to translate a portion of the Book of Mormon, the Lord explained the reasons for his failure. Outlining several causes, the Lord declared, "And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you."3 Furthermore, He added, "Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time is past, and it is not expedient now."4
I have long wondered what it was that Oliver feared that caused him to not continue as he had commenced. Knowing that the project was of eternal importance, did he fear making a mistake and thus marring the sacred publication?
I was the age of most of you when this scriptural episode came to have special meaning for me. I was in graduate school here at BYU, and I began asking out a particular girl. And, as things progressed, I became scared. Like Ol</span>
