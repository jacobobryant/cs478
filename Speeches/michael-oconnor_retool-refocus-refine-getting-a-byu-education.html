  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="The sight of this  sea of blue robes is impressive and inspiring, and this collective vision is the evidence of your  individual dedication and sacrifice. We recognize that your graduation today was not easily  accomplished. But then, you did not come to BYU because it was easy.

As the rover  &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; begins the exploration of Mars this week, let us look back already fifty years ago,  when President John F. Kennedy challenged the Rice University student body and the nation to seek  new and difficult horizons. He proposed the conquest of literally reaching for the moon. He said:

&lt;i&gt;Some say, . . . why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest  mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?&lt;/i&gt; [Why does BYU play  Utah, Boise State, George Tech, or Notre Dame?]

&lt;i&gt;. . . We choose to go to the moon in this  decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that  goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge  is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to  win.&lt;/i&gt; [John F. Kennedy, “Moon Speech” to Rice University, 12 September 1962, Houston, Texas;  http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm]

Our audience in the Marriott Center today is filled  with students who were not willing to accept anything less than the challenge of a BYU  education—even when such an education seemed unlikely or even impossible.

Only 56 percent of  the freshmen who applied for BYU’s upcoming class were ­admitted—the lowest acceptance rate  ever. One of your fellow graduates, Megan Nelson Olsen, was a casualty of the tough admissions  standards at BYU as a freshman, but she refused to abandon her dream of graduating from this  university. She persevered and ­developed a new plan. Her goal was clear, and, even when she  got discouraged, she relied on prayer and never stopped believing in her goal. After excelling in  her studies, Megan was admitted to BYU winter semester 2010. Megan’s experiences at BYU and, also  important, the process of getting into BYU, were life changing. Once admitted, she was an  enthusiastic student body member. She felt it was a blessing to study here and never took her  opportunities for granted.

Another student, Bryon Glazier, is also graduating today, having  completed the executive MBA program. This program allowed Bryon to return to BYU after eight years  and pursue an advanced degree while supporting his wife and their growing family. His wife, Sherry,  had previously postponed her own BYU experience when she discovered a cancerous tumor in her leg  just weeks before her freshman year was to begin. When Bryon entered the program, Sherry was  pregnant and caring for their four-year-old twins. Bryon sacrificed sleep, time with his family, and  even attending BYU sporting events. Everyone who knows Bryon knows this was a tremendous sacrifice.  (Although he does admit to missing one class to see Jimmer play in his last home game.) Through the  perseverance often required by struggling young student families, Bryon and Sherry learned they  could do hard things in the short-term to achieve success in their long-term goals. Although  graduation diplomas are individually awarded, they are often the result of a combined  effort.

Many of your sacrifices mirror the experiences of these students. Make sure you take  time today to thank all those who have helped you to be here today. Congratulations to Megan, Bryon,  and all of the graduates for your tremendous accomplishments.

Allow me to share some counsel  that President Gordon B. Hinckley offered at BYU’s 1999 commencement:

&lt;i&gt;Go forward now with  your lives. Take from this institution the faith that has nurtured and sustained you while you have  been here. Take with you the great values under which you have lived while you have been here—not  only the knowledge that you have gained in your classrooms but also that inner thing which speaks  and says, “I can do a little better than I have been doing.” Take that with you, please.&lt;/i&gt; [BYU  commencement remarks, 12 August 1999]

Continue to give your all in all that you do. Take with  you the pride of being a BYU graduate. Give back to the university whenever and however you can.  Take a moment to reflect how far you have come.

A BYU education is not easy to accomplish. But  you have retooled, refocused, and refined yourselves by experiencing a university that blends  secular and spiritual truths. Congratulations, Cougars.

As president of the Alumni  Association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University  Alumni Association. Again, we offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association  of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful  activities associated with the university.

In the sacred name of Jesus Christ,  amen.

&lt;i&gt;Michael O’Connor was president of the BYU Alumni  Association when this commencement address was given on 9 August 2012.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>The sight of this  sea of blue robes is impressive and inspiring, and this collective vision is the evidence of your  individual dedication and sacrifice. We recognize that your graduation today was not easily  accomplished. But then, you did not come to BYU because it was easy.</p>
<p>As the rover  <i>Curiosity</i> begins the exploration of Mars this week, let us look back already fifty years ago,  when President John F. Kennedy challenged the Rice University student body and the nation to seek  new and difficult horizons. He proposed the conquest of literally reaching for the moon. He said:</p>
<p><i>Some say, . . . why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest  mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</i> [Why does BYU play  Utah, Boise State, George Tech, or Notre Dame?]</p>
<p><i>. . . We choose to go to the moon in this  decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that  goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge  is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to  win.</i> [John F. Kennedy, “Moon Speech” to Rice University, 12 September 1962, Houston, Texas;  http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm]</p>
<p>Our audience in the Marriott Center today is filled  with students who were not willing to accept anything less than the challenge of a BYU  education—even when such an education seemed unlikely or even impossible.</p>
<p>Only 56 percent of  the freshmen who applied for BYU’s upcoming class were ­admitted—the lowest acceptance rate  ever. One of your fellow graduates, Megan Nelson Olsen, was a casualty of the tough admissions  standards at BYU as a freshman, but she refused to abandon her dream of graduating from this  university. She persevered and ­developed a new plan. Her goal was clear, and, even when she  got discouraged, she relied on prayer and never stopped believing in her goal. After excelling in  her studies, Megan was admitted to BYU winter semester 2010. Megan’s experiences at BYU and, also  important, the process of getting into BYU, were life changing. Once admitted, she was an  enthusiastic student body member. She felt it was a blessing to study here and never took her  opportunities for granted.</p>
<p>Another student, Bryon Glazier, is also graduating today, having  completed the executive MBA program. This program allowed Bryon to return to BYU after eight years  and pursue an advanced degree while supporting his wife and their growing family. His wife, Sherry,  had previously postponed her own BYU experience when she discovered a cancerous tumor in her leg  just weeks before her freshman year was to begin. When Bryon entered the program, Sherry was  pregnant and caring for their four-year-old twins. Bryon sacrificed sleep, time with his family, and  even attending BYU sporting events. Everyone who knows Bryon knows this was a tremendous sacrifice.  (Although he does admit to missing one class to see Jimmer play in his last home game.) Through the  perseverance often required by struggling young student families, Bryon and Sherry learned they  could do hard things in the short-term to achieve success in their long-term goals. Although  graduation diplomas are individually awarded, they are often the result of a combined  effort.</p>
<p>Many of your sacrifices mirror the experiences of these students. Make sure you take  time today to thank all those who have helped you to be here today. Congratulations to Megan, Bryon,  and all of the graduates for your tremendous accomplishments.</p>
<p>Allow me to share some counsel  that President Gordon B. Hinckley offered at BYU’s 1999 commencement:</p>
<p><i>Go forward now with  your lives. Take from this institution the faith that has nurtured and sustained you while you have  been here. Take with you the great values under which you have lived while you have been here—not  only the knowledge that you have gained in your classrooms but also that inner thing which speaks  and says, “I can do a little better than I have been doing.” Take that with you, please.</i> [BYU  commencement remarks, 12 August 1999]</p>
<p>Continue to give your all in all that you do. Take with  you the pride of being a BYU graduate. Give back to the university whenever and however you can.  Take a moment to reflect how far you have come.</p>
<p>A BYU education is not easy to accomplish. But  you have retooled, refocused, and refined yourselves by experiencing a university that blends  secular and spiritual truths. Congratulations, Cougars.</p>
<p>As president of the Alumni  Association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University  Alumni Association. Again, we offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association  of more than 370,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful  activities associated with the university.</p>
<p>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ,  amen.</p>
<p><i>Michael O’Connor was president of the BYU Alumni  Association when this commencement address was given on 9 August 2012.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
