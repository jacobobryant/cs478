  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Throughout history, stable societies have recognized (and protected) the family as the basic unit of society precisely because the family is the social unit that has the primary responsibility for rearing and educating children. The family has successfully performed these fundamental tasks, in large part, because peaceful existence within a secure family demands that family members recognize (and respect) not just "rights" but communal responsibilities. During the latter half of this century, however, a modern emphasis on autonomy has shifted the focus of academic and governmental energies away from the recognition of (and respect for) communal responsibilities to a focus on "individual rights."

An outstanding example is the United Nation&#039;s Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention establishes previously unrecognized autonomy "rights" for children and interposes government between children and their parents to an unprecedented degree. The convention, in the words of Elder Bruce Hafen, goes a long way toward "abandoning children to their autonomy."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This abandonment of our children - and our families - continues apace. For example, in New York last week, my associate Kay (Kathryn Balmforth), who is another director of NGO Family Voice (also known as the World Family Policy Center), attended a preparatory meeting for the five-year review of the International Conference on Population and Development. There Kay watched for three days while the attendees of this important conference debated whether they would even include a reference to "parents" in a document that purportedly created a child&#039;s right to sexual freedom, sexual training, and reproductive choice. At this important international meeting, it seemed that the mere mention of parental guidance on sexual matters was anathema.

The social consequences have been disastrous. In the words of Elder Hafen, because of the "emerging but misguided tendency among some adults to defer increasingly to children&#039;s preferences," the modern world may well fail to encourage the "development of the personal competence needed to produce an ongoing democratic society comprised of persons capable of . . . responsible action."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; It is time to appreciate (and correct) the consequences of the modern focus on autonomy and of disregard of the family. It is time to recognize and reemphasize the central role of the family community in creating and maintaining a stable society. It is time, in short, to direct some of the energy we have lavished on protection of the individual to the defense and protection of the family. Without this defense, the family, the most basic community of all, may be imperiled.

I first became involved with issues of family policy and society in June 1996, when, almost by accident, I attended a U.N. conference in Istanbul, Turkey. The conference, known as Habitat II,&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was the culmination of a decade-long series of conferences designed to develop a "blueprint" for international (and ultimately domestic) legal relations during the coming century.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; These conferences have been accurately perceived as significant international law-making events.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; They have also followed a predictable (and extreme) ideological course primarily championed by a powerful lobby that, according to one scholar, "ha[s] marginalized parents, ignored the family, and denigrated cultural and religious values."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; What made the Istanbul conference remarkable was that it departed from this set course.

As a result of an unusual series of events, I was selected to give a short four-minute speech before one of the drafting committees at the Habitat conference. The speakers who took the podium before me urged the conferees to recognize same-sex partnerships, increase funding for adolescent sexual reproductive services, provide 18 to 20 hours a day of government-sponsored day care, and take all "necessary steps" to insure that every woman was "fully employed" outside the home. Marriage and family, if noted at all by these speakers, were referenced primarily as institutions that reinforce odious cultural stereotypes and that subjugate and demean women. My message was rather different.

I began my remarks by informing the conferees that the family - as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other important U.N. documents - is the fundamental unit of society. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the fundamental unit, moreover, precisely because it is the laboratory where little boys learn to love, respect, and work with little girls, and where little girls learn the same essential skills in dealing with little boys. I reminded the delegates that if we don&#039;t learn these skills within the home, there is little chance that we will learn them elsewhere. Accordingly, I urged the delegates to do what they could to strengthen the family rather than expend the vast majority of their energies and time creating substitute social structures - or, perhaps even worse, creating legal structures to intervene in and disarrange the family.

I pointed out, for example, that extensive studies had shown that the incidence of teenage pregnancy and abortions actually &lt;i&gt;increases&lt;/i&gt; following the initiation of "traditional" sex education programs that emphasize the teaching of technical sexual "know-how," including the use of prophylactics. By contrast, however, the incidence of adolescent pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted disease is dramatically reduced through family-based education programs.

At the conclusion of my short remarks, I emphasized the essential message of the First Presidency&#039;s proclamation on the family&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;: that there is a "fundamental connection" between a decent society and "the reinforcement of strong, stable families."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; The "traditional family," I reminded the delegates in Istanbul,

&lt;i&gt;is the necessary foundation for . . . larger communities because it is the sanctuary where women and men learn cooperation, sacrifice, love, and mutual support; it is the training ground where children learn the public virtues of responsibility, work, fair play, and social interdependence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

The basic structure of society, I asserted, "is built from the fundamental values fostered by strong families."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; I concluded by urging the conferees to consider seriously the need to protect traditional values in drafting and implementing the Habitat Agenda.

The reaction to the speech was remarkable. Many of the speakers who had preceded me at the podium hissed as I returned to my seat. But most of the delegates in the audience gave me a standing ovation. Indeed, after the speech I was approached by the ambassador from Saudi Arabia, who embraced me warmly. "Where have you been?" he asked. Next, he asked a very important question: "What can we do?"

I gave the ambassador a short list of items that could be changed in the draft Habitat Agenda that would strengthen rather than weaken the family&#039;s central role. Just 36 hours later, the heads of the Arab delegations in Istanbul issued a joint statement announcing to the entire Habitat conference that its members would not sign the Habitat Agenda unless (and until) certain important changes were made.

As a result, and at the insistence of the heads of the Arab delegations, several very important changes were made in the Habitat Agenda. Instead of defining&lt;i&gt;marriage&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;family&lt;/i&gt; in a manner that explicitly legitimated same-sex marriages and families (as did the original draft), the final Habitat Agenda defined the marital relationship as one between "husband and wife."&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Instead of numerous explicit paragraphs mandating worldwide abortion on demand, only one (somewhat hedged) reference to "reproductive health" remained.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; The Habitat Agenda, finally, formally recognized the family as "the basic unit of society" that "should be strengthened."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

These developments, viewed from the perspective of current American and European legal trends, are significant. The Habitat conference sent a strong message that strengthening the family - not the simple recognition of more "rights" or the creation of additional substitute social units - is the answer to many of our modern problems.

This message, of course, is obvious. The family &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the basic unit of society and &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be strengthened. But the fact that this message is obvious has not prevented us from ignoring it. During the past 50 years, American and other societies have been much more preoccupied with the individual and the individual&#039;s rights, and, indeed, with the creation of wealth, than with protection of the basic social unit within which individuals survive and thrive. The consequences are now becoming apparent around the globe.

Justice Georg Fr. Rieber-Mohn, a member of Norway&#039;s Supreme Court, recently gave an address at the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University that traced the close connection between the decline of the family and the decline of society. Because the justice&#039;s remarks vividly captured many of the root causes of modern social decline, I will quote from his remarks.

Justice Rieber-Mohn began by noting that at the conclusion of World War II, Norway (along with other Scandinavian countries) set out to create the ultimate "bonum commune" or "good society." According to the justice, Norway had a very good start. As he stated:

&lt;i&gt;If one looks back on Norway&#039;s near postwar period - the 1950s - we had a homogeneous and stable society. The Labour Party had a clear majority in the Parliament, we had full employment and a slowly rising prosperity in the wide stratum of the population. A modern welfare state with increasingly better social security was beginning to take form. . . . Criminality was under control, the police and the courts were soundly entrusted, mother was at home taking care of her children, and marriages usually lasted a lifetime through.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

By the conclusion of the 1950s, the justice recounted that poverty was virtually eradicated, medical care was extended to all, and education essentially became universal. Did Norway, therefore, enter social nirvana? Not according to Justice Rieber-Mohn:

&lt;i&gt;From around 1965 to around 1995 the criminality in Scandinavia has more than quintupled. . . . In this thirty-year perspective, displacements have also appeared on the criminal front. Thefts and burglaries played an even more predominant role in the beginning of the period. Violence has later increased in dimension, even though thefts are still dominant. It is also my impression that within individual crime categories there has been a transition towards a steadily harder criminality. Violence is more brutal than previously. More often it is unprovoked, affecting completely innocent and coincidental victims, and, increasingly with use of knives and firearms. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But it is not only the development of crime that agitates in this period. Also a series of other alarming tendencies increased. . . . From 1970 to 1988 the frequency of suicides in Norway doubled. . . . And if we look at the divorce frequency, it has quadrupled from 1960 until 1990. . . .&lt;/i&gt; [Moreover,] &lt;i&gt;thirty-nine percent of the children born in Norway in 1995 were from informal cohabitations. It is undoubtedly known that this type of relationship is less stable than ordinary marriages.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

Justice Rieber-Mohn, of course, describes Norwegian society, but parallels with the rest of the world are obvious. I don&#039;t have the statistics on the United States, but I believe that we can track similar trends. Indeed, the justice himself noted that this "dismal development in Scandinavia is maybe just a pale shimmer of much worse signs in the development in the United States."&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; As residents of the United States, we can affirm that Norway&#039;s "pale shimmer" is indeed an intense reality in America at the turn of the millennium.

What explains the abrupt negative developments noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn? The justice suggested at least two possible answers. The first involves the failure of a social theory. The second, and more fundamental answer, however, involves the failure of a social institution.

The first cause of Norway&#039;s modern difficulties, according to the justice, is the basic failure of "the classic Marxistic analysis and understanding of society that was so popular until just a few years ago."&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; I might question whether it was only popular until a few years ago. I think it may be growing in popularity as we speak. According to the justice, "If one removes poverty, social differences, unemployment, and social insecurity, one does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; at the same time remove criminality, anguish, mental agony, and malice among people."&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Material comfort, in sum, does not guarantee a decent, stable civilization. Poverty, insecurity, and the lack of education - and, indeed, the lack of individual rights - are social ills that must be battled, but their elimination will not secure an equitable society. As the Savior succinctly put it, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).

The second cause for the decline of modern Norwegian society noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn involves the breakdown of the Norwegian family. It is a breakdown being repeated in far too many societies around the world today:

&lt;i&gt;There can be no doubt that the contact between parents, and especially between mother and child, has been substantially reduced in our society in the course of a thirty-year period. In short, it has been expressed like this: "Mothers left the homes, and the fathers did not come home." . . .&lt;/i&gt; [W]&lt;i&gt;omen left the home in the course of a few years. The time was right. I find it difficult to not see that many homes made a sacrifice for this. They sacrificed time - that is undisputable. But they also sacrificed nearness, security, love, and procurement of values from adults to children.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

The brunt of the breakdown of the modern family has been born by those least able to bear it: our children. As Justice Rieber-Mohn noted:

&lt;i&gt;Children were to a great extent entrusted more or less to improvised solutions before kindergarten facilities gradually became better. But common for these solutions, also kindergartens, is that parents transfer the responsibility for major parts of a child&#039;s upbringing to a larger extent to people whose values and function as models they know very little about. Most people in Norway will be very unwilling to loan their new car to a relatively unknown person, at least over any length of time. But one loans one&#039;s children to strangers for month after month and year after year, already from their second year of life. One is anxious for damages on the car, but one closes one&#039;s eyes to possible unfortunate influence on children - unless it concerns something as drastic as violence from a childminder or sexual abuse in a kindergarten.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

What, if anything, can be done to halt the trends noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn? A definitive answer is well beyond the ken of a simple law professor from Utah. Nevertheless, I offer a few initial suggestions.

First of all, we must live "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). Three and one-half years ago, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a proclamation to the world regarding the centrality and importance of the family unit. The fundamental truths taught in that proclamation must become a central part of our social discourse. A valiant, worldwide struggle for individual rights over the past 50 years has led many to assume (or at least presume) that autonomy is the fullest reality anyone can hope to achieve. But our collective faith in this modern chimera ignores the homely reality that, as the poet said, "no man is an island."&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; We exist and find ultimate fulfillment only as members of communities. No community is more important - more central - to who we are, what we can be, and what we should be than the family.

Let me become a little personal and depart from my text for a minute at this point to bear you my testimony about the importance of the Church&#039;s proclamation on the family. I was a bishop in Orem when that document was issued at Women&#039;s Conference in September 1995, as I recall. I remember attending that meeting and hearing it read by President Hinckley. My reaction at the time may have been the same reaction that many of you might have had. It was a nice document. It stated things that I believed in, truths that I understood and felt to be true, but I thought it was just a nice statement. I didn&#039;t expect that it would do much, and frankly, at the time, I was rather convinced that the world was on a tack where the world wouldn&#039;t listen. This was a proclamation to the world. In fact, I remember thinking as I drove home from the meeting, and my firm conviction at the time was, that the world not only wouldn&#039;t listen but perhaps couldn&#039;t listen.

In Istanbul I had an opportunity to speak about the proclamation to people who didn&#039;t even know they were hearing the words of a modern prophet. As a result of a four-minute speech that encapsulated a few of the ideas in that proclamation, I saw some amazing things happen. I have since described them as the legal equivalent to the parting of the Red Sea, and it was close to that kind of an event.

As I concluded that conference in Istanbul, I had the privilege of hiking to a mosque in Istanbul, the Suleymaniye. There I saw many of my Moslem brothers and sisters praying on a rug that my guide explained to me represented the tree of life. The tree at the bottom of the rug was in tight bud, but at the top where they placed their hands to pray, the tree was bearing white fruit. The guide explained that if we attained life in the presence of Allah, we would be in his presence and would be able to eat of the fruit of what he called the tree of life. At that moment I had a profound spiritual witness that we are indeed children of the same God. We are all children of the same Heavenly Father. He loves us, and he speaks to all of us through a modern prophet. I felt a kinship with my brothers and sisters there in that mosque that day that has changed my life. I bear you my witness that the proclamation on the family to the world is indeed the word of God to this generation and to the entire world at this time. Because of that fact, I&#039;ll go to my second point.

Second, we must be willing to engage in social discourse about the family even if the discourse (at times) becomes difficult. We have just concluded a very difficult meeting in New York involving the five-year review of the Conference on Population and Development. Things didn&#039;t go as well as we&#039;d hoped. There wasn&#039;t a miraculous parting of the Red Sea this time. There were some things that happened at this conference that, perhaps, were somewhat negative. Nevertheless, people listened, and seeds were planted. There have been changes made. When I look back at the difference between the way people are listening to the principles taught in the proclamation now, as opposed to three years ago when this whole project began, I&#039;m dumbfounded. I will never forget the U.N. ambassador who asked me, "Where have you been?" The answer at the time was, "Home in Provo, Utah, minding my own business."

In fact, I wasn&#039;t just minding my own business; I was busy writing law review articles, moaning and groaning about how bad things were and that they were only going to get worse. I found out in Istanbul that I didn&#039;t just have to moan and groan. I could stand on my feet, pull up my socks, take a deep breath, exhibit a little courage, and speak out the truth of modern prophets. The time has come for all who care about reversing the trends described by Justice Rieber-Mohn to make their presence known in the public square.

The first draft of the Habitat Agenda provided numerous prescriptions (and proscriptions) that would have significantly altered family life - including the very definition of &lt;i&gt;spouse.&lt;/i&gt; The outcome at Istanbul would have been quite different if profamily advocates had stayed home. I daresay the outcome even at this last somewhat disappointing meeting in New York would have been different if profamily advocates had stayed home. There needs to be more than one voice on these issues. The world has heard one voice for an extended period.

From the 14th to the 17th of November 1999, the World Family Policy Center from Brigham Young University (formerly known as NGO Family Voice) will host (together with the Howard Center of Chicago, Illinois) the Second World Congress of Families in Geneva, Switzerland. The congress will bring together leading scholars, governmental officials, diplomats, and religious leaders from around the world to discuss strengthening the family "as the fundamental unit of society." In fact, I just received this morning from my fax machine a letter of confirmation from the Vatican that Cardinal Trujillo - the head of the Pontifical Council on the Family and head of the Congregation of the Faith, the most important of the three congregations within the Vatican - will be attending this congress as an official representative of the Catholic Church. As part of that effort, A Call from the Families of the World has been drafted by a prestigious international, interfaith community. Copies of the call have been placed in the lobby of this auditorium and are also available in 45 different languages at my office in the Law School. The call is also posted on the World Wide Web at www.worldcongress.org. I urge you to visit the Web site and learn more about the World Congress of Families. In particular, I urge you to read the call and sign it. The families of the world must make their voices heard.

Third, as we engage in social discourse about the family, it is time to thoughtfully (and prayerfully) reexamine the basics. According to Justice Rieber-Mohn, one of the basic causes for familial disintegration in Norway is mothers leaving the home. Although one answer (repeatedly given by modern prophets) is to encourage mothers to return home, this response may not be feasible in every situation. So how should families respond? This question will be difficult enough, but even more fundamental questions loom: Does marriage consist of a union between a man and a woman? If the answer to this question is "yes" (as the proclamation states), we have to answer the question with "why?" These questions must now be asked, and we must learn to give them answers. Thoughtful answers will help illuminate not only &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; roles families have traditionally played, but &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; society has valued the family and &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; that value can be perpetuated in the modern world.

Fourth, we should take all necessary steps to strengthen our own familial relationships. Although expert advice abounds and bookshelves groan on this subject, one of the best - and simplest - formulas for a successful family comes from an African-American scholar, Niara Sudarkasa. She has written that the Yoruba society from West Africa strove to inculcate "seven Rs" into family life: respect, responsibility, restraint, reciprocity, reverence, reason, and reconciliation.&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Families that teach (and evidence) these remarkable traits will provide essential strength, not only for family members but for society (and the world) at large.

Fifth, and finally, we must retain faith in a faithless world. However out of style, we must not forget that a quest for transcendence is essential to human success. A recent visit to Rome reacquainted me with some of the greatest art in the world - much of it directly inspired by religious faith. Great works, including great families, require commitment to something greater than ourselves. And that, in the end, may be the most valuable gift that we gain by defending our families. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

11. In the original draft, the Habitat Agenda stated that "[i]n different cultural, political and social systems, various forms of the family exist." This broad sentence, in the same paragraph that provided that all family forms are "entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support," would almost certainly have extended legal protection to same-sex marriages (Draft Habitat Agenda, par. 18). The final version of paragraph 18 now adds that, while "various forms of the family exist," "marriage" arises out of the "free consent of the intending spouses, and husband and wife should be equal partners" (Habitat Agenda, chapter 2, Goals and Principles, par. 18). Thus, "marriage" involves "spouses" who are "husband and wife."

12. The draft of the Habitat Agenda prior to debate in Istanbul contained more than 28 explicit references to abortion. All of these references were dropped and replaced with a single admonition that governments "should" (not "must," as in the earlier draft) "ensure universal access for women throughout their life span to a full range of affordable health care services, including those &lt;i&gt;related to&lt;/i&gt; reproductive health care" (Habitat Agenda, chapter 4, Global Plan of Action, par. 96[d][bis]; emphasis added).

The underlined words &lt;i&gt;related to&lt;/i&gt; were added to clarify that abortion was not &lt;i&gt;necessarily&lt;/i&gt; part of "reproductive health care." Prior to the Habitat Agenda, "reproductive health care" had been defined by the World Health Organization (a U.N. agency) as including the "interrupt[ion of] unwanted pregnancies." The "related to" language was designed to insure that "reproductive health care" did not automatically include the "interrupt[ion of] pregnancies."

			<p>Throughout history, stable societies have recognized (and protected) the family as the basic unit of society precisely because the family is the social unit that has the primary responsibility for rearing and educating children. The family has successfully performed these fundamental tasks, in large part, because peaceful existence within a secure family demands that family members recognize (and respect) not just "rights" but communal responsibilities. During the latter half of this century, however, a modern emphasis on autonomy has shifted the focus of academic and governmental energies away from the recognition of (and respect for) communal responsibilities to a focus on "individual rights."</p>
<p>An outstanding example is the United Nation&#8217;s Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention establishes previously unrecognized autonomy "rights" for children and interposes government between children and their parents to an unprecedented degree. The convention, in the words of Elder Bruce Hafen, goes a long way toward "abandoning children to their autonomy."<sup>1</sup> This abandonment of our children - and our families - continues apace. For example, in New York last week, my associate Kay (Kathryn Balmforth), who is another director of NGO Family Voice (also known as the World Family Policy Center), attended a preparatory meeting for the five-year review of the International Conference on Population and Development. There Kay watched for three days while the attendees of this important conference debated whether they would even include a reference to "parents" in a document that purportedly created a child&#8217;s right to sexual freedom, sexual training, and reproductive choice. At this important international meeting, it seemed that the mere mention of parental guidance on sexual matters was anathema.</p>
<p>The social consequences have been disastrous. In the words of Elder Hafen, because of the "emerging but misguided tendency among some adults to defer increasingly to children&#8217;s preferences," the modern world may well fail to encourage the "development of the personal competence needed to produce an ongoing democratic society comprised of persons capable of . . . responsible action."<sup>2</sup> It is time to appreciate (and correct) the consequences of the modern focus on autonomy and of disregard of the family. It is time to recognize and reemphasize the central role of the family community in creating and maintaining a stable society. It is time, in short, to direct some of the energy we have lavished on protection of the individual to the defense and protection of the family. Without this defense, the family, the most basic community of all, may be imperiled.</p>
<p>I first became involved with issues of family policy and society in June 1996, when, almost by accident, I attended a U.N. conference in Istanbul, Turkey. The conference, known as Habitat II,<sup>3</sup> was the culmination of a decade-long series of conferences designed to develop a "blueprint" for international (and ultimately domestic) legal relations during the coming century.<sup>4</sup> These conferences have been accurately perceived as significant international law-making events.<sup>5</sup> They have also followed a predictable (and extreme) ideological course primarily championed by a powerful lobby that, according to one scholar, "ha[s] marginalized parents, ignored the family, and denigrated cultural and religious values."<sup>6</sup> What made the Istanbul conference remarkable was that it departed from this set course.</p>
<p>As a result of an unusual series of events, I was selected to give a short four-minute speech before one of the drafting committees at the Habitat conference. The speakers who took the podium before me urged the conferees to recognize same-sex partnerships, increase funding for adolescent sexual reproductive services, provide 18 to 20 hours a day of government-sponsored day care, and take all "necessary steps" to insure that every woman was "fully employed" outside the home. Marriage and family, if noted at all by these speakers, were referenced primarily as institutions that reinforce odious cultural stereotypes and that subjugate and demean women. My message was rather different.</p>
<p>I began my remarks by informing the conferees that the family - as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other important U.N. documents - is the fundamental unit of society. It <i>is</i> the fundamental unit, moreover, precisely because it is the laboratory where little boys learn to love, respect, and work with little girls, and where little girls learn the same essential skills in dealing with little boys. I reminded the delegates that if we don&#8217;t learn these skills within the home, there is little chance that we will learn them elsewhere. Accordingly, I urged the delegates to do what they could to strengthen the family rather than expend the vast majority of their energies and time creating substitute social structures - or, perhaps even worse, creating legal structures to intervene in and disarrange the family.</p>
<p>I pointed out, for example, that extensive studies had shown that the incidence of teenage pregnancy and abortions actually <i>increases</i> following the initiation of "traditional" sex education programs that emphasize the teaching of technical sexual "know-how," including the use of prophylactics. By contrast, however, the incidence of adolescent pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted disease is dramatically reduced through family-based education programs.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of my short remarks, I emphasized the essential message of the First Presidency&#8217;s proclamation on the family<sup>7</sup>: that there is a "fundamental connection" between a decent society and "the reinforcement of strong, stable families."<sup>8</sup> The "traditional family," I reminded the delegates in Istanbul,</p>
<p><i>is the necessary foundation for . . . larger communities because it is the sanctuary where women and men learn cooperation, sacrifice, love, and mutual support; it is the training ground where children learn the public virtues of responsibility, work, fair play, and social interdependence.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>The basic structure of society, I asserted, "is built from the fundamental values fostered by strong families."<sup>10</sup> I concluded by urging the conferees to consider seriously the need to protect traditional values in drafting and implementing the Habitat Agenda.</p>
<p>The reaction to the speech was remarkable. Many of the speakers who had preceded me at the podium hissed as I returned to my seat. But most of the delegates in the audience gave me a standing ovation. Indeed, after the speech I was approached by the ambassador from Saudi Arabia, who embraced me warmly. "Where have you been?" he asked. Next, he asked a very important question: "What can we do?"</p>
<p>I gave the ambassador a short list of items that could be changed in the draft Habitat Agenda that would strengthen rather than weaken the family&#8217;s central role. Just 36 hours later, the heads of the Arab delegations in Istanbul issued a joint statement announcing to the entire Habitat conference that its members would not sign the Habitat Agenda unless (and until) certain important changes were made.</p>
<p>As a result, and at the insistence of the heads of the Arab delegations, several very important changes were made in the Habitat Agenda. Instead of defining<i>marriage</i> and/or <i>family</i> in a manner that explicitly legitimated same-sex marriages and families (as did the original draft), the final Habitat Agenda defined the marital relationship as one between "husband and wife."<sup>11</sup> Instead of numerous explicit paragraphs mandating worldwide abortion on demand, only one (somewhat hedged) reference to "reproductive health" remained.<sup>12</sup> The Habitat Agenda, finally, formally recognized the family as "the basic unit of society" that "should be strengthened."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>These developments, viewed from the perspective of current American and European legal trends, are significant. The Habitat conference sent a strong message that strengthening the family - not the simple recognition of more "rights" or the creation of additional substitute social units - is the answer to many of our modern problems.</p>
<p>This message, of course, is obvious. The family <i>is</i> the basic unit of society and <i>must</i> be strengthened. But the fact that this message is obvious has not prevented us from ignoring it. During the past 50 years, American and other societies have been much more preoccupied with the individual and the individual&#8217;s rights, and, indeed, with the creation of wealth, than with protection of the basic social unit within which individuals survive and thrive. The consequences are now becoming apparent around the globe.</p>
<p>Justice Georg Fr. Rieber-Mohn, a member of Norway&#8217;s Supreme Court, recently gave an address at the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University that traced the close connection between the decline of the family and the decline of society. Because the justice&#8217;s remarks vividly captured many of the root causes of modern social decline, I will quote from his remarks.</p>
<p>Justice Rieber-Mohn began by noting that at the conclusion of World War II, Norway (along with other Scandinavian countries) set out to create the ultimate "bonum commune" or "good society." According to the justice, Norway had a very good start. As he stated:</p>
<p><i>If one looks back on Norway&#8217;s near postwar period - the 1950s - we had a homogeneous and stable society. The Labour Party had a clear majority in the Parliament, we had full employment and a slowly rising prosperity in the wide stratum of the population. A modern welfare state with increasingly better social security was beginning to take form. . . . Criminality was under control, the police and the courts were soundly entrusted, mother was at home taking care of her children, and marriages usually lasted a lifetime through.</i><sup>14</sup></p>
<p>By the conclusion of the 1950s, the justice recounted that poverty was virtually eradicated, medical care was extended to all, and education essentially became universal. Did Norway, therefore, enter social nirvana? Not according to Justice Rieber-Mohn:</p>
<p><i>From around 1965 to around 1995 the criminality in Scandinavia has more than quintupled. . . . In this thirty-year perspective, displacements have also appeared on the criminal front. Thefts and burglaries played an even more predominant role in the beginning of the period. Violence has later increased in dimension, even though thefts are still dominant. It is also my impression that within individual crime categories there has been a transition towards a steadily harder criminality. Violence is more brutal than previously. More often it is unprovoked, affecting completely innocent and coincidental victims, and, increasingly with use of knives and firearms. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>But it is not only the development of crime that agitates in this period. Also a series of other alarming tendencies increased. . . . From 1970 to 1988 the frequency of suicides in Norway doubled. . . . And if we look at the divorce frequency, it has quadrupled from 1960 until 1990. . . .</i> [Moreover,] <i>thirty-nine percent of the children born in Norway in 1995 were from informal cohabitations. It is undoubtedly known that this type of relationship is less stable than ordinary marriages.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Justice Rieber-Mohn, of course, describes Norwegian society, but parallels with the rest of the world are obvious. I don&#8217;t have the statistics on the United States, but I believe that we can track similar trends. Indeed, the justice himself noted that this "dismal development in Scandinavia is maybe just a pale shimmer of much worse signs in the development in the United States."<sup>16</sup> As residents of the United States, we can affirm that Norway&#8217;s "pale shimmer" is indeed an intense reality in America at the turn of the millennium.</p>
<p>What explains the abrupt negative developments noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn? The justice suggested at least two possible answers. The first involves the failure of a social theory. The second, and more fundamental answer, however, involves the failure of a social institution.</p>
<p>The first cause of Norway&#8217;s modern difficulties, according to the justice, is the basic failure of "the classic Marxistic analysis and understanding of society that was so popular until just a few years ago."<sup>17</sup> I might question whether it was only popular until a few years ago. I think it may be growing in popularity as we speak. According to the justice, "If one removes poverty, social differences, unemployment, and social insecurity, one does <i>not</i> at the same time remove criminality, anguish, mental agony, and malice among people."<sup>18</sup> Material comfort, in sum, does not guarantee a decent, stable civilization. Poverty, insecurity, and the lack of education - and, indeed, the lack of individual rights - are social ills that must be battled, but their elimination will not secure an equitable society. As the Savior succinctly put it, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).</p>
<p>The second cause for the decline of modern Norwegian society noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn involves the breakdown of the Norwegian family. It is a breakdown being repeated in far too many societies around the world today:</p>
<p><i>There can be no doubt that the contact between parents, and especially between mother and child, has been substantially reduced in our society in the course of a thirty-year period. In short, it has been expressed like this: "Mothers left the homes, and the fathers did not come home." . . .</i> [W]<i>omen left the home in the course of a few years. The time was right. I find it difficult to not see that many homes made a sacrifice for this. They sacrificed time - that is undisputable. But they also sacrificed nearness, security, love, and procurement of values from adults to children.</i><sup>19</sup></p>
<p>The brunt of the breakdown of the modern family has been born by those least able to bear it: our children. As Justice Rieber-Mohn noted:</p>
<p><i>Children were to a great extent entrusted more or less to improvised solutions before kindergarten facilities gradually became better. But common for these solutions, also kindergartens, is that parents transfer the responsibility for major parts of a child&#8217;s upbringing to a larger extent to people whose values and function as models they know very little about. Most people in Norway will be very unwilling to loan their new car to a relatively unknown person, at least over any length of time. But one loans one&#8217;s children to strangers for month after month and year after year, already from their second year of life. One is anxious for damages on the car, but one closes one&#8217;s eyes to possible unfortunate influence on children - unless it concerns something as drastic as violence from a childminder or sexual abuse in a kindergarten.</i><sup>20</sup></p>
<p>What, if anything, can be done to halt the trends noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn? A definitive answer is well beyond the ken of a simple law professor from Utah. Nevertheless, I offer a few initial suggestions.</p>
<p>First of all, we must live "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). Three and one-half years ago, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a proclamation to the world regarding the centrality and importance of the family unit. The fundamental truths taught in that proclamation must become a central part of our social discourse. A valiant, worldwide struggle for individual rights over the past 50 years has led many to assume (or at least presume) that autonomy is the fullest reality anyone can hope to achieve. But our collective faith in this modern chimera ignores the homely reality that, as the poet said, "no man is an island."<sup>21</sup> We exist and find ultimate fulfillment only as members of communities. No community is more important - more central - to who we are, what we can be, and what we should be than the family.</p>
<p>Let me become a little personal and depart from my text for a minute at this point to bear you my testimony about the importance of the Church&#8217;s proclamation on the family. I was a bishop in Orem when that document was issued at Women&#8217;s Conference in September 1995, as I recall. I remember attending that meeting and hearing it read by President Hinckley. My reaction at the time may have been the same reaction that many of you might have had. It was a nice document. It stated things that I believed in, truths that I understood and felt to be true, but I thought it was just a nice statement. I didn&#8217;t expect that it would do much, and frankly, at the time, I was rather convinced that the world was on a tack where the world wouldn&#8217;t listen. This was a proclamation to the world. In fact, I remember thinking as I drove home from the meeting, and my firm conviction at the time was, that the world not only wouldn&#8217;t listen but perhaps couldn&#8217;t listen.</p>
<p>In Istanbul I had an opportunity to speak about the proclamation to people who didn&#8217;t even know they were hearing the words of a modern prophet. As a result of a four-minute speech that encapsulated a few of the ideas in that proclamation, I saw some amazing things happen. I have since described them as the legal equivalent to the parting of the Red Sea, and it was close to that kind of an event.</p>
<p>As I concluded that conference in Istanbul, I had the privilege of hiking to a mosque in Istanbul, the Suleymaniye. There I saw many of my Moslem brothers and sisters praying on a rug that my guide explained to me represented the tree of life. The tree at the bottom of the rug was in tight bud, but at the top where they placed their hands to pray, the tree was bearing white fruit. The guide explained that if we attained life in the presence of Allah, we would be in his presence and would be able to eat of the fruit of what he called the tree of life. At that moment I had a profound spiritual witness that we are indeed children of the same God. We are all children of the same Heavenly Father. He loves us, and he speaks to all of us through a modern prophet. I felt a kinship with my brothers and sisters there in that mosque that day that has changed my life. I bear you my witness that the proclamation on the family to the world is indeed the word of God to this generation and to the entire world at this time. Because of that fact, I&#8217;ll go to my second point.</p>
<p>Second, we must be willing to engage in social discourse about the family even if the discourse (at times) becomes difficult. We have just concluded a very difficult meeting in New York involving the five-year review of the Conference on Population and Development. Things didn&#8217;t go as well as we&#8217;d hoped. There wasn&#8217;t a miraculous parting of the Red Sea this time. There were some things that happened at this conference that, perhaps, were somewhat negative. Nevertheless, people listened, and seeds were planted. There have been changes made. When I look back at the difference between the way people are listening to the principles taught in the proclamation now, as opposed to three years ago when this whole project began, I&#8217;m dumbfounded. I will never forget the U.N. ambassador who asked me, "Where have you been?" The answer at the time was, "Home in Provo, Utah, minding my own business."</p>
<p>In fact, I wasn&#8217;t just minding my own business; I was busy writing law review articles, moaning and groaning about how bad things were and that they were only going to get worse. I found out in Istanbul that I didn&#8217;t just have to moan and groan. I could stand on my feet, pull up my socks, take a deep breath, exhibit a little courage, and speak out the truth of modern prophets. The time has come for all who care about reversing the trends described by Justice Rieber-Mohn to make their presence known in the public square.</p>
<p>The first draft of the Habitat Agenda provided numerous prescriptions (and proscriptions) that would have significantly altered family life - including the very definition of <i>spouse.</i> The outcome at Istanbul would have been quite different if profamily advocates had stayed home. I daresay the outcome even at this last somewhat disappointing meeting in New York would have been different if profamily advocates had stayed home. There needs to be more than one voice on these issues. The world has heard one voice for an extended period.</p>
<p>From the 14th to the 17th of November 1999, the World Family Policy Center from Brigham Young University (formerly known as NGO Family Voice) will host (together with the Howard Center of Chicago, Illinois) the Second World Congress of Families in Geneva, Switzerland. The congress will bring together leading scholars, governmental officials, diplomats, and religious leaders from around the world to discuss strengthening the family "as the fundamental unit of society." In fact, I just received this morning from my fax machine a letter of confirmation from the Vatican that Cardinal Trujillo - the head of the Pontifical Council on the Family and head of the Congregation of the Faith, the most important of the three congregations within the Vatican - will be attending this congress as an official representative of the Catholic Church. As part of that effort, A Call from the Families of the World has been drafted by a prestigious international, interfaith community. Copies of the call have been placed in the lobby of this auditorium and are also available in 45 different languages at my office in the Law School. The call is also posted on the World Wide Web at www.worldcongress.org. I urge you to visit the Web site and learn more about the World Congress of Families. In particular, I urge you to read the call and sign it. The families of the world must make their voices heard.</p>
<p>Third, as we engage in social discourse about the family, it is time to thoughtfully (and prayerfully) reexamine the basics. According to Justice Rieber-Mohn, one of the basic causes for familial disintegration in Norway is mothers leaving the home. Although one answer (repeatedly given by modern prophets) is to encourage mothers to return home, this response may not be feasible in every situation. So how should families respond? This question will be difficult enough, but even more fundamental questions loom: Does marriage consist of a union between a man and a woman? If the answer to this question is "yes" (as the proclamation states), we have to answer the question with "why?" These questions must now be asked, and we must learn to give them answers. Thoughtful answers will help illuminate not only <i>what</i> roles families have traditionally played, but <i>why</i> society has valued the family and <i>how</i> that value can be perpetuated in the modern world.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should take all necessary steps to strengthen our own familial relationships. Although expert advice abounds and bookshelves groan on this subject, one of the best - and simplest - formulas for a successful family comes from an African-American scholar, Niara Sudarkasa. She has written that the Yoruba society from West Africa strove to inculcate "seven Rs" into family life: respect, responsibility, restraint, reciprocity, reverence, reason, and reconciliation.<sup>22</sup>Families that teach (and evidence) these remarkable traits will provide essential strength, not only for family members but for society (and the world) at large.</p>
<p>Fifth, and finally, we must retain faith in a faithless world. However out of style, we must not forget that a quest for transcendence is essential to human success. A recent visit to Rome reacquainted me with some of the greatest art in the world - much of it directly inspired by religious faith. Great works, including great families, require commitment to something greater than ourselves. And that, in the end, may be the most valuable gift that we gain by defending our families. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>11. In the original draft, the Habitat Agenda stated that "[i]n different cultural, political and social systems, various forms of the family exist." This broad sentence, in the same paragraph that provided that all family forms are "entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support," would almost certainly have extended legal protection to same-sex marriages (Draft Habitat Agenda, par. 18). The final version of paragraph 18 now adds that, while "various forms of the family exist," "marriage" arises out of the "free consent of the intending spouses, and husband and wife should be equal partners" (Habitat Agenda, chapter 2, Goals and Principles, par. 18). Thus, "marriage" involves "spouses" who are "husband and wife."</p>
<p>12. The draft of the Habitat Agenda prior to debate in Istanbul contained more than 28 explicit references to abortion. All of these references were dropped and replaced with a single admonition that governments "should" (not "must," as in the earlier draft) "ensure universal access for women throughout their life span to a full range of affordable health care services, including those <i>related to</i> reproductive health care" (Habitat Agenda, chapter 4, Global Plan of Action, par. 96[d][bis]; emphasis added).</p>
<p>The underlined words <i>related to</i> were added to clarify that abortion was not <i>necessarily</i> part of "reproductive health care." Prior to the Habitat Agenda, "reproductive health care" had been defined by the World Health Organization (a U.N. agency) as including the "interrupt[ion of] unwanted pregnancies." The "related to" language was designed to insure that "reproductive health care" did not automatically include the "interrupt[ion of] pregnancies."</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am going to tell you two stories today: a short one about dead cats and a long one about dead people.
Dead Cats
First, dead cats. Now, I know you might be tired of so many talks beginning with stories about dead cats, but bear with me.
My parents views on pets - cats or otherwise - could not have been more different. My mother grew up in a household that didnt allow animals in the house; my dad grew up in a home where pets, at one point even including a monkey, were allowed inside. Over their sixty-some-odd years of marriage, my parents struck a bit of a compromise about pets in our home. Smaller cage-bound animals such as hamsters, snakes, frogs, toads, and fish were allowed inside, but larger animals such as cats, dogs, and any animal destined to become dinner stayed in the garage, the doghouse, or the chicken coop. Dogs were confined, but cats were free to roam. Well, they were free to roam as long as I didnt pick them up and dress them in my dolls clothing - a fate most of them contemplated with a mixture of trepidation and resignation.
When I was very young, we lived on a busy intersection with constant traffic. The combination of this location and the pet policy meant that cats - and there seemed to be an endless parade of them that somehow ended up at our house - rarely died of old age. I liked the cats and mourned their loss, and at some point I began to memorize the names and faces of all the cats who had lived, loved, and then shuffled off their mortal coils at our house. Eventually I was unable to keep all of the memories and names straight, and, concerned, I asked my mom whether all those cats would meet us in heaven and whether they would recognize us and we them. She assured me that they would - that the cats would remember me and I them. Forever.
Now, the impact of that story isnt so much about the cats, but it is about my mothers assurances that relationships last, much like photographs of the two of us have lasted far beyond the moments they captured. Relationships are durable and meaningful - even beyond death. This idea was central to my childhood. As the youngest of nine children, I arrived after three of my four grandparents, a handful of cousins, and my brother had died. Knowing that death would not forever prevent me from knowing those people was deeply comforting and grounding.
In a way, that early understanding about relationships has shaped my professional pursuits. I have spent my entire adult life studying relationships, particularly family relationships, and the power they have - for good or ill - to shape social, economic, religious, political, material, and emotional possibilities and realities. My research focuses mostly on eighteenth-century England. This means I study dead people and what they can teach us. As Thomas W. Laqueur put </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Let me begin by telling you a little about myself. In the process I will share with you my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ as well as the three key ingredients we need to ensure happiness and peace in this life and give us a taste of what life will be like in our heavenly home.
I grew up in the Queens borough of New York City. New York City is a wonderful place that is full of excitement and entertainment. As a youth I was heavily involved with rap music, and my brother and I belonged to a rap group called CBS. No, it was not the television station. The acronym CBS stood for Cant Be Stopped. We thought the name was cool.
We traveled throughout the city performing at wedding receptions, high school dances, and block parties. During the summer months different rap groups would visit the neighborhood park to perform free concerts. Most of the youth involved with rap visited the parks to listen and, at times, compete with the other rap groups. Often, however, these free concerts attracted drug deals and promoted random violence.
It was during the summer of my 14th year that a random violent event occurred - which I will not go into - that provided me an opportunity to leave New York City and changed the course of my life forever.
During that time I was fortunate that my mother decided to send the family money and invited all of the children to come live with her in Hawaii. The money came at the right time, and that week I purchased a one-way ticket to Hawaii.
When I arrived in Hawaii, I quickly recognized its many differences from New York City - the oceans clear blue water and the fresh cool breeze at night. I also recognized the many different nationalities and cultures. After my first day of attending Mililani High School, I came home and told my mother that it had felt like I was representing Africa at a United Nations meeting.
During the first few weeks of high school, the basketball coach noticed that I was one of the tallest young men on campus, and he invited me to try out for the basketball team. While living in New York I had not played much basketball. I enjoyed baseball and was on the bowling team, but I had never played on a basketball team. I believe it was because of my height that I started on the varsity team as a sophomore.
We won three basketball games that year, and everyone in the community was excited because it was three more games than the team had won the year before. In my junior year we won six games, and by the time I was a senior we had won 14 games and we became the Western Division champions, which advanced us to the Hawaii state play-offs. Because of my successful senior year, I was recruited to play basketball for BYUHawaii. All I knew about BYUHawaii was that it was a church school similar to Notre Dame or a St. Marys University.
At the start of the fall semester I was instructed by my academic adv</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I love the Book of Mormon! I first read it from cover to cover the summer I turned 13. There was a lot I didnt understand, but I remember distinctly that I did not enjoy the descriptions about the wars. Since then I have read the book many times. Usually I have skimmed the parts about the wars, especially the lengthy section in the last 20 chapters of Alma. I have wondered, "Why does someone like me need to know all this detail about the wars between the Lamanites and Nephites?"
This past year as I taught Sunday School to the 16- and 17-year-olds, we came once again to Mormons account of these fierce wars. This time when I studied, I came across Mormons Map by BYU professor emeritus John Sorenson and decided to follow Mormons descriptions of the geography of the wars.1 As I did so, I noticed several important patterns:
First, the battles were between people who were either for or against the kingdom of God.
Second, the enemy attacked the edges before the main center of Zarahemla was finally captured.
Third, the attacks were unrelenting over a period of time.
Fourth, dissenters from within the Nephites were most effective in helping the enemies succeed.
Fifth, and finally, the attacks initially gave the Nephites a cause, but eventually they lost sight of their goals.
Why did Mormon include this long history of warfare at this important time just before the Saviors birth and subsequent appearance on the American continent? I believe one reason is to help us recognize the "war" we are waging today - once again just before the coming of the Savior. When the invitation was extended to speak at a devotional, I knew exactly what I wanted to talk about.
Today I would like to talk about the war we are waging to defend our homes. Our social fabric has been attacked around the edges, and now it is moving to the center - our homes! Ill use Moronis strategies of preparing places of security to suggest ways to protect our homes and renew our powers today. But before we talk about how we will defend our homes, I would first like to describe the battle as I see it and what I mean by home.
The War We Are Waging
How are our homes and families being attacked at the edges? We are experiencing unprecedented prosperity and access to information, travel, and communication. In most ways these advances are blessings, and we surely would not want to return to the way people used to experience everyday life. An example of the home-front battles that were fought in the early days of the Church is found in Ann Howell Burts journal. Sister Burt emigrated from Wales, married, and lived in a dugout in the summer of 1863. As a young mother she had to work hard to keep order and see to the needs of her family. She recorded in her journal:
For several mornings I was puzzled to find my milk-pan skimmed. . . . So the other evening I sat</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you on this special occasion. I am sorry that Sister Nelson has a cold and a cough that has kept her at home. I am overwhelmed by this large congregation of young adults. Many more are gathered throughout North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the isles of the sea. I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to be with us. Since these proceedings are being translated into 28 languages, we also pray for our translators.
To each young adult I bring greetings and love from President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Thomas S. Monson, President James E. Faust, and my Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We thank you for your faith, your devotion, and your desire to serve the Lord. We love each one of you.
I would like you to stop taking notes, just for a moment, and do some personal soul-searching. Tonight you are eager and young. Most of you are students with great ambitions for the future. Now I want you to think. I want you to think about yourself, not as you are, but as you may become - 50 years from now. Through your imaginary time tunnel, look at yourself as you will be then. Your broad minds and narrow waists have traded places. You are finished with your career. Your working days are over - no more time clocks to punch or paychecks to collect. Are you with me?
Now, here are my questions: What do you see in yourself 50 years from now? What do you want to be 50 years from now? What do you really want, most of all, 50 years from now?
I think I can hear your minds working. Some of you might say, "I just want to be alive 50 years from now." Not a bad idea. Accidents and illnesses are part of mortality, which means that some of you wont be here 50 years from now. But most of you will. So plan for the rule, not the exception. Some of you see fame or fortune in your future. And most of you want families.
If Sister Nelson were here, I would invite her to stand beside me. As you know, man is not without the woman in the Lord.1 Perhaps our being together could help you in your planning and achieving what you want to become. The title of my message tonight is "Faith and Families." Purposely, I have listed faith first. That has always been the lodestar for our married life: to have faith to seek first the kingdom of God. We have learned that unshakable faith in the Lord enriches married life and love. Faith in Him increases ones very capacity to love, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
More than 50 years ago we were young adults, as you are now. This photograph was taken at that time. We were both university students. [A photograph of them as a young couple was shown.] I was a sophomore premedical student; she was a freshman on a scholarship. We were very much in love. I think you can sense that in the photo. Brethren, you cant blame me for being in love with her, can you?</span>
