  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Today is literally one of the highlights of my life. My soul is filled with joy and thanksgiving. From the time I was a little boy, the opening day of school has always been one of excitement and anticipation. It is for this reason that a high point of my years as president of BYU has been the opportunity for Janet and me to share some thoughts with you at the beginning of each fall semester.

This one, of course - for reasons Brother Hafen has explained - is also laden with an extra element of emotion. It is our seventh September devotional, and we realize that it will be our last. I have appreciated more than words can tell the expressions of support, loyalty, and love that I have received from you, and I want you to know how deeply Janet and I care for each of you and the great hopes that we have for your success and happiness not only during your time here at BYU, but also throughout this life and the next.

It is for this reason that I have pondered and prayed long over what message I want to leave with you on this very special day, my last devotional at the beginning of a new school year. There are so many hopes I have for each of you. I want you to be well educated, in the fullest sense of that word. I want you to be learned in the wisdom of the world. I want your education to help you to be happier and give you a fuller understanding of the awesome significance of what it means that in these last days the Father and the Son have actually come here to this earth and personally chosen a prophet through whom the great prophecies of Daniel and Peter have come to pass and through whom a restitution of all things is possible.

We could discuss so many things as a consequence of these grand truths. I have chosen one topic, and I hope it will be helpful to you. The principle of living that I want to discuss with you today can carry anyone of several possible labels. A very popular one, and a good one, is &lt;i&gt;ethics. &lt;/i&gt;Another is &lt;i&gt;honesty. &lt;/i&gt;Frankly, the one that I slightly prefer is &lt;i&gt;integrity &lt;/i&gt;because for me it includes not only the values implicit in the other two, but also reminds us that what we are striving for is a wholeness and completeness of all that is good. As President Kimball has taught us: "Integrity is one of the cornerstones of character. . . . [It] is a state or quality of being complete, undivided, or unbroken" (&lt;i&gt;TSWK, &lt;/i&gt;p. 192).

Whatever we call it, the quality we are talking about is easier to illustrate than it is to label or to define, and both negative as well as affirmative illustrations are available. At the negative end is the classic statement of Leona Helmsley that "only little people pay taxes" or Ivan Boeskys equally insightful counsel to UCLA business students in 1986 that "greed is a good thing" or Leo Durochers well-known observation that "nice guys finish last."

There is a &lt;i&gt;Peanuts &lt;/i&gt;cartoon in which Charlie Brown first shot the arrow and then drew the bulls-eye and the rest of the supporting target around his arrow. When Lucy complained that that was not the way it was supposed to be done, Charlie Brown responded, "If you do it my way, you never miss!"

Let me give you an example at the opposite end of the spectrum. It involves a boyhood hero of mine, Ted Williams, one of the greatest baseball players of all time. A. Thomas Young, president and chief operating officer of Martin Marietta Corporation, who observed that "ethics will continue to be the issue of the 90s," reports Williams experience as follows:

&lt;i&gt;More than 30 years ago, Ted Williams was closing out his career with the Boston Red Sox. He was suffering from a pinched nerve in his neck that season.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"The thing was so bad," he later explained, "that I could hardly turn my head to look at the pitcher. "&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the first time in his career he batted under .300, hitting just .254 with 10 home runs. He was the highest salaried player in sports, making $125,000. The next year, the Red Sox sent him the same contract.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When he got the contract, Williams sent it back with a note saying that he would not sign it until they gave him the full pay &lt;/i&gt;cut &lt;i&gt;allowed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;I was always treated fairly by the Red Sox when it came to contracts," Williams said. "Now they were offering me a contract I didnt deserve. And I only wanted what I deserved."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Williams cut his own salary by 25 percent, raised his batting average by 62 points and closed out a brilliant career by hitting a home run in his final at bat. &lt;/i&gt;[A. Thomas Young, "Ethics in Business," &lt;i&gt;Vital Speeches of the Day, &lt;/i&gt;15 September 1992, pp. 72526; emphasis in original]

Wallace F. Smith, a Berkeley business school professor, defines ethics as "the inherent inner voice, the source of self-control in the absence of external pressure or compulsion" ("Readers Report," &lt;i&gt;Business Week, &lt;/i&gt;4 May 1992, p. 11).

This Ted Williams story is, I submit, the classic illustration. This great hero did what he did because he was exercising "self-control in the absence of external pressure or compulsion." My own favorite definition comes from Potter Stewart, an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. He defines ethics as "knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do."

Justice Stewart is also one of my heroes and was one of historys finest justices and lawyers. I hope that throughout your lives you will remember and ponder his advice about the distinction between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do. You have a legal right, for example, to gossip, lie (unless you do it under oath), cut corners across BYU grass, burn flags, read pornography, be disrespectful to your parents, criticize and attack your Church leaders, apostatize from the Church, pay less than a full tithing, smoke cigarettes, be insensitive to your family members needs, sit by silently doing nothing while your neighbor drowns - all the while writing a poem called "Ode to a Drowning Man" - or wear a red sweater in Cougar stadium the afternoon of November 18, when the Cougars play the University of Utah. But the fact that you have a right to do these things does not make any of them the right thing to do, and ethics, as defined by Justice Stewart, consists of knowing the difference between the two.

One of the most important observations to make about ethics or integrity or whatever we call it is the danger of over-compartmentalization, that is, treating ethical issues as something separate and apart from other aspects of what we do. A law student reported, for example, that when she raised a question in one of her first-year classes whether a certain practice might be ethical, the professor responded, "You will take your ethics course next year." When I read this law professors response, it reminded me of Elder Neal A. Maxwells insightful observation that:

&lt;i&gt;Developing congruency and avoiding the compartmentalization of ones life is, of course, necessary for the wholeness and integrity we all crave, but which is so elusive at times. So many of us have a "public self" and a "private self." Jesus made it crystal clear that outer appearances and inner feelings must, ultimately, coincide. If the teachings of the gospel about honesty make for an honest tithe but wash against an attitudinal wall in terms of business practices, honesty is being applied differentially. We are saying that "honesty is the best policy - part of the time!"&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;"A More Excellent Way" &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), pp. 126127]

One of the best tests of whether we are or are not compartmentalizing our lives, I submit, is whether we would be willing to give our pet parrot to the town gossip.

I also like Elder Bruce R. McConkies explanation that these principles of ethics, which are so universally accepted, and properly so, are grounded in more than common sense and respect for others. In his words:

&lt;i&gt;In teaching the gospel, it is far less effective to say "Be honest, for honesty is the best policy," and then to reason from a social standpoint why this is so, than to link honesty with the gospel out of which it grows by teaching: "Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell." (2 Nephi 9:34.) It is only when gospel ethics are tied to gospel doctrines that they rest on a sure and enduring foundation and gain full operation in the lives of the saints.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;A New Witness for the Articles of Faith &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 700]

I believe that one of the most important indicators of how honest we are is the seriousness with which we keep agreements that we have made. One of the most sobering problems facing our society today, in my opinion, is the failure of so many people simply to do what they have agreed to do. It is becoming quite commonplace, for example, not only for professional athletes but also for others to insist on "renegotiating" their contracts because they conclude that they are now in a position to make a better deal than the one to which they earlier committed themselves.

A bit more subtle perhaps, but certainly just as important, are our obligations to organizations and institutions to which we belong, and with whom we have made certain commitments, either expressly or by virtue of our membership or affiliation.

One of the institutions - and the people who compose it - to whom we have an integrity obligation is the nation of which we are citizens. In the case of most of us, that country is the United States of America. For me, the most consistently dismaying lack of individual integrity in this respect is the failure of rather large numbers of American citizens to pay their income taxes. Equally dismaying are the reasons given by some of these people. The two most common are that the income tax is either unconstitutional or (in the case of some LDS Church members) inconsistent with gospel principles. Each of these positions is absurd. Concerning constitutionality, the income tax is explicitly authorized by the Constitution itself. The Sixteenth Amendment states, in words that could not be more plain: "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes." I have spent a good part of my life arguing and litigating over what is and is not constitutional. But I have never understood how any rational human being can take the position that a part of the Constitution itself is unconstitutional. And the notion that the anti-income tax position is rooted in gospel principles is equally insupportable in light of President Harold B. Lees statement describing as "vicious and wicked" the practice of those "who are taking the law into their own hands by refusing to pay their income tax because they have some political disagreement with constituted authorities" ("Admonitions for the Priesthood of God," &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;January 1973, pp. 105, 106).

Another opportunity to demonstrate our institutional integrity is provided by our membership in the BYU community, whose Honor Code is one of our distinguishing features. Some people are fond of pointing out, and very correctly so, that some aspects of our Honor Code are founded on principles of fundamental morality and integrity that would apply to any member of the Church and any ethical person regardless of affiliation or nonaffiliation with BYU - or for that matter with the Church. Examples are those principles dealing with observing the criminal laws of the land, academic honesty, and sexual morality. But it does not follow that we have a two-tiered Honor Code, the first tier consisting of those values that are to be taken seriously, and whose violation should be a matter for some kind of official university response, whereas those in the second tier, most notably our Dress and Grooming Standards, fall into a category of admonitions that we might call good ideas if youre into that kind of thing, but since theyre not required for a temple recommend, dont sweat it.

What this two-tiered approach ignores, of course, is that there is another overarching principle at work, not applicable to members of the Church in general. It has to do with keeping the deals we have made, precisely the kind of thing that we have been talking about this morning. Members of the Church at large have not signed a formal commitment in the presence of their bishop to keep all aspects of the Honor Code, with solemn assurances that the applicants are serious about the commitments they have made and will honor them.

The fact that you and I have made such a commitment should be the end of the matter. Having made such a formal promise, we are bound by it just as Karl G. Maeser was bound by the hypothetical lines of his famous circle. Thats what we mean by honor, and thats what we mean by integrity. A different standard does apply to those of us at BYU, a standard that has been determined very consciously by our board of trustees, and which each of us has solemnly agreed to follow. I hope that no one on this campus will ever adopt a two-tiered approach to the Honor Code, observing those provisions that in the individuals view are important and disregarding the others. They are all important precisely because we have agreed to honor them.

In conclusion, let me tell you about one of our alumni who met the full measure of honesty. He is a retired gentleman, living on a modest pension, who sat in my office a few years ago and told me that in the 1930s he had attended BYU for one quarter. Due to some administrative error, he had never been billed for the $32 that at that time, according to his recollection, was the amount BYU charged for a quarters tuition. He told me, "For over 50 years that unpaid tuition has weighed heavily on my mind, and I want to make it right. You tell me what I owe, and I will pay." I told him that he owed us absolutely nothing. The statute of limitations on that claim had run a half century ago. He patiently pointed out that he was not talking about a legal obligation but a moral one.

When I could see that nothing less than satisfaction of my estimate of the present value of that original $32 obligation would calm his soul, I told him that I thought a reasonable present value for the unpaid tuition of years ago would be about $500. He thought about my answer for a minute and then said, "Could I have a little time to pay it off?" We worked out a payment schedule, and that obligation has now been completely satisfied.

I refer back to Elder McConkies observation that for a believing, practicing Latter-day Saint, we are honest and ethical not only because it is the best policy but also because it is solidly tied to the principles of restored truth. Everything we do should be guided by restored truth, by our conviction that once again prophets walk upon the earth, and we have the benefit, both through modern scripture and through their teachings, of the will of our Heavenly Father. Its not just another Church. Joseph Smith really did see the Father and the Son, the priesthood is once again on the earth, and the Book of Mormon is exactly what it purports to be, a new witness for Christ received by revelation and translated under the direct inspiration of our Heavenly Father. We must first secure our knowledge of these truths, and they will then become the foundation for everything else we do. That honesty and integrity in all things and with respect to all persons and institutions may be one of the results of that conviction is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Today is literally one of the highlights of my life. My soul is filled with joy and thanksgiving. From the time I was a little boy, the opening day of school has always been one of excitement and anticipation. It is for this reason that a high point of my years as president of BYU has been the opportunity for Janet and me to share some thoughts with you at the beginning of each fall semester.</p>
<p>This one, of course - for reasons Brother Hafen has explained - is also laden with an extra element of emotion. It is our seventh September devotional, and we realize that it will be our last. I have appreciated more than words can tell the expressions of support, loyalty, and love that I have received from you, and I want you to know how deeply Janet and I care for each of you and the great hopes that we have for your success and happiness not only during your time here at BYU, but also throughout this life and the next.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I have pondered and prayed long over what message I want to leave with you on this very special day, my last devotional at the beginning of a new school year. There are so many hopes I have for each of you. I want you to be well educated, in the fullest sense of that word. I want you to be learned in the wisdom of the world. I want your education to help you to be happier and give you a fuller understanding of the awesome significance of what it means that in these last days the Father and the Son have actually come here to this earth and personally chosen a prophet through whom the great prophecies of Daniel and Peter have come to pass and through whom a restitution of all things is possible.</p>
<p>We could discuss so many things as a consequence of these grand truths. I have chosen one topic, and I hope it will be helpful to you. The principle of living that I want to discuss with you today can carry anyone of several possible labels. A very popular one, and a good one, is <i>ethics. </i>Another is <i>honesty. </i>Frankly, the one that I slightly prefer is <i>integrity </i>because for me it includes not only the values implicit in the other two, but also reminds us that what we are striving for is a wholeness and completeness of all that is good. As President Kimball has taught us: "Integrity is one of the cornerstones of character. . . . [It] is a state or quality of being complete, undivided, or unbroken" (<i>TSWK, </i>p. 192).</p>
<p>Whatever we call it, the quality we are talking about is easier to illustrate than it is to label or to define, and both negative as well as affirmative illustrations are available. At the negative end is the classic statement of Leona Helmsley that "only little people pay taxes" or Ivan Boeskys equally insightful counsel to UCLA business students in 1986 that "greed is a good thing" or Leo Durochers well-known observation that "nice guys finish last."</p>
<p>There is a <i>Peanuts </i>cartoon in which Charlie Brown first shot the arrow and then drew the bulls-eye and the rest of the supporting target around his arrow. When Lucy complained that that was not the way it was supposed to be done, Charlie Brown responded, "If you do it my way, you never miss!"</p>
<p>Let me give you an example at the opposite end of the spectrum. It involves a boyhood hero of mine, Ted Williams, one of the greatest baseball players of all time. A. Thomas Young, president and chief operating officer of Martin Marietta Corporation, who observed that "ethics will continue to be the issue of the 90s," reports Williams experience as follows:</p>
<p><i>More than 30 years ago, Ted Williams was closing out his career with the Boston Red Sox. He was suffering from a pinched nerve in his neck that season.</i></p>
<p><i>"The thing was so bad," he later explained, "that I could hardly turn my head to look at the pitcher. "</i></p>
<p><i>For the first time in his career he batted under .300, hitting just .254 with 10 home runs. He was the highest salaried player in sports, making $125,000. The next year, the Red Sox sent him the same contract.</i></p>
<p><i>When he got the contract, Williams sent it back with a note saying that he would not sign it until they gave him the full pay </i>cut <i>allowed.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;I was always treated fairly by the Red Sox when it came to contracts," Williams said. "Now they were offering me a contract I didnt deserve. And I only wanted what I deserved."</i></p>
<p><i>Williams cut his own salary by 25 percent, raised his batting average by 62 points and closed out a brilliant career by hitting a home run in his final at bat. </i>[A. Thomas Young, "Ethics in Business," <i>Vital Speeches of the Day, </i>15 September 1992, pp. 72526; emphasis in original]</p>
<p>Wallace F. Smith, a Berkeley business school professor, defines ethics as "the inherent inner voice, the source of self-control in the absence of external pressure or compulsion" ("Readers Report," <i>Business Week, </i>4 May 1992, p. 11).</p>
<p>This Ted Williams story is, I submit, the classic illustration. This great hero did what he did because he was exercising "self-control in the absence of external pressure or compulsion." My own favorite definition comes from Potter Stewart, an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. He defines ethics as "knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do."</p>
<p>Justice Stewart is also one of my heroes and was one of historys finest justices and lawyers. I hope that throughout your lives you will remember and ponder his advice about the distinction between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do. You have a legal right, for example, to gossip, lie (unless you do it under oath), cut corners across BYU grass, burn flags, read pornography, be disrespectful to your parents, criticize and attack your Church leaders, apostatize from the Church, pay less than a full tithing, smoke cigarettes, be insensitive to your family members needs, sit by silently doing nothing while your neighbor drowns - all the while writing a poem called "Ode to a Drowning Man" - or wear a red sweater in Cougar stadium the afternoon of November 18, when the Cougars play the University of Utah. But the fact that you have a right to do these things does not make any of them the right thing to do, and ethics, as defined by Justice Stewart, consists of knowing the difference between the two.</p>
<p>One of the most important observations to make about ethics or integrity or whatever we call it is the danger of over-compartmentalization, that is, treating ethical issues as something separate and apart from other aspects of what we do. A law student reported, for example, that when she raised a question in one of her first-year classes whether a certain practice might be ethical, the professor responded, "You will take your ethics course next year." When I read this law professors response, it reminded me of Elder Neal A. Maxwells insightful observation that:</p>
<p><i>Developing congruency and avoiding the compartmentalization of ones life is, of course, necessary for the wholeness and integrity we all crave, but which is so elusive at times. So many of us have a "public self" and a "private self." Jesus made it crystal clear that outer appearances and inner feelings must, ultimately, coincide. If the teachings of the gospel about honesty make for an honest tithe but wash against an attitudinal wall in terms of business practices, honesty is being applied differentially. We are saying that "honesty is the best policy - part of the time!"</i> [<i>"A More Excellent Way" </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), pp. 126127]</p>
<p>One of the best tests of whether we are or are not compartmentalizing our lives, I submit, is whether we would be willing to give our pet parrot to the town gossip.</p>
<p>I also like Elder Bruce R. McConkies explanation that these principles of ethics, which are so universally accepted, and properly so, are grounded in more than common sense and respect for others. In his words:</p>
<p><i>In teaching the gospel, it is far less effective to say "Be honest, for honesty is the best policy," and then to reason from a social standpoint why this is so, than to link honesty with the gospel out of which it grows by teaching: "Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell." (2 Nephi 9:34.) It is only when gospel ethics are tied to gospel doctrines that they rest on a sure and enduring foundation and gain full operation in the lives of the saints.</i> [<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 700]</p>
<p>I believe that one of the most important indicators of how honest we are is the seriousness with which we keep agreements that we have made. One of the most sobering problems facing our society today, in my opinion, is the failure of so many people simply to do what they have agreed to do. It is becoming quite commonplace, for example, not only for professional athletes but also for others to insist on "renegotiating" their contracts because they conclude that they are now in a position to make a better deal than the one to which they earlier committed themselves.</p>
<p>A bit more subtle perhaps, but certainly just as important, are our obligations to organizations and institutions to which we belong, and with whom we have made certain commitments, either expressly or by virtue of our membership or affiliation.</p>
<p>One of the institutions - and the people who compose it - to whom we have an integrity obligation is the nation of which we are citizens. In the case of most of us, that country is the United States of America. For me, the most consistently dismaying lack of individual integrity in this respect is the failure of rather large numbers of American citizens to pay their income taxes. Equally dismaying are the reasons given by some of these people. The two most common are that the income tax is either unconstitutional or (in the case of some LDS Church members) inconsistent with gospel principles. Each of these positions is absurd. Concerning constitutionality, the income tax is explicitly authorized by the Constitution itself. The Sixteenth Amendment states, in words that could not be more plain: "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes." I have spent a good part of my life arguing and litigating over what is and is not constitutional. But I have never understood how any rational human being can take the position that a part of the Constitution itself is unconstitutional. And the notion that the anti-income tax position is rooted in gospel principles is equally insupportable in light of President Harold B. Lees statement describing as "vicious and wicked" the practice of those "who are taking the law into their own hands by refusing to pay their income tax because they have some political disagreement with constituted authorities" ("Admonitions for the Priesthood of God," <i>Ensign, </i>January 1973, pp. 105, 106).</p>
<p>Another opportunity to demonstrate our institutional integrity is provided by our membership in the BYU community, whose Honor Code is one of our distinguishing features. Some people are fond of pointing out, and very correctly so, that some aspects of our Honor Code are founded on principles of fundamental morality and integrity that would apply to any member of the Church and any ethical person regardless of affiliation or nonaffiliation with BYU - or for that matter with the Church. Examples are those principles dealing with observing the criminal laws of the land, academic honesty, and sexual morality. But it does not follow that we have a two-tiered Honor Code, the first tier consisting of those values that are to be taken seriously, and whose violation should be a matter for some kind of official university response, whereas those in the second tier, most notably our Dress and Grooming Standards, fall into a category of admonitions that we might call good ideas if youre into that kind of thing, but since theyre not required for a temple recommend, dont sweat it.</p>
<p>What this two-tiered approach ignores, of course, is that there is another overarching principle at work, not applicable to members of the Church in general. It has to do with keeping the deals we have made, precisely the kind of thing that we have been talking about this morning. Members of the Church at large have not signed a formal commitment in the presence of their bishop to keep all aspects of the Honor Code, with solemn assurances that the applicants are serious about the commitments they have made and will honor them.</p>
<p>The fact that you and I have made such a commitment should be the end of the matter. Having made such a formal promise, we are bound by it just as Karl G. Maeser was bound by the hypothetical lines of his famous circle. Thats what we mean by honor, and thats what we mean by integrity. A different standard does apply to those of us at BYU, a standard that has been determined very consciously by our board of trustees, and which each of us has solemnly agreed to follow. I hope that no one on this campus will ever adopt a two-tiered approach to the Honor Code, observing those provisions that in the individuals view are important and disregarding the others. They are all important precisely because we have agreed to honor them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me tell you about one of our alumni who met the full measure of honesty. He is a retired gentleman, living on a modest pension, who sat in my office a few years ago and told me that in the 1930s he had attended BYU for one quarter. Due to some administrative error, he had never been billed for the $32 that at that time, according to his recollection, was the amount BYU charged for a quarters tuition. He told me, "For over 50 years that unpaid tuition has weighed heavily on my mind, and I want to make it right. You tell me what I owe, and I will pay." I told him that he owed us absolutely nothing. The statute of limitations on that claim had run a half century ago. He patiently pointed out that he was not talking about a legal obligation but a moral one.</p>
<p>When I could see that nothing less than satisfaction of my estimate of the present value of that original $32 obligation would calm his soul, I told him that I thought a reasonable present value for the unpaid tuition of years ago would be about $500. He thought about my answer for a minute and then said, "Could I have a little time to pay it off?" We worked out a payment schedule, and that obligation has now been completely satisfied.</p>
<p>I refer back to Elder McConkies observation that for a believing, practicing Latter-day Saint, we are honest and ethical not only because it is the best policy but also because it is solidly tied to the principles of restored truth. Everything we do should be guided by restored truth, by our conviction that once again prophets walk upon the earth, and we have the benefit, both through modern scripture and through their teachings, of the will of our Heavenly Father. Its not just another Church. Joseph Smith really did see the Father and the Son, the priesthood is once again on the earth, and the Book of Mormon is exactly what it purports to be, a new witness for Christ received by revelation and translated under the direct inspiration of our Heavenly Father. We must first secure our knowledge of these truths, and they will then become the foundation for everything else we do. That honesty and integrity in all things and with respect to all persons and institutions may be one of the results of that conviction is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I bring you the love and blessing of President Thomas S. Monson and the First Presidency of the Church. President Monson asked me specifically to share his love and greeting with you. Just over an hour ago I left a meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve. They also asked that I extend to you their love and blessing.
I want to mention the great respect and appreciation the leaders of the Church feel for President and Sister Samuelson. President Samuelson was called from a very prominent and financially rewarding medical and healthcare profession to become a General Authority seventeen years ago. The service of this wonderful couple reflects the unselfishness and devotion of disciples of Christ. We love you, President and Sister Samuelson.
BYU is a very special place. The Lords influence is upon this school. For a young man or woman desiring a university education, it is an oasis of righteousness. For a young disciple of Christ, BYU offers an extraordinary environment for learning, for meeting others, for making important decisions, and for growing spiritually. BYUs prophetic direction, its history, its faculty and administration, and its students make it what it is. You help make BYU what it is. We love you for who you are.
BYU holds a special importance for our family. Kathy and I met here, and we both graduated from BYU. Our four children also graduated from BYU, and three of our four met their eternal companions here.
When I fell in love with Kathy, I wondered how an insecure Idaho farm boy could attract a beautiful, intelligent woman from Florida. I then remembered one talent I possessed: I had served my mission in France, and I spoke French. I had been told that young women loved to hear French spoken to them. But, to my dismay, I realized I did not know the French words of romance. I only knew missionary words. I won Kathys heart with ma cherie at the front, je taime at the end, and the plan of salvation in between.
As a sidenote, let me encourage you young women to have the courage to let an insecure but interesting young man know that you would like to know him better. Take a risk! I remember coming home to my roommates and incredulously saying, "I think she actually likes me. Can you believe it? She likes me!" It does a lot for the initiative of an insecure man.
While attending BYU, I remember hearing frequent references to BYUs first president, Karl G. Maeser. President Brigham Young instructed Dr. Maeser that he "ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."1 I would like to acknowledge BYUs most impressive faculty. To attract the intelligence, preparation, and spiritual maturity of those who teach here is a miracle itself. How fortunate we are to have this faculty.
I come to you today under assignment by the First Presidency. I have thought and prayed much about what the Lord would h</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, you have done it again. This is the 10th year that you have done so, and I congratulate you most warmly. I speak of the Princeton Review rankings, where you have come in first out of 366 colleges. You are the most "stone-cold sober" student body in America.
How proud you ought to feel about this designation - no smoking, no drinking, no drugs. You are living up to the Honor Code of this institution. You will be blessed for doing so.
Why would anyone on this campus, where education is heavily subsidized by the Church, have any desire to do anything less?
It is a remarkable thing that on any given Sunday this magnificent physical plant becomes a vast Church campus. Thousands of young people, scriptures in hand, are to be seen hurrying to classrooms and lecture halls that become places of religious instruction. I do not know where else in all this world there is a similar thing of such magnitude.
Now, yesterdays Wall Street Journal published the rankings of university business schools, and BYU came in number one in the regional rankings among all the business schools of America (see "Recruiters Top Schools," Journal Report on Business Schools: The Recruiters Picks [special section], Wall Street Journal, 17 September 2007, R5).
What a unique institution this is. Coupled with its associates in Hawaii and Idaho, it is a leader both academically and spiritually. How fortunate you are in the opportunity to attend here. Many others wish to come here but are unable to do so.
The magnificent physical plant, together with a great faculty, makes it an academic jewel. But the end product of all of this, of course, is you - you thousands of aspiring young scholars.
I agree that it is a grinding experience to earn a degree here. But the result is something of which you can be extremely proud.
The by-product of your academic achievement will be a bundle of ethical, moral, and spiritual values. These are summarized in our thirteenth article of faith: "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" (Articles of Faith 1:13).
This is a short and simple statement, but its implications are enormous.
We believe in being honest.
We cannot cheat. We cannot do anything of a dishonest nature. We make a pledge with ourselves to be scrupulously honest in all that we do. This is not always easy.
In matters of honesty, there are no shortcuts - no little white lies or big black lies. There is only the simple, honest truth spoken in total candor. And I think there is nothing more honest than good, hard work.
I recently read a book titled No Shortcuts to the Top. It is the story of Ed Viesturs. Ed has climbed Mount Everest six times and has reached the summits of the worlds highest mountains without the use of supplemental oxygen. When asked how he did it, h</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear young friends, I speak to you as one who stands on the edge of eternity. From that perspective, I see you as the choicest spirits ever placed on the earth. The promises in your generations patriarchal blessings, if you are faithful, seem to exceed the promises in Sister Fausts blessing and in mine. You know better than I the challenges of living in the world today. The "Teenagers Bill of Rights" declares: "Please support us by believing in us rather than fearing for us" (Lia Gay, Jamie Yellin, and others, in Jack Canfield, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul: 101 Stories of Life, Love and Learning [Deerfield Beach, Florida: Health Communications, 1997], p. 307). I want you to know that I believe in you. I believe you can be in the world but not of the world.
The Devils Throat
In the world there are many things of value to discover and much more to live for and hope for; however, as you move forward, you should be careful not to get too close to the Devils Throat. As a young man I served a mission to Brazil. It was a marvelous experience. I have returned many times since then in my Church assignments. One of the wonders of the world in that great country is Iguacu Falls. In the flood season, the volume of water spilling over the brink is the largest in the world. Every few minutes, millions of gallons of water cascade into the chasm below. One part of the falls, where the deluge is the heaviest, is called the Devils Throat. Large rocks are situated just before the water rushes down into the Devils Throat. Some of the braver Brazilians used to take passengers in canoes to stand on those rocks and look down into the Devils Throat. The water above the falls is usually calm and slow-moving and the atmosphere tranquil. Except for the roar of the water below, there was no way to anticipate the danger that lay just a few feet beyond. A sudden, unexpected current could have taken the canoe into the rushing waters, over the cliff, and down into the Devils Throat. While standing on a rock, a loss of footing or vertigo would have the same effect.
Spiritually, a Devils Throat is concealed beneath the deceptively calm tranquility of our lives and the world in which we live. Each of you has to have the strength and integrity not to get too close to the Devils Throat. Bravado in the face of certain death, physical or spiritual, is foolhardy.
At this time in your lives you sometimes challenge things, such as parents authority, society, values, religion. When I was a lawyer I had a client who was a very successful contractor. But he challenged things. For instance, he argued that the earth is flat. I really think he knew it is round, but he would challenge it. By that time in my life I had traveled around the world. In World War II, I was assigned over a period of time to go west from San Francisco to Cairo and West Africa, and later to Brazil, and then home. But I knew th</span>
