  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a joy for me to be here and also to be mindful of those young people joining us for the first time since their graduation from high school. The message today is going to be one of a testimony of prophets and why we should listen to a prophet’s voice. Yesterday the drive by the cortege to Whitney, Idaho, was a touching tribute to a prophet of God.

There was a tribute by members of the Church as they lined the highway and stood on the overpasses along the road. Some were dressed in their Sunday best on a Saturday afternoon. Others paused in respect, stopping their cars and standing reverently, waiting for the prophet to pass. Farmers stood in their fields with their hats over their hearts. Probably more significant were the young boys taking their baseball hats off and putting them over their hearts. Flags waved good-bye as the prophet went by as well. There were signs that read, “We love President Benson.” Others said, “Read the Book of Mormon.”

As we spontaneously sang “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet” at the closing of the graveside service in Whitney, the beautiful refrain bore record of the privilege we have to be led by prophets in these latter days. I’d like to read the words:

&lt;i&gt;We thank thee, O God, for a prophet&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To guide us in these latter days.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We thank thee for sending the gospel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To lighten our minds with its rays.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We thank thee for every blessing &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Bestowed by thy bounteous hand.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We feel it a pleasure to serve thee,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And love to obey thy command.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When dark clouds of trouble hang o’er us&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And threaten our peace to destroy,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There is hope smiling brightly before us,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And we know that deliv’rance is nigh.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We doubt not the Lord nor his goodness.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We’ve proved him in days that are past.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The wicked who fight against Zion&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Will surely be smitten at last.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We’ll sing of his goodness and mercy.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We’ll praise him by day and by night,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rejoice in his glorious gospel,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And bask in its life-giving light.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thus on to eternal perfection&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The honest and faithful will go,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;While they who reject this glad message&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Shall never such happiness know.&lt;/i&gt;
[“We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet,” &lt;i&gt;Hymns, &lt;/i&gt;1985, no. 19]

With the passing of President Benson, our prophet, on Monday, May 30, at 2:35 p.m., the events that have transpired have presented me with solemn, spiritual experiences and personal participation as a witness in sacred priesthood governance.

When the president of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved, and the counselors take their place in seniority of calling in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Quorum of the Twelve then presides over the Church until the First Presidency is reorganized. The president of the Quorum of the Twelve is automatically the presiding officer of the Church when there is no First Presidency.

On Tuesday morning, May 31, the Quorum of the Twelve met with President Hunter presiding as the senior member of the Quorum. It was a beautiful meeting with honor and testimony given in brotherhood for the loving memories of President Benson.

On Thursday morning all the General Authorities who were in Salt Lake City attended a fast and testimony meeting in the temple in honor of President Benson. The testimonies were rich in expressions of love and gratitude for the teachings and example of President Benson’s life of service. It was interesting that each one of us had been touched in our lives as we had served with him.

Thursday evening we had the opportunity of bringing our families to pay homage to our dear departed prophet at the Church Administration Building, where President Benson lay in state. My choicest experience was an opportunity of being able to bear testimony to my children and grandchildren of prophets in these latter days.

Friday, for twelve hours, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., thousands of devoted members of the Church and citizens of the community paid their respect as they filed by President Benson’s casket in the rotunda of the Church Office Building. I took some time to observe those who came. The love and devotion they expressed for President Benson as they reverently waited and filed slowly past was touching. Many expressed to one another in hushed tones their personal witness of the prophet’s goodness.

Saturday’s funeral services expressed a rich outpouring of the Spirit being manifest in honor of one of the great servants in this dispensation. The Quorum of the Twelve and the seven Presidents of Seventy served as honor guard as the casket entered and departed the Tabernacle.

After the funeral the honor guard drove as a cortege to Whitney, Idaho, to participate in the graveside service. President Benson’s loving son dedicated the grave site. President Benson was then placed to rest beside his beloved Flora—reunited with his companion of sixty-five years.

It was an eventful week, one I shall never forget because of the spiritual experiences that strengthened my testimony of the truthfulness of this great work.

A solemn assembly will be held during October conference. Each of us will have the opportunity to sustain the officers of the Church. President John Taylor taught us regarding the sustaining of officers:

&lt;i&gt;We hold up our right hand when voting in token before God that we will sustain those for whom we vote. . . . For when we lift up our hands in this way, it is in token to God that we are sincere in what we do, and that we will sustain the parties we vote for. . . . If we agree to do a thing and do not do it, we become covenant breakers and violators of our obligations, which are, perhaps, as solemn and binding as anything we can enter into. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 21:207]

A sustaining vote is a public commitment of our own willingness to be obedient and to consecrate our lives to furthering the work of the Lord. The sustaining of officers is called &lt;i&gt;the law of common consent. &lt;/i&gt;Sustaining is a principle of agency. Church officers are chosen by the spirit of revelation resting upon those priesthood holders set apart to call and ordain.

Sustaining is the public affirmation of our acceptance of priesthood authority as stated in the fifth article of faith:

&lt;i&gt;We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.&lt;/i&gt; [Articles of Faith 1:5]

Yes, this has been a historic week for the Church. The passing of President Benson marks the end of an era. How appropriate that the death of our patriot prophet came on Memorial Day, when we honor those who served our nation defending our constitutional freedoms.

President Benson devoted his life to testifying about Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. Here are my personal remembrances of President Benson:

First was his ability to sincerely communicate one-on-one directly with each of us who served with him. He would sit at his desk. I would be seated just to his right in a chair facing his large swivel chair. He would sit there with his large from-plowboy-to-prophet hands, our knees almost touching, and look me directly in the eyes with a depth of inner feeling that touched my very soul and tell me what was important for me to know or to do in my life or calling. When I left his office there was no doubt in my mind that I had been instructed by a prophet of the Lord.

Second, President Benson was fearless in the cause of truth and right. He was a living example of the words of the hymn “Do what is right; let the consequence follow” (&lt;i&gt;Hymns, &lt;/i&gt;1985, no. 237). God bless his memory.

On one occasion in Europe I remember kneeling in prayer beside President Benson when we were at the point of selecting a stake president. What a great joy to participate with him in prayer and understand the true order of prayer and what it means to be able to call upon the Lord for revelation.

Apostles of all ages have had the character traits of courage and fearlessness. President Howard W. Hunter demonstrated his courage at this very pulpit. When faced by a terrorist threat to read a statement to which President Hunter could not agree, President Hunter calmly said, “No, I can’t read that statement”—even though his assailant stood next to him, threatening him with what he said was an explosive device. Would that each of us would have the courage to say no when we are faced with making choices that we know are not right.

Another example of President Hunter’s courage and determination to complete a task given him by the First Presidency is demonstrated by the completion of the Jerusalem Center. President Hunter purchased the land, supervised the architecture and construction of the center, and negotiated with government and religious leaders the teaching objectives for the center. During the years it took to complete the Jerusalem Center, President Hunter demonstrated a steadfastness and courage against opposition. He told those who worked with him, “Go ahead, move forward. Don’t take counsel from your fears.” How often we don’t even try, and we fail simply because of our fear of failure.

Thirty years ago President Hunter bore testimony that we should turn to the prophets of this dispensation for counsel and direction in our lives. He said,

&lt;i&gt;To peoples of past dispensations and ages, the most important prophet was the one then living, teaching, and revealing the will of the Lord in their time. In each of the past dispensations, prophets have been raised up by the Lord as his spokesmen to the people of that particular age and for the specific problems of that age.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It is the present living prophet who is our leader, our teacher. It is from him we take direction in the modern world. From all corners of the earth, we who sustain him as a prophet of the Lord, express our appreciation for this source of divine guidance. We are grateful for his life, his example, his teachings, his leadership. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As the prophets from the beginning to the present day pass in review before our memory, we become aware of the great blessing which comes to us from the influence of a living prophet. History should teach us that unless we are willing to heed the warnings and follow the teachings of a prophet of the Lord, we will be subject to the judgments of God&lt;/i&gt;. [&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;October 1963, p. 101]

President Hunter’s miracle recoveries from death’s door have been a testimony to all of us that the Lord has a mission for him to fulfill.

President Hunter, like President Kimball and President Benson, met adversity with a spirit of quiet, resolute determination that has strengthened and blessed all who have been close to them.

The testimonies of the Savior given by prophets are eloquent and bold in challenging each of us to bear witness. President Hunter has been an example to me since I have been in the Quorum. Here is one great testimony he gave:

&lt;i&gt;Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, pupil of Aristotle, conqueror of most of the known world in his time, was one of the world’s great young leaders. After years of exercising military pomp and prowess and after extending his kingdom from Macedonia to Egypt and from Cyprus to India, he wept when there seemed to be no more world to conquer. Then, as evidence of just how ephemeral such power is, Alexander caught a fever and died at thirty-three-years of age. The vast kingdom he had gained virtually died with him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Quite a different young leader also died at what seems such an untimely age of thirty-three. He likewise was a king, a pupil, and a conqueror. Yet he received no honors from man, achieved no territorial conquests, rose to no political station. So far as we know, he never held a sword nor wore even a single piece of armor. But the kingdom he established still flourishes some two thousand years later. His power was not of this world.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The differences between Alexander and this equally young Nazarene are many. But the greatest difference is in their ultimate victories. Alexander conquered lands, peoples, principalities, and earthly kingdoms. But he who is called the Perfect Leader, he who was and is the Light and Life of the world—Jesus Christ the Son of God—conquered what neither Alexander nor any other could defeat or overcome: Jesus of Nazareth conquered death. Against the medals and monuments of centuries of men’s fleeting victories stands the only monument necessary to mark the eternal triumph—an empty garden tomb. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;April 1986, pp. 17–18]

I give my testimony of the Savior and that empty tomb and what it means to us to be able to pray to the Savior when we have a problem and to be able to get an answer. President Hunter challenges us that we cannot secretly be a disciple:

&lt;i&gt;The world needs men who are willing to step forward and declare themselves. The world needs men who will lift the load of responsibility to their shoulders and carry it high under the banner of Jesus Christ—men who are willing to defend the right openly. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;How can men of conscience ignore the teachings of the Master in their daily affairs, in business, or in government? We stand by and wink at many things because we fear to do anything about them. We may be against crime . . . , but what do we do about it? We may be against corruption in government or against juvenile delinquency, but what do we do about it? We may have a belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ, but what are we doing about it? We need to push fear into the background and come forward with a definite, positive declaration, and assume responsibility. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Now is the time for those who have been noncommittal or who have had a halfhearted interest to come out boldly and declare belief in Christ and be willing to demonstrate faith by works. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;October 1960, pp. 108–9]

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us how to overcome fear, declare belief in Christ, and be willing to demonstrate faith by works, even by giving his very life.

This month, June 1994, marks 150 years since the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and his brother Hyrum Smith, the patriarch of the Church, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844.

Section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants was written by Elder John Taylor of the Council of the Twelve, who was a witness to the events of the Martyrdom. Joseph Smith prophetically and willingly gave his life to certify his testimony and faith in this great work.

&lt;i&gt;When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said: “I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer’s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL YET BE SAID OF ME—HE WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD.” &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 135:4]

The Prophet’s martyrdom was a voluntary acceptance of death at the hands of evil hirelings, “To seal the testimony of this book [the Doctrine and Covenants] and the Book of Mormon” (D&amp;amp;C 135:1) and to bear holy witness of Jesus Christ and his gospel in this dispensation. Christ himself was a martyr who, through his atoning sacrifice, voluntarily laid his life down; according to our Heavenly Father’s plan, that immortality and eternal life would become available to all who came to dwell on earth.

Jesus, too, prophesied of the events that were to happen in his life and went willingly, giving testimony of who he was:

&lt;i&gt;I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. &lt;/i&gt;[John 10:14–18]

For both the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., and our Savior Jesus Christ it can be said, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).

True religious martyrs are part of an eternal gospel plan and earn an eternal reward: “Whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name’s sake [and the gospel’s], shall find it again, even life eternal” (D&amp;amp;C 98:13; see also Mark 8:35). The pioneers who gave their lives in the westward trek are martyrs also, but not in the same way as the prophet who held the priesthood keys and willingly gave his life in testimony to seal his work in this dispensation. Brigham Young gave this teaching about the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith:

&lt;i&gt;For they killed the prophets . . . ; and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from the ground against them. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Many have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and the wicked might be condemned. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 136:36, 39]

Elder John Taylor writes of the “innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw” (D&amp;amp;C 135:7).

In Revelation 4 and 5 the apostle John records that a door was opened in heaven. He saw the Lord, Jesus Christ, seated on a throne with a book in his right hand and “a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book?” (Revelation 5:1–2).

John was told he was worthy to see the book. And when the Lord had opened the fifth seal, “I [John] saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held” (Revelation 6:9).

Throughout the teachings about the Martyrdom, testimony is one of the central themes. What was to become of the Church and the priesthood that the Prophet restored and of the Saints who believed in Joseph’s testimony? Elders Parley P. Pratt, Brigham Young, and most of the other members of the Quorum of the Twelve were on missions throughout the Eastern States. In Parley P. Pratt’s autobiography (&lt;i&gt;PPP, &lt;/i&gt;chapter 42, pp. 290–96), he writes of the mood of the day at the time: “A day or two previous to this circumstance [the Martyrdom] I had been constrained by the Spirit to start prematurely for home, without knowing why or wherefore.” Parley, with his companion and brother William Pratt, followed the prompting of the Spirit and booked passage on a canal boat from Utica, New York, to Buffalo, New York. Parley wrote,

&lt;i&gt;As we conversed together on the deck, a strange and solemn awe came over me, as if the powers of hell were let loose. I was so overwhelmed with sorrow I could hardly speak. . . . I . . . exclaimed—“Brother William, . . . let us observe an entire and solemn silence, for this is a dark day, and the hour of triumph for the powers of darkness.” &lt;/i&gt;[p. 292]

William and Parley then separated, and Parley took a steamer for Chicago.

&lt;i&gt;The steamer touched at a landing in Wisconsin, some fifty or sixty miles from Chicago, and here some new passengers came on board and brought the news of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Great excitement prevailed on board, there being a general spirit of exultation and triumph at this glorious news, as it was called. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Many passengers now gathered about me and tauntingly inquired what the Mormons would do now, seeing their Prophet and leader was killed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To these taunts and questions I replied, that they &lt;/i&gt;[the Mormons] &lt;i&gt;would continue their mission and spread the work he had restored, in all the world. Observing that nearly all the prophets and Apostles who were before him had been killed, and also the Saviour of the world, and yet their death did not alter the truth nor hinder its final triumph.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;At this reply many of them seemed astonished. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Landing in Chicago I found great excitement, and the press had issued extras announcing the triumph of the murderous mob in killing the Smiths. &lt;/i&gt;[pp. 292–93]

It took Parley two or three days to go to Peoria, Illinois. He then had a distance of 105 miles to go on foot to Nauvoo. He “walked along over the plains of Illinois, lonely and solitary,” and reflected on what he would find in Nauvoo. His thoughts turned to the grieving widows of the two martyrs:

&lt;i&gt;How shall I meet an entire community bowed down with grief and sorrow unutterable? What shall I say? . . . I walked onward, weighed down as it were unto death. When I could endure it no longer, I cried out aloud, saying: O Lord! in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Thee, show me what these things mean, and what I shall say to Thy people? On a sudden the Spirit of God came upon me, and filled my heart with joy and gladness indescribable. . . . The Spirit said unto me: “Lift up your head and rejoice; for behold! it is well with my servants Joseph and Hyrum. My servant Joseph still holds the keys of my kingdom in this dispensation, and he shall stand in due time on the earth, in the flesh, and fulfil that to which he is appointed. Go and say unto my people in Nauvoo, that they shall continue to pursue their daily duties and take care of themselves, and make no movement in Church government to reorganize or alter anything until the return of the remainder of the Quorum of the Twelve. But exhort them that they continue to build the House of the Lord which I have commanded them to build in Nauvoo.” &lt;/i&gt;[pp. 293–94]

Parley went on his way rejoicing and arrived in Nauvoo ready to spread his message to the people.

&lt;i&gt;In confirmation that the message was right, I found them already renewing their labors on the Temple, under the direction of John Taylor and Willard Richards, who were members of our quorum, and were in jail with the prophets when they were murdered—Taylor being wounded with four bullets, and Richards escaping uninjured.&lt;/i&gt;

Parley Pratt concludes this chapter with the following:

&lt;i&gt;President Brigham Young was unanimously chosen and upheld in the Presidency of the whole Church; the keys of which he held by virtue of his apostleship, being the senior and President of the highest quorum &lt;/i&gt;[the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles] &lt;i&gt;of the Church then living in the flesh. &lt;/i&gt;[p. 296]

In closing, may I remind each of us that we don’t give our testimony and lives in death in the manner that Joseph Smith, the martyred Prophet, gave his life because that was part of his mission. Rather, we give testimony by devoted service in our lives each day to lift and to strengthen others.

In the same manner that the people sorrowed at the death of Joseph Smith, we sorrow in this day for the loss of President Benson. But, also, I bear witness that in the same manner that Brigham Young led the Church after following a great prophet, our next prophet will do the same in our day. I give you my testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. This talk today has been a testimony of prophets and of the importance that we know of their divine calling as leaders in this dispensation. That each of us may be able to be obedient and follow the teachings of our prophets, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>It is a joy for me to be here and also to be mindful of those young people joining us for the first time since their graduation from high school. The message today is going to be one of a testimony of prophets and why we should listen to a prophet’s voice. Yesterday the drive by the cortege to Whitney, Idaho, was a touching tribute to a prophet of God.</p>
<p>There was a tribute by members of the Church as they lined the highway and stood on the overpasses along the road. Some were dressed in their Sunday best on a Saturday afternoon. Others paused in respect, stopping their cars and standing reverently, waiting for the prophet to pass. Farmers stood in their fields with their hats over their hearts. Probably more significant were the young boys taking their baseball hats off and putting them over their hearts. Flags waved good-bye as the prophet went by as well. There were signs that read, “We love President Benson.” Others said, “Read the Book of Mormon.”</p>
<p>As we spontaneously sang “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet” at the closing of the graveside service in Whitney, the beautiful refrain bore record of the privilege we have to be led by prophets in these latter days. I’d like to read the words:</p>
<p><i>We thank thee, O God, for a prophet</i><br />
<i>To guide us in these latter days.</i><br />
<i>We thank thee for sending the gospel</i><br />
<i>To lighten our minds with its rays.</i><br />
<i>We thank thee for every blessing </i><br />
<i>Bestowed by thy bounteous hand.</i><br />
<i>We feel it a pleasure to serve thee,</i><br />
<i>And love to obey thy command.</i></p>
<p><i>When dark clouds of trouble hang o’er us</i><br />
<i>And threaten our peace to destroy,</i><br />
<i>There is hope smiling brightly before us,</i><br />
<i>And we know that deliv’rance is nigh.</i><br />
<i>We doubt not the Lord nor his goodness.</i><br />
<i>We’ve proved him in days that are past.</i><br />
<i>The wicked who fight against Zion</i><br />
<i>Will surely be smitten at last.</i></p>
<p><i>We’ll sing of his goodness and mercy.</i><br />
<i>We’ll praise him by day and by night,</i><br />
<i>Rejoice in his glorious gospel,</i><br />
<i>And bask in its life-giving light.</i><br />
<i>Thus on to eternal perfection</i><br />
<i>The honest and faithful will go,</i><br />
<i>While they who reject this glad message</i><br />
<i>Shall never such happiness know.</i><br />
[“We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet,” <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 19]</p>
<p>With the passing of President Benson, our prophet, on Monday, May 30, at 2:35 p.m., the events that have transpired have presented me with solemn, spiritual experiences and personal participation as a witness in sacred priesthood governance.</p>
<p>When the president of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved, and the counselors take their place in seniority of calling in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Quorum of the Twelve then presides over the Church until the First Presidency is reorganized. The president of the Quorum of the Twelve is automatically the presiding officer of the Church when there is no First Presidency.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, May 31, the Quorum of the Twelve met with President Hunter presiding as the senior member of the Quorum. It was a beautiful meeting with honor and testimony given in brotherhood for the loving memories of President Benson.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning all the General Authorities who were in Salt Lake City attended a fast and testimony meeting in the temple in honor of President Benson. The testimonies were rich in expressions of love and gratitude for the teachings and example of President Benson’s life of service. It was interesting that each one of us had been touched in our lives as we had served with him.</p>
<p>Thursday evening we had the opportunity of bringing our families to pay homage to our dear departed prophet at the Church Administration Building, where President Benson lay in state. My choicest experience was an opportunity of being able to bear testimony to my children and grandchildren of prophets in these latter days.</p>
<p>Friday, for twelve hours, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., thousands of devoted members of the Church and citizens of the community paid their respect as they filed by President Benson’s casket in the rotunda of the Church Office Building. I took some time to observe those who came. The love and devotion they expressed for President Benson as they reverently waited and filed slowly past was touching. Many expressed to one another in hushed tones their personal witness of the prophet’s goodness.</p>
<p>Saturday’s funeral services expressed a rich outpouring of the Spirit being manifest in honor of one of the great servants in this dispensation. The Quorum of the Twelve and the seven Presidents of Seventy served as honor guard as the casket entered and departed the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>After the funeral the honor guard drove as a cortege to Whitney, Idaho, to participate in the graveside service. President Benson’s loving son dedicated the grave site. President Benson was then placed to rest beside his beloved Flora—reunited with his companion of sixty-five years.</p>
<p>It was an eventful week, one I shall never forget because of the spiritual experiences that strengthened my testimony of the truthfulness of this great work.</p>
<p>A solemn assembly will be held during October conference. Each of us will have the opportunity to sustain the officers of the Church. President John Taylor taught us regarding the sustaining of officers:</p>
<p><i>We hold up our right hand when voting in token before God that we will sustain those for whom we vote. . . . For when we lift up our hands in this way, it is in token to God that we are sincere in what we do, and that we will sustain the parties we vote for. . . . If we agree to do a thing and do not do it, we become covenant breakers and violators of our obligations, which are, perhaps, as solemn and binding as anything we can enter into. </i>[<i>JD</i> 21:207]</p>
<p>A sustaining vote is a public commitment of our own willingness to be obedient and to consecrate our lives to furthering the work of the Lord. The sustaining of officers is called <i>the law of common consent. </i>Sustaining is a principle of agency. Church officers are chosen by the spirit of revelation resting upon those priesthood holders set apart to call and ordain.</p>
<p>Sustaining is the public affirmation of our acceptance of priesthood authority as stated in the fifth article of faith:</p>
<p><i>We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.</i> [Articles of Faith 1:5]</p>
<p>Yes, this has been a historic week for the Church. The passing of President Benson marks the end of an era. How appropriate that the death of our patriot prophet came on Memorial Day, when we honor those who served our nation defending our constitutional freedoms.</p>
<p>President Benson devoted his life to testifying about Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. Here are my personal remembrances of President Benson:</p>
<p>First was his ability to sincerely communicate one-on-one directly with each of us who served with him. He would sit at his desk. I would be seated just to his right in a chair facing his large swivel chair. He would sit there with his large from-plowboy-to-prophet hands, our knees almost touching, and look me directly in the eyes with a depth of inner feeling that touched my very soul and tell me what was important for me to know or to do in my life or calling. When I left his office there was no doubt in my mind that I had been instructed by a prophet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Second, President Benson was fearless in the cause of truth and right. He was a living example of the words of the hymn “Do what is right; let the consequence follow” (<i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 237). God bless his memory.</p>
<p>On one occasion in Europe I remember kneeling in prayer beside President Benson when we were at the point of selecting a stake president. What a great joy to participate with him in prayer and understand the true order of prayer and what it means to be able to call upon the Lord for revelation.</p>
<p>Apostles of all ages have had the character traits of courage and fearlessness. President Howard W. Hunter demonstrated his courage at this very pulpit. When faced by a terrorist threat to read a statement to which President Hunter could not agree, President Hunter calmly said, “No, I can’t read that statement”—even though his assailant stood next to him, threatening him with what he said was an explosive device. Would that each of us would have the courage to say no when we are faced with making choices that we know are not right.</p>
<p>Another example of President Hunter’s courage and determination to complete a task given him by the First Presidency is demonstrated by the completion of the Jerusalem Center. President Hunter purchased the land, supervised the architecture and construction of the center, and negotiated with government and religious leaders the teaching objectives for the center. During the years it took to complete the Jerusalem Center, President Hunter demonstrated a steadfastness and courage against opposition. He told those who worked with him, “Go ahead, move forward. Don’t take counsel from your fears.” How often we don’t even try, and we fail simply because of our fear of failure.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago President Hunter bore testimony that we should turn to the prophets of this dispensation for counsel and direction in our lives. He said,</p>
<p><i>To peoples of past dispensations and ages, the most important prophet was the one then living, teaching, and revealing the will of the Lord in their time. In each of the past dispensations, prophets have been raised up by the Lord as his spokesmen to the people of that particular age and for the specific problems of that age.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the present living prophet who is our leader, our teacher. It is from him we take direction in the modern world. From all corners of the earth, we who sustain him as a prophet of the Lord, express our appreciation for this source of divine guidance. We are grateful for his life, his example, his teachings, his leadership. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>As the prophets from the beginning to the present day pass in review before our memory, we become aware of the great blessing which comes to us from the influence of a living prophet. History should teach us that unless we are willing to heed the warnings and follow the teachings of a prophet of the Lord, we will be subject to the judgments of God</i>. [<i>CR, </i>October 1963, p. 101]</p>
<p>President Hunter’s miracle recoveries from death’s door have been a testimony to all of us that the Lord has a mission for him to fulfill.</p>
<p>President Hunter, like President Kimball and President Benson, met adversity with a spirit of quiet, resolute determination that has strengthened and blessed all who have been close to them.</p>
<p>The testimonies of the Savior given by prophets are eloquent and bold in challenging each of us to bear witness. President Hunter has been an example to me since I have been in the Quorum. Here is one great testimony he gave:</p>
<p><i>Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, pupil of Aristotle, conqueror of most of the known world in his time, was one of the world’s great young leaders. After years of exercising military pomp and prowess and after extending his kingdom from Macedonia to Egypt and from Cyprus to India, he wept when there seemed to be no more world to conquer. Then, as evidence of just how ephemeral such power is, Alexander caught a fever and died at thirty-three-years of age. The vast kingdom he had gained virtually died with him.</i></p>
<p><i>Quite a different young leader also died at what seems such an untimely age of thirty-three. He likewise was a king, a pupil, and a conqueror. Yet he received no honors from man, achieved no territorial conquests, rose to no political station. So far as we know, he never held a sword nor wore even a single piece of armor. But the kingdom he established still flourishes some two thousand years later. His power was not of this world.</i></p>
<p><i>The differences between Alexander and this equally young Nazarene are many. But the greatest difference is in their ultimate victories. Alexander conquered lands, peoples, principalities, and earthly kingdoms. But he who is called the Perfect Leader, he who was and is the Light and Life of the world—Jesus Christ the Son of God—conquered what neither Alexander nor any other could defeat or overcome: Jesus of Nazareth conquered death. Against the medals and monuments of centuries of men’s fleeting victories stands the only monument necessary to mark the eternal triumph—an empty garden tomb. </i>[<i>CR, </i>April 1986, pp. 17–18]</p>
<p>I give my testimony of the Savior and that empty tomb and what it means to us to be able to pray to the Savior when we have a problem and to be able to get an answer. President Hunter challenges us that we cannot secretly be a disciple:</p>
<p><i>The world needs men who are willing to step forward and declare themselves. The world needs men who will lift the load of responsibility to their shoulders and carry it high under the banner of Jesus Christ—men who are willing to defend the right openly. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>How can men of conscience ignore the teachings of the Master in their daily affairs, in business, or in government? We stand by and wink at many things because we fear to do anything about them. We may be against crime . . . , but what do we do about it? We may be against corruption in government or against juvenile delinquency, but what do we do about it? We may have a belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ, but what are we doing about it? We need to push fear into the background and come forward with a definite, positive declaration, and assume responsibility. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Now is the time for those who have been noncommittal or who have had a halfhearted interest to come out boldly and declare belief in Christ and be willing to demonstrate faith by works. </i>[<i>CR, </i>October 1960, pp. 108–9]</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us how to overcome fear, declare belief in Christ, and be willing to demonstrate faith by works, even by giving his very life.</p>
<p>This month, June 1994, marks 150 years since the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and his brother Hyrum Smith, the patriarch of the Church, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844.</p>
<p>Section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants was written by Elder John Taylor of the Council of the Twelve, who was a witness to the events of the Martyrdom. Joseph Smith prophetically and willingly gave his life to certify his testimony and faith in this great work.</p>
<p><i>When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said: “I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer’s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL YET BE SAID OF ME—HE WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD.” </i>[D&amp;C 135:4]</p>
<p>The Prophet’s martyrdom was a voluntary acceptance of death at the hands of evil hirelings, “To seal the testimony of this book [the Doctrine and Covenants] and the Book of Mormon” (D&amp;C 135:1) and to bear holy witness of Jesus Christ and his gospel in this dispensation. Christ himself was a martyr who, through his atoning sacrifice, voluntarily laid his life down; according to our Heavenly Father’s plan, that immortality and eternal life would become available to all who came to dwell on earth.</p>
<p>Jesus, too, prophesied of the events that were to happen in his life and went willingly, giving testimony of who he was:</p>
<p><i>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</i></p>
<p><i>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. </i>[John 10:14–18]</p>
<p>For both the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., and our Savior Jesus Christ it can be said, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).</p>
<p>True religious martyrs are part of an eternal gospel plan and earn an eternal reward: “Whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name’s sake [and the gospel’s], shall find it again, even life eternal” (D&amp;C 98:13; see also Mark 8:35). The pioneers who gave their lives in the westward trek are martyrs also, but not in the same way as the prophet who held the priesthood keys and willingly gave his life in testimony to seal his work in this dispensation. Brigham Young gave this teaching about the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith:</p>
<p><i>For they killed the prophets . . . ; and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from the ground against them. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Many have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and the wicked might be condemned. </i>[D&amp;C 136:36, 39]</p>
<p>Elder John Taylor writes of the “innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw” (D&amp;C 135:7).</p>
<p>In Revelation 4 and 5 the apostle John records that a door was opened in heaven. He saw the Lord, Jesus Christ, seated on a throne with a book in his right hand and “a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book?” (Revelation 5:1–2).</p>
<p>John was told he was worthy to see the book. And when the Lord had opened the fifth seal, “I [John] saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held” (Revelation 6:9).</p>
<p>Throughout the teachings about the Martyrdom, testimony is one of the central themes. What was to become of the Church and the priesthood that the Prophet restored and of the Saints who believed in Joseph’s testimony? Elders Parley P. Pratt, Brigham Young, and most of the other members of the Quorum of the Twelve were on missions throughout the Eastern States. In Parley P. Pratt’s autobiography (<i>PPP, </i>chapter 42, pp. 290–96), he writes of the mood of the day at the time: “A day or two previous to this circumstance [the Martyrdom] I had been constrained by the Spirit to start prematurely for home, without knowing why or wherefore.” Parley, with his companion and brother William Pratt, followed the prompting of the Spirit and booked passage on a canal boat from Utica, New York, to Buffalo, New York. Parley wrote,</p>
<p><i>As we conversed together on the deck, a strange and solemn awe came over me, as if the powers of hell were let loose. I was so overwhelmed with sorrow I could hardly speak. . . . I . . . exclaimed—“Brother William, . . . let us observe an entire and solemn silence, for this is a dark day, and the hour of triumph for the powers of darkness.” </i>[p. 292]</p>
<p>William and Parley then separated, and Parley took a steamer for Chicago.</p>
<p><i>The steamer touched at a landing in Wisconsin, some fifty or sixty miles from Chicago, and here some new passengers came on board and brought the news of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Great excitement prevailed on board, there being a general spirit of exultation and triumph at this glorious news, as it was called. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Many passengers now gathered about me and tauntingly inquired what the Mormons would do now, seeing their Prophet and leader was killed.</i></p>
<p><i>To these taunts and questions I replied, that they </i>[the Mormons] <i>would continue their mission and spread the work he had restored, in all the world. Observing that nearly all the prophets and Apostles who were before him had been killed, and also the Saviour of the world, and yet their death did not alter the truth nor hinder its final triumph.</i></p>
<p><i>At this reply many of them seemed astonished. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Landing in Chicago I found great excitement, and the press had issued extras announcing the triumph of the murderous mob in killing the Smiths. </i>[pp. 292–93]</p>
<p>It took Parley two or three days to go to Peoria, Illinois. He then had a distance of 105 miles to go on foot to Nauvoo. He “walked along over the plains of Illinois, lonely and solitary,” and reflected on what he would find in Nauvoo. His thoughts turned to the grieving widows of the two martyrs:</p>
<p><i>How shall I meet an entire community bowed down with grief and sorrow unutterable? What shall I say? . . . I walked onward, weighed down as it were unto death. When I could endure it no longer, I cried out aloud, saying: O Lord! in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Thee, show me what these things mean, and what I shall say to Thy people? On a sudden the Spirit of God came upon me, and filled my heart with joy and gladness indescribable. . . . The Spirit said unto me: “Lift up your head and rejoice; for behold! it is well with my servants Joseph and Hyrum. My servant Joseph still holds the keys of my kingdom in this dispensation, and he shall stand in due time on the earth, in the flesh, and fulfil that to which he is appointed. Go and say unto my people in Nauvoo, that they shall continue to pursue their daily duties and take care of themselves, and make no movement in Church government to reorganize or alter anything until the return of the remainder of the Quorum of the Twelve. But exhort them that they continue to build the House of the Lord which I have commanded them to build in Nauvoo.” </i>[pp. 293–94]</p>
<p>Parley went on his way rejoicing and arrived in Nauvoo ready to spread his message to the people.</p>
<p><i>In confirmation that the message was right, I found them already renewing their labors on the Temple, under the direction of John Taylor and Willard Richards, who were members of our quorum, and were in jail with the prophets when they were murdered—Taylor being wounded with four bullets, and Richards escaping uninjured.</i></p>
<p>Parley Pratt concludes this chapter with the following:</p>
<p><i>President Brigham Young was unanimously chosen and upheld in the Presidency of the whole Church; the keys of which he held by virtue of his apostleship, being the senior and President of the highest quorum </i>[the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles] <i>of the Church then living in the flesh. </i>[p. 296]</p>
<p>In closing, may I remind each of us that we don’t give our testimony and lives in death in the manner that Joseph Smith, the martyred Prophet, gave his life because that was part of his mission. Rather, we give testimony by devoted service in our lives each day to lift and to strengthen others.</p>
<p>In the same manner that the people sorrowed at the death of Joseph Smith, we sorrow in this day for the loss of President Benson. But, also, I bear witness that in the same manner that Brigham Young led the Church after following a great prophet, our next prophet will do the same in our day. I give you my testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. This talk today has been a testimony of prophets and of the importance that we know of their divine calling as leaders in this dispensation. That each of us may be able to be obedient and follow the teachings of our prophets, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Perhaps you would also like to know, if you don’t already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monson’s close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because I’m sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, I’d like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didn’t know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have looked forward to the opportunity of accepting the assignment and the invitation to be with you today, for I realize you are the heart and soul of many of the parents of this Church, all over the world. What a glorious sight you are! I am also pleased to recognize the officers and faculty members of this fine institution.
My dear young brothers and sisters, you are in the prime of your lives. You are on the cutting edge of progress. You live in a time of extreme difficulties but also a time of exceptional opportunities. I think the nation and the world have never been beset with a greater variety of challenges to meet and problems to solve, and you and those similar to you are destined to meet those challenges and to solve those problems. I know you can, because the Lord will provide the help you need.
I love the passage from the book of Acts in the New Testament where we read of the confrontation between a man from Ethiopia, who was reading from scripture, and Philip of old. Philip asked the man if he understood the words he was reading. The man replied to Philip, “How can I, except some man should guide me?”1 Of course Philip sat with him and guided him in his understanding.
Just last Thursday I was sitting in the room in the Salt Lake Temple where the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve meet once each week. I gazed up at the wall which faces the First Presidency, and there I observed a portrait of each President of the Church. As my gaze moved from the Prophet Joseph right down through President Hinckley, I thought, “We have had great Presidents of this Church. Each one has guided us; his writings have stimulated us; his messages have inspired us. To show us the way, we have those whom the Lord has provided.”
Some years ago I spoke here of the Presidents of the Church I have known, giving brief personal glimpses. Today I would like to mention each one in greater depth.
The man who was President of the Church when I was born and who was president until I was nearly eighteen years old was the seventh President of the Church, Heber J. Grant. He was ordained and set apart as President on November 23, 1918, at the age of 62.
The Church was a little different when President Grant was President. His personal office was what we refer to now as the First Presidency Boardroom. He sat at a large, rather imposing desk in the enormous room, and just about anyone could drop in to see him. The Church was relatively small at the time. A friend of mine told me that he and another young man had been asked to visit President Grant to see if he would come to their ward and speak at the commemoration of the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood they were planning. He said they walked through the front door of the Church Administration Building, walked to the back of the building where President Grant’s secretary sat, and said, “Is the President in?”
She replied, “Yes, wou</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thirty-three years ago, while a student at Brigham Young University, I had a small role in an evening fireside like the one we are holding tonight. The speaker was President Spencer W. Kimball, and I found myself walking next to him as he moved toward the entry coming into the Marriott Center. I asked him if he ever became nervous standing before such a large assembly. With a smile, he responded: “Brother Andersen, you know that the scriptures say, ‘If ye are prepared ye shall not fear’ (D&amp;C 38:30). I am trembling from my head to my toes.” Tonight I know how he felt.
I express my love and respect for each of you seated here and for you who are gathered across the world. I know of your goodness and devotion to the gospel, your faith and hope for the future, and your desire to please your Heavenly Father. I pray that the Lord’s Spirit will bless my words and your understanding.
Hold Fast to the Iron Rod
I want to tell you of the Lord’s guiding hand in our meeting tonight. During the early days of January I worked to organize and outline what I would present to you. Knowing that Elder David A. Bednar was scheduled to speak to you in February, I asked him if he had finalized the subject he would address.
I was taken aback when he responded that his talk was about holding fast to the iron rod. It was the exact title I had chosen for my talk. The choir was already practicing this beautiful number that they have just shared with us.
As Elder Bednar and I discussed the messages we had prepared, it was evident that we had approached the subject differently. Elder Bednar thought for a moment and said: “The Lord loves the young adults of the Church. There is purpose in this. This is a message the Lord wants delivered.” I determined to proceed.
Then, just a week later and before Elder Bednar’s talk, President Boyd K. Packer, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a BYU devotional address he entitled “Lehi’s Dream and You.”1 He too included in his talk what it means to hold fast to the iron rod.
My brothers and sisters, this is a subject the Lord wants you to think about.
You will remember from the talks of President Packer and Elder Bednar, and from your own study of the Book of Mormon, the key elements of Lehi’s dream of the tree of life. Elder Bednar taught us that the tree of life, identified as the love of God, is a representation of Jesus Christ and that the joy and happiness received by partaking of the fruit of the tree symbolizes the blessings of the Savior’s Atonement (see 1 Nephi 8:10; 11:8–9, 21–24).2

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great honor for me to welcome you to a new semester at Brigham Young University. My husband and I want you to know that we love and admire you. Your success and growth spiritually, academically, intellectually, and socially are of great importance to us as well as to others associated with the university. In every area of interest to you we encourage you to strive for integrity and excellence. The experiences and knowledge gained during your time here will influence the rest of your lives.
A few years ago my husband and I were enjoying visiting Australia. It was promising to be another beautiful spring day in the outskirts of Sydney. We were to be involved in a mission presidents’ seminar for presidents and their wives in that area of the world. However, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, the telephone rang and woke us from our sleep. My experience with middle-of-the-night telephone calls has been that they usually portend bad news. Thus, as my husband got out of bed to answer the phone, I was quite nervous and concerned. As he answered the phone, I heard him say, “Hello, Emma.”
I relaxed somewhat, knowing that Emma was his secretary in the Office of the Seventy. I knew that we were 16 hours ahead of Salt Lake City time and it was Tuesday during working hours there. My thought was that she just wanted to talk to him before he became involved in the meetings of the day. However, his response to whatever she was saying to him was a very shocked “Oh, no!”
Again I became very concerned and surmised that it was not good news but involved something or someone from the Church family and not our own immediate one. I recall that he hung up the telephone and came and said to me that Emma had just reported to him that two planes had hit the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. We were instructed to remain in Australia until further notice.
We, of course, got up and turned on the television and were filled with shock, horror, and great sadness as we saw and heard of the devastating attacks in our homeland. The seminar began that day, but, as you can imagine, it wasn’t quite business as usual. A great somberness filled all our hearts. I felt such a heaviness of spirit.
The day proceeded with an abbreviated schedule as well as phone calls by the participants in the seminar to their homes and families. We were also informed that we would be able to receive the audio portion of a program to be held that evening originating from the Tabernacle on Temple Square.
The time came to hear the broadcast from Salt Lake City. I cannot recall exactly what was said or sung that night; however, I can vividly recall how I was affected when I heard the voice of our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, as he spoke from thousands of miles away. Just to hear his voice seemed to lift much of the sadness and gloom I was feeling. I will always remember and treasur</span>
