  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Brothers and sisters, aloha! Dont worry. I know I am on the right campus. I am conscious, coherent, and oriented. I thought the sunshine in that aloha greeting would warm us up here in Utah and bring smiles to our faces. I am humbled by this opportunity to stand before you and share a message from my heart. May the Holy Ghost abide with us and speak peace to our hearts.

I remember being in third grade when my sister Jean took me and two of our younger siblings to watch a movie adaptation of Homers epic featuring the hero Odysseus. Considering how poor we were, watching a movie was an extravagance that did not happen often. But I thought we got our moneys worth, because it was a long movie. The voyage home to Ithaca for Odysseus and his men proved to be anything but easy and speedy. I was mesmerized by scenes such as Odysseus blinding the one-eyed cyclops, Polyphemus, son of Poseidon, which then enraged Poseidon; the tribe of gigantic cannibals, or Laestrygonians; and the lure of the enchanting music and voices of the sea sirens.

Now that I am much older, I look at it differently. Instead of focusing on the frame-by-frame cinematography, I am drawn to the story line and the lessons it holds. For instance, the trip to Ithaca was costly in terms of lives lost and years wasted. This was not because the voyage was not worth taking. It was their personal choices, in the face of pride and temptations, that dictated their course and the length of their voyage. In the end, more than the Trojan War, it was this journey that changed Odysseus. Hence, we refer to difficult and life-changing journeys as personal odysseys.

The Greek poet Konstantinos Kavafis likened the voyage to Ithaca to our personal odysseys. He spoke of the maturity and the wisdom that can attend such experience. To quote selected stanzas of his poem:

&lt;i&gt;When you set out for Ithaka&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ask that your way be long,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;full of adventure, full of instruction.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;angry Poseidon - do not fear them:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;such as these you will never find&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;as long as your thought is lofty, as long as a rare&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;emotion touch&lt;/i&gt;[es]&lt;i&gt; your spirit and your body.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;angry Poseidon - you will not meet them&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;unless you carry them in your soul,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;unless your soul raise&lt;/i&gt;[s]&lt;i&gt; them up before you.&lt;/i&gt;
. . .

&lt;i&gt;Have Ithaka always in your mind.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Your arrival there is what you are destined for.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But dont in the least hurry the journey.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Better it last for years,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;so that when you reach the island you are old,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;rich with all you have gained on the way,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;not expecting Ithaka to give you wealth.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ithaka gave you the splendid journey.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Without her you would not have set out.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;She hasnt anything else to give you.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasnt deceived you.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;So wise have you become, of such experience,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that already youll have understood what these Ithakas mean.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journey of the Soul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Life itself is a journey. Setting out for our personal Ithacas is embarking on a voyage of transformation. This is a journey that we know in our hearts to be right but is somehow beset by challenges. As students, are we determined not to give up on our academic journeys despite the difficulties? For those among us in the middle of our careers and currently navigating our way into our own Ithacas, how is this defining us as individuals and our relationships with our families and our God? How we respond reveals our character and inner strength. Either we can let the setbacks define us or we can choose to move forward. If we choose to, we can arrive at our destination a far different person - hopefully much better and wiser. Going through the journey itself is a reward. The lessons therein test our capacities and strengthen our souls until we measure up to the privilege of our positions as sons or daughters of God.

The scriptures are filled with records of travel whose messages apply to our personal journeys. In the Old Testament, several accounts are of epic proportions, one of which is the Exodus. Led by Moses, the flight of the Israelites out of Egypt to the land of Canaan was not the fastest or the shortest route by the standards of our present GPS. The stopover in the wilderness took 40 long years.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps it was from here that we heard the original version of "Are we there yet?" The grumblings were incessant. The Israelites felt stuck in the wilderness.

What lessons can we take away from the Exodus? This 40-year sojourn in the wilderness was not a side trip but a pivotal event. Humility, faith, obedience, trust, and dedication - virtues necessary for a people to be true to their eternal promises - were forged in the wilderness, not in the comforts of Canaan. It was in Sinai, not in Canaan, that Moses received the Ten Commandments. It was in the desolation of the wilderness that God walked before His people, in a pillar of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Miracle after miracle attended the children of Israel. From the parting of the Red Sea to the borders of the land of Canaan and beyond, the hand of the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob had so tenderly cared for His people. Has the Lord treated us any differently now?&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

In these journeys, we bring with us our faith and our attitude. Contrast the murmurings of the Israelites with Nephis "I will go; I will do"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; attitude to the Lords commands as recorded in the Book of Mormon. The combination of the right attitude and righteous choices allowed Nephi to be more receptive to the Spirit of the Lord. It not only made the voyage to the promised land possible, it defined Nephi as a man and as a prophet. Likewise, the journey of faith by the pioneers left behind footprints of extraordinary courage and resolve. What seemed insurmountable became possible because they hung on to their faith that their God would never forsake them. They girded up their loins and with every step took fresh courage until this desert was transformed into a sanctuary of faith.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Whether on land or on sea, in a group of thousands or of a few, life-changing journeys can truly become journeys of the soul if we desire to serve and be like Christ. Perhaps this explains why the missionary section in the Doctrine and Covenants opens up with the word &lt;i&gt;embark.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; One of my favorite accounts of the journey of the soul is the first Christmas night, the prelude to the Atonement. In the New Testament, Luke gave the description of plain, unassuming people watching "their flock by night."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Upon learning of the Saviors birth, these shepherds "came with haste" until they "found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Notice that Luke used the words &lt;i&gt;haste&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;found.&lt;/i&gt; These shepherds set for us the example of running to the Savior with a faith pure and simple, untainted by skepticism. Matthew, on the other hand, spoke of the three Magi searching for the Christ child. Their intent was deliberate and their question direct: "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

I could not find a better example of a personal journey of the soul than that of a repentant heart. The surrendering of our hearts to the Lord is not only transforming but also sanctifying. The eye may never witness nor can the mind measure the tremendous anguish, grief, and sorrow that attend the forsaking of ones sins. That is the Lords purview alone. Such agony is matched only by the strength of ones faith to be healed and the hope for second chances. This journey of penitence can be completed only by the individual with the Savior. Only the combined love of the Father and the love of the Son, as tenderly carried out in the Atonement, has the power to make us whole again. Only such love can "heal without a scar."&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; During times when we feel we are least deserving of such love, President Gordon B. Hinckley assures us:

&lt;i&gt;You are His child all the time, not just when you are good. You are His child when you are bad. You have within you . . . a portion of divinity that is real and tremendous and marvelous and wonderful.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Christ Himself affirmed this eternal truth:

&lt;i&gt;Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

Imagine if this soul happens to be that of a loved one, or perhaps ours.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anchors of the Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Many of us who know the pain of lifes adversities - of sickness, death, divorce, failure, loss of a job, or a loved ones wrong choices - can testify that as we carefully look back, each challenge was met with blessings. Though difficult, the journey seemed short and the burden light. It was as if the weight was not borne by us alone but by many loved ones, by angels, even by the Savior Himself. The Savior has never left us alone, even when our faith was faltering through the journey. He has been with us every step of the way. He has increased our understanding and magnified our strengths that we may "know Him firsthand" (as my sister Jean says). Elder George Q. Cannon beautifully expressed this truth:

&lt;i&gt;No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction,&lt;/i&gt; [God] &lt;i&gt;will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character&lt;/i&gt; [to do so]. &lt;i&gt;He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and He will be the same throughout the eternal ages to come. We have found that God. We have made Him our friend, by obeying His Gospel; and He will stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep His commandments.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

Whether it is in the wilderness of Sinai, the plains crossed by latter-day pioneers, or in the seclusion of our own sacred groves, no journey of the soul can ever be completed unless our hearts are anchored by light and truth. An anchor is something that keeps us steady, secure, and stable. It is a source of support, an emblem of hope, "a sure foundation."&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Such an anchor can only be found in Christ. As Nephi declared:

&lt;i&gt;We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, . . . that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

Throughout the uncertainties of life, only Christ and His love are constant. There is no more perfect example of love than the Atonement itself. Its power and promises are the "hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast."&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; In the end it is the Atonement that unites our journeys, for we are all in need of its power to rescue, to heal, to soften hearts, and to be made whole again. Our baptismal and temple covenants, the priesthood and its ordinances, the sacrament, the scriptures - all point to this great sacrifice. These additional anchors steady us amidst the turmoil of life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Own Journey of Conversion - Tended by the Lord&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There is one more journey that my heart holds dear. It happens to be a story within a story: my familys journey of conversion. In the book of 1 Kings is an account of the faith of a widow in Zarephath, who in time of drought and famine gave up her familys remaining food for the prophet Elijah: "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse."&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

The gospel came in our lives at a time when we had been sufficiently humbled by trials. The most that we literally could offer at the altar was not even a morsel of bread, for we had none but our very faith. It was all that we had. Thus, I liken the widow of Zarephath to a widow in the Philippines, the widow of Tondo with seven children. She is my mother. Let me tell you our story.

There are six girls and a boy in our family - a mix that does not bode well in a society where women are not regarded as mens equals. I am the fifth child in that brood of seven. I was six when my father died of cancer. Our eldest had just turned 18, and the youngest was two years old. The memory is still vivid in my mind as though it happened just yesterday. My mother was by my fathers bedside, exhausted and with her face drenched in tears. Each of the children was summoned by name to approach our fathers side. With my mother holding my fathers right hand, each of us, from the oldest to the youngest, placed our right hand on top of our parents hands. There are seven children. There were seven right hands placed atop each other in a solemn act of promise. It was our fathers dying wish that we look after each other. Then there was silence - a silence broken by my mothers wailing, then by her defeated sobs. My father had passed away.

Without a stable breadwinner and with seven children left to a mother without a job or a college degree, our finances were tenuous. We grew up in poverty - not just income poverty but also a scarcity of opportunities. We were too poor to get an education, but my mother persisted in her dream to have each of her children complete a college degree. She believed in the power of education to enlighten and transform lives, to equalize social standing, and to be the vehicle out of our dismal circumstances. She borrowed money even at high interest rates to keep us in school. I remember rejoicing in being able to take exams (yes, those were joyful, not dreadful, moments), because it meant that my mother was able to pay our tuition. Eventually, the only way for us to go beyond high school was to qualify for scholarships.

Four years after my father died, two young American men knocked on our door looking for my mother. They introduced themselves as missionaries. Behind them was a throng of Filipino children fighting for their attention and calling out, "Hi, Joe." Under the sweltering Philippine heat, these young men stood out in their white shirts, ties, and black briefcases; to us they looked like a toss-up between James Bond and CIA agents. I was about to say to them that my mother had told me to tell them that she was not home when my mothers friends and their children, who came with the missionaries, showed up. My mom overheard and motioned to me to let them in. I quietly asked myself, "What are we getting ourselves into?" Inviting these Americans in was social suicide, as my mom was known in our community for her staunch devotion to the dominant faith.

When my father was alive, he had always invited the missionaries. Not my mother. When my father died, we knew that any opportunity to hear these missionaries died with him. "What could they possibly offer that we still do not have?" was my mothers quick retort to any previous attempts at having our family taught. The year after my father died, martial law was declared in the Philippines. On top of that there was a national shortage of rice - the countrys staple food. To stave off the shortage, rice was combined with corn and rationed to five kilos per family. Food and jobs were scarce. For us to survive, my mom marshaled every inch of strength she had. She talked a friend into allowing her to be paid a meager sum for helping to deliver rice. She would leave at 4:30 in the morning and would come home at 11:00 at night. At the end of the day she would pick up grain after grain of rice and corn that had spilled on the floor of the delivery truck. She would not stop until she had several handfuls for tomorrows meals. Our life was already at its worst. How could listening to these Americans help? What could these missionaries offer that would make our life better?

To our surprise, our mother listened to the missionaries. She even attended an area conference at the Araneta Coliseum presided by President Spencer W. Kimball. That was an act of boldness to go against the predominant religion. This was the 1970s. Peoples minds were strongly averse to changes. It must have exacted much willpower from my mother to stop drinking coffee and to stop smoking - just because two foreigners barely in their twenties said so - at a time when nicotine patches were unheard of. It must have taken real faith to part with a widows mite for tithing.

It was only out of politeness for my mom and the missionaries that I listened. My elder sisters did not want any part of this. Despite our obvious annoyance with the missionaries, they continued to visit and responded to us with love and patience. My mother, my younger sister Ruth, and myself were the first to be baptized. My older sisters followed months later. My brother was baptized when he turned eight. It took years and a temple in the Philippines for our father to be baptized by proxy and for us to be finally sealed as a family.

What did the missionaries offer? They offered us the opportunity of knowing that families can be together even beyond death - something my father had always hoped we could be. The missionaries taught us that we have a Heavenly Father who knows each of us by name and who loves us dearly - a concept so foreign to us, for the God that we knew lashed out with punishments and heard only memorized prayers. The missionaries taught us that our bodies are sacred. They taught us the value of preparedness - temporal and spiritual. The missionaries taught us about where we came from and where we are going. The missionaries offered a message so sweet that it was "most desirable above all things."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; It filled us with joy - not just momentary bliss, but peace and radiance that continued to sustain us through difficult times.

The fruit of the gospel is remarkably sweet, and we paid a high price for it. Following our baptism, relatives and friends distanced themselves from us. They charged my mother with blasphemy and insanity. Some refused to extend any help despite our needs. The loss of that social safety net was economic suicide for a family already living on the edge of poverty. Even as young children we were not spared from many trials, and we had to grow far beyond our years. When I was attending a private school of another religious faith, a nun confronted me in front of my sixth-grade class for choosing to be baptized as a Latter-day Saint. I came home that day in tears. My sister and I were eventually disqualified from receiving the highest academic honors. We were denied the very measure of success that we had worked hard for. This was not the end. Many more challenges came.

How did we keep the faith? First, it was never because we were smarter or stronger, nor were our lives easier. With the help of the Holy Ghost, a conversion rooted within our hearts drove the change. What helped us was that we stayed on course. We did not give up at the very first sign of adversity. We kept going even when the tempests in our lives were raging.&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; We kept paying tithing even when the choices came down to not having enough to eat. We kept coming to Church with the thought that if we continued to do so, eventually principles that were once unclear would make much more sense. We kept going with the understanding that people around us were not perfect but were putting forth the effort to be better.

Second, while it is true that our happiness now and forever depends on the degree of spiritual change in our personal lives, we still needed others support. We were not always brave or fearless, nor could we clearly see even a step ahead into life. We had to rely on borrowed light until we mustered the strength to light our own lamps. We could not have made it this far without the love, understanding, encouragement, and kindness of members and friends.

Has the Lord been mindful of our sacrifices? Yes! He is continually involved in our lives. There was no way that a mother widowed at age 41, without a job and a college degree, could have possibly raised seven children from two to 18 years of age without divine help. Heaven must have heard her many pleadings and interceded in so many ways that it amazes us even to this very day. Through the Lords design and blessings, each of us was able to complete our studies: two doctors, a nurse, a lawyer, an accountant, a hotel and restaurant manager, and an IT support specialist. Thus was the promise of Elijah also fulfilled to the widow of Tondo:

&lt;i&gt;And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

One would not understand how tenderly, patiently, and lovingly the Lord tended our family if I were to skip the sad parts. This is a story of struggles; but, most important, it is a story of faith, hope, and hard work. This is a legacy of faith that we want to leave to our children and their childrens children. The best help heaven extended to us was giving us missionaries who were motivated, who were willing to work long and hard until our hearts were ready to listen and to be touched by the Spirit. These were missionaries who were able to recognize hearts as though the Lord Himself was there. I cannot thank these missionaries without thanking those who lent them to the Lord: their mothers and fathers. To parents of missionaries and their families, thank you for lending your sons and daughters to the Lord. Thank you for your sacrifices. You remind me of Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel, who stated in faith:

&lt;i&gt;For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Whither Goest Thou?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Our lifes ultimate journey is to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; This is the heart of the gospel. The Savior invites us to go on a journey with Him and asks us repeatedly to "come . . . and follow [Him]."&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; As we do so, there will be challenges, but none that cannot be addressed by the Saviors love. Eventually it will be His tender mercies that will save us many times over. For the sorrows that may not be readily seen on the outside, the Lord sees clearly in our hearts, and He offers love. He "sees us in terms of [eternities]."&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

Wherever our personal odysseys may take us, however long or short the transformation of our souls may be, there is a truth I would like to testify of "with all the energy of heart"&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;: God lives. He loves us and loves to bless us. No matter how perilous the journey, Christ is in control. If we allow Him to navigate our lives, "[He] shall fight for [us], and [we] shall hold [our] peace."&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;

As we set our personal sails, let us move forward with this thought from the book of Ether: "The wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land."&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; May the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the love of your eternal companion, and your family and friends lift you up and attend your journey of the soul. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Brothers and sisters, aloha! Dont worry. I know I am on the right campus. I am conscious, coherent, and oriented. I thought the sunshine in that aloha greeting would warm us up here in Utah and bring smiles to our faces. I am humbled by this opportunity to stand before you and share a message from my heart. May the Holy Ghost abide with us and speak peace to our hearts.</p>
<p>I remember being in third grade when my sister Jean took me and two of our younger siblings to watch a movie adaptation of Homers epic featuring the hero Odysseus. Considering how poor we were, watching a movie was an extravagance that did not happen often. But I thought we got our moneys worth, because it was a long movie. The voyage home to Ithaca for Odysseus and his men proved to be anything but easy and speedy. I was mesmerized by scenes such as Odysseus blinding the one-eyed cyclops, Polyphemus, son of Poseidon, which then enraged Poseidon; the tribe of gigantic cannibals, or Laestrygonians; and the lure of the enchanting music and voices of the sea sirens.</p>
<p>Now that I am much older, I look at it differently. Instead of focusing on the frame-by-frame cinematography, I am drawn to the story line and the lessons it holds. For instance, the trip to Ithaca was costly in terms of lives lost and years wasted. This was not because the voyage was not worth taking. It was their personal choices, in the face of pride and temptations, that dictated their course and the length of their voyage. In the end, more than the Trojan War, it was this journey that changed Odysseus. Hence, we refer to difficult and life-changing journeys as personal odysseys.</p>
<p>The Greek poet Konstantinos Kavafis likened the voyage to Ithaca to our personal odysseys. He spoke of the maturity and the wisdom that can attend such experience. To quote selected stanzas of his poem:</p>
<p><i>When you set out for Ithaka</i><br />
<i>ask that your way be long,</i><br />
<i>full of adventure, full of instruction.</i><br />
<i>The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,</i><br />
<i>angry Poseidon - do not fear them:</i><br />
<i>such as these you will never find</i><br />
<i>as long as your thought is lofty, as long as a rare</i><br />
<i>emotion touch</i>[es]<i> your spirit and your body.</i><br />
<i>The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,</i><br />
<i>angry Poseidon - you will not meet them</i><br />
<i>unless you carry them in your soul,</i><br />
<i>unless your soul raise</i>[s]<i> them up before you.</i><br />
. . .</p>
<p><i>Have Ithaka always in your mind.</i><br />
<i>Your arrival there is what you are destined for.</i><br />
<i>But dont in the least hurry the journey.</i><br />
<i>Better it last for years,</i><br />
<i>so that when you reach the island you are old,</i><br />
<i>rich with all you have gained on the way,</i><br />
<i>not expecting Ithaka to give you wealth.</i></p>
<p><i>Ithaka gave you the splendid journey.</i><br />
<i>Without her you would not have set out.</i><br />
<i>She hasnt anything else to give you.</i></p>
<p><i>And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasnt deceived you.</i><br />
<i>So wise have you become, of such experience,</i><br />
<i>that already youll have understood what these Ithakas mean.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<h2><b>Journey of the Soul</b></h2>
<p>Life itself is a journey. Setting out for our personal Ithacas is embarking on a voyage of transformation. This is a journey that we know in our hearts to be right but is somehow beset by challenges. As students, are we determined not to give up on our academic journeys despite the difficulties? For those among us in the middle of our careers and currently navigating our way into our own Ithacas, how is this defining us as individuals and our relationships with our families and our God? How we respond reveals our character and inner strength. Either we can let the setbacks define us or we can choose to move forward. If we choose to, we can arrive at our destination a far different person - hopefully much better and wiser. Going through the journey itself is a reward. The lessons therein test our capacities and strengthen our souls until we measure up to the privilege of our positions as sons or daughters of God.</p>
<p>The scriptures are filled with records of travel whose messages apply to our personal journeys. In the Old Testament, several accounts are of epic proportions, one of which is the Exodus. Led by Moses, the flight of the Israelites out of Egypt to the land of Canaan was not the fastest or the shortest route by the standards of our present GPS. The stopover in the wilderness took 40 long years.<sup>2</sup> Perhaps it was from here that we heard the original version of "Are we there yet?" The grumblings were incessant. The Israelites felt stuck in the wilderness.</p>
<p>What lessons can we take away from the Exodus? This 40-year sojourn in the wilderness was not a side trip but a pivotal event. Humility, faith, obedience, trust, and dedication - virtues necessary for a people to be true to their eternal promises - were forged in the wilderness, not in the comforts of Canaan. It was in Sinai, not in Canaan, that Moses received the Ten Commandments. It was in the desolation of the wilderness that God walked before His people, in a pillar of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.<sup>3</sup> Miracle after miracle attended the children of Israel. From the parting of the Red Sea to the borders of the land of Canaan and beyond, the hand of the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob had so tenderly cared for His people. Has the Lord treated us any differently now?<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>In these journeys, we bring with us our faith and our attitude. Contrast the murmurings of the Israelites with Nephis "I will go; I will do"<sup>5</sup> attitude to the Lords commands as recorded in the Book of Mormon. The combination of the right attitude and righteous choices allowed Nephi to be more receptive to the Spirit of the Lord. It not only made the voyage to the promised land possible, it defined Nephi as a man and as a prophet. Likewise, the journey of faith by the pioneers left behind footprints of extraordinary courage and resolve. What seemed insurmountable became possible because they hung on to their faith that their God would never forsake them. They girded up their loins and with every step took fresh courage until this desert was transformed into a sanctuary of faith.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Whether on land or on sea, in a group of thousands or of a few, life-changing journeys can truly become journeys of the soul if we desire to serve and be like Christ. Perhaps this explains why the missionary section in the Doctrine and Covenants opens up with the word <i>embark.</i><sup>7</sup> One of my favorite accounts of the journey of the soul is the first Christmas night, the prelude to the Atonement. In the New Testament, Luke gave the description of plain, unassuming people watching "their flock by night."<sup>8</sup> Upon learning of the Saviors birth, these shepherds "came with haste" until they "found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."<sup>9</sup> Notice that Luke used the words <i>haste</i> and <i>found.</i> These shepherds set for us the example of running to the Savior with a faith pure and simple, untainted by skepticism. Matthew, on the other hand, spoke of the three Magi searching for the Christ child. Their intent was deliberate and their question direct: "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>I could not find a better example of a personal journey of the soul than that of a repentant heart. The surrendering of our hearts to the Lord is not only transforming but also sanctifying. The eye may never witness nor can the mind measure the tremendous anguish, grief, and sorrow that attend the forsaking of ones sins. That is the Lords purview alone. Such agony is matched only by the strength of ones faith to be healed and the hope for second chances. This journey of penitence can be completed only by the individual with the Savior. Only the combined love of the Father and the love of the Son, as tenderly carried out in the Atonement, has the power to make us whole again. Only such love can "heal without a scar."<sup>11</sup> During times when we feel we are least deserving of such love, President Gordon B. Hinckley assures us:</p>
<p><i>You are His child all the time, not just when you are good. You are His child when you are bad. You have within you . . . a portion of divinity that is real and tremendous and marvelous and wonderful.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Christ Himself affirmed this eternal truth:</p>
<p><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!</i><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Imagine if this soul happens to be that of a loved one, or perhaps ours.</p>
<h2><b>Anchors of the Heart</b></h2>
<p>Many of us who know the pain of lifes adversities - of sickness, death, divorce, failure, loss of a job, or a loved ones wrong choices - can testify that as we carefully look back, each challenge was met with blessings. Though difficult, the journey seemed short and the burden light. It was as if the weight was not borne by us alone but by many loved ones, by angels, even by the Savior Himself. The Savior has never left us alone, even when our faith was faltering through the journey. He has been with us every step of the way. He has increased our understanding and magnified our strengths that we may "know Him firsthand" (as my sister Jean says). Elder George Q. Cannon beautifully expressed this truth:</p>
<p><i>No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction,</i> [God] <i>will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character</i> [to do so]. <i>He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and He will be the same throughout the eternal ages to come. We have found that God. We have made Him our friend, by obeying His Gospel; and He will stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep His commandments.</i><sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Whether it is in the wilderness of Sinai, the plains crossed by latter-day pioneers, or in the seclusion of our own sacred groves, no journey of the soul can ever be completed unless our hearts are anchored by light and truth. An anchor is something that keeps us steady, secure, and stable. It is a source of support, an emblem of hope, "a sure foundation."<sup>15</sup> Such an anchor can only be found in Christ. As Nephi declared:</p>
<p><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, . . . that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i><sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Throughout the uncertainties of life, only Christ and His love are constant. There is no more perfect example of love than the Atonement itself. Its power and promises are the "hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast."<sup>17</sup> In the end it is the Atonement that unites our journeys, for we are all in need of its power to rescue, to heal, to soften hearts, and to be made whole again. Our baptismal and temple covenants, the priesthood and its ordinances, the sacrament, the scriptures - all point to this great sacrifice. These additional anchors steady us amidst the turmoil of life.</p>
<h2><b>My Own Journey of Conversion - Tended by the Lord</b></h2>
<p>There is one more journey that my heart holds dear. It happens to be a story within a story: my familys journey of conversion. In the book of 1 Kings is an account of the faith of a widow in Zarephath, who in time of drought and famine gave up her familys remaining food for the prophet Elijah: "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>The gospel came in our lives at a time when we had been sufficiently humbled by trials. The most that we literally could offer at the altar was not even a morsel of bread, for we had none but our very faith. It was all that we had. Thus, I liken the widow of Zarephath to a widow in the Philippines, the widow of Tondo with seven children. She is my mother. Let me tell you our story.</p>
<p>There are six girls and a boy in our family - a mix that does not bode well in a society where women are not regarded as mens equals. I am the fifth child in that brood of seven. I was six when my father died of cancer. Our eldest had just turned 18, and the youngest was two years old. The memory is still vivid in my mind as though it happened just yesterday. My mother was by my fathers bedside, exhausted and with her face drenched in tears. Each of the children was summoned by name to approach our fathers side. With my mother holding my fathers right hand, each of us, from the oldest to the youngest, placed our right hand on top of our parents hands. There are seven children. There were seven right hands placed atop each other in a solemn act of promise. It was our fathers dying wish that we look after each other. Then there was silence - a silence broken by my mothers wailing, then by her defeated sobs. My father had passed away.</p>
<p>Without a stable breadwinner and with seven children left to a mother without a job or a college degree, our finances were tenuous. We grew up in poverty - not just income poverty but also a scarcity of opportunities. We were too poor to get an education, but my mother persisted in her dream to have each of her children complete a college degree. She believed in the power of education to enlighten and transform lives, to equalize social standing, and to be the vehicle out of our dismal circumstances. She borrowed money even at high interest rates to keep us in school. I remember rejoicing in being able to take exams (yes, those were joyful, not dreadful, moments), because it meant that my mother was able to pay our tuition. Eventually, the only way for us to go beyond high school was to qualify for scholarships.</p>
<p>Four years after my father died, two young American men knocked on our door looking for my mother. They introduced themselves as missionaries. Behind them was a throng of Filipino children fighting for their attention and calling out, "Hi, Joe." Under the sweltering Philippine heat, these young men stood out in their white shirts, ties, and black briefcases; to us they looked like a toss-up between James Bond and CIA agents. I was about to say to them that my mother had told me to tell them that she was not home when my mothers friends and their children, who came with the missionaries, showed up. My mom overheard and motioned to me to let them in. I quietly asked myself, "What are we getting ourselves into?" Inviting these Americans in was social suicide, as my mom was known in our community for her staunch devotion to the dominant faith.</p>
<p>When my father was alive, he had always invited the missionaries. Not my mother. When my father died, we knew that any opportunity to hear these missionaries died with him. "What could they possibly offer that we still do not have?" was my mothers quick retort to any previous attempts at having our family taught. The year after my father died, martial law was declared in the Philippines. On top of that there was a national shortage of rice - the countrys staple food. To stave off the shortage, rice was combined with corn and rationed to five kilos per family. Food and jobs were scarce. For us to survive, my mom marshaled every inch of strength she had. She talked a friend into allowing her to be paid a meager sum for helping to deliver rice. She would leave at 4:30 in the morning and would come home at 11:00 at night. At the end of the day she would pick up grain after grain of rice and corn that had spilled on the floor of the delivery truck. She would not stop until she had several handfuls for tomorrows meals. Our life was already at its worst. How could listening to these Americans help? What could these missionaries offer that would make our life better?</p>
<p>To our surprise, our mother listened to the missionaries. She even attended an area conference at the Araneta Coliseum presided by President Spencer W. Kimball. That was an act of boldness to go against the predominant religion. This was the 1970s. Peoples minds were strongly averse to changes. It must have exacted much willpower from my mother to stop drinking coffee and to stop smoking - just because two foreigners barely in their twenties said so - at a time when nicotine patches were unheard of. It must have taken real faith to part with a widows mite for tithing.</p>
<p>It was only out of politeness for my mom and the missionaries that I listened. My elder sisters did not want any part of this. Despite our obvious annoyance with the missionaries, they continued to visit and responded to us with love and patience. My mother, my younger sister Ruth, and myself were the first to be baptized. My older sisters followed months later. My brother was baptized when he turned eight. It took years and a temple in the Philippines for our father to be baptized by proxy and for us to be finally sealed as a family.</p>
<p>What did the missionaries offer? They offered us the opportunity of knowing that families can be together even beyond death - something my father had always hoped we could be. The missionaries taught us that we have a Heavenly Father who knows each of us by name and who loves us dearly - a concept so foreign to us, for the God that we knew lashed out with punishments and heard only memorized prayers. The missionaries taught us that our bodies are sacred. They taught us the value of preparedness - temporal and spiritual. The missionaries taught us about where we came from and where we are going. The missionaries offered a message so sweet that it was "most desirable above all things."<sup>19</sup> It filled us with joy - not just momentary bliss, but peace and radiance that continued to sustain us through difficult times.</p>
<p>The fruit of the gospel is remarkably sweet, and we paid a high price for it. Following our baptism, relatives and friends distanced themselves from us. They charged my mother with blasphemy and insanity. Some refused to extend any help despite our needs. The loss of that social safety net was economic suicide for a family already living on the edge of poverty. Even as young children we were not spared from many trials, and we had to grow far beyond our years. When I was attending a private school of another religious faith, a nun confronted me in front of my sixth-grade class for choosing to be baptized as a Latter-day Saint. I came home that day in tears. My sister and I were eventually disqualified from receiving the highest academic honors. We were denied the very measure of success that we had worked hard for. This was not the end. Many more challenges came.</p>
<p>How did we keep the faith? First, it was never because we were smarter or stronger, nor were our lives easier. With the help of the Holy Ghost, a conversion rooted within our hearts drove the change. What helped us was that we stayed on course. We did not give up at the very first sign of adversity. We kept going even when the tempests in our lives were raging.<sup>20</sup> We kept paying tithing even when the choices came down to not having enough to eat. We kept coming to Church with the thought that if we continued to do so, eventually principles that were once unclear would make much more sense. We kept going with the understanding that people around us were not perfect but were putting forth the effort to be better.</p>
<p>Second, while it is true that our happiness now and forever depends on the degree of spiritual change in our personal lives, we still needed others support. We were not always brave or fearless, nor could we clearly see even a step ahead into life. We had to rely on borrowed light until we mustered the strength to light our own lamps. We could not have made it this far without the love, understanding, encouragement, and kindness of members and friends.</p>
<p>Has the Lord been mindful of our sacrifices? Yes! He is continually involved in our lives. There was no way that a mother widowed at age 41, without a job and a college degree, could have possibly raised seven children from two to 18 years of age without divine help. Heaven must have heard her many pleadings and interceded in so many ways that it amazes us even to this very day. Through the Lords design and blessings, each of us was able to complete our studies: two doctors, a nurse, a lawyer, an accountant, a hotel and restaurant manager, and an IT support specialist. Thus was the promise of Elijah also fulfilled to the widow of Tondo:</p>
<p><i>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</i></p>
<p><i>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.</i><sup>21</sup></p>
<p>One would not understand how tenderly, patiently, and lovingly the Lord tended our family if I were to skip the sad parts. This is a story of struggles; but, most important, it is a story of faith, hope, and hard work. This is a legacy of faith that we want to leave to our children and their childrens children. The best help heaven extended to us was giving us missionaries who were motivated, who were willing to work long and hard until our hearts were ready to listen and to be touched by the Spirit. These were missionaries who were able to recognize hearts as though the Lord Himself was there. I cannot thank these missionaries without thanking those who lent them to the Lord: their mothers and fathers. To parents of missionaries and their families, thank you for lending your sons and daughters to the Lord. Thank you for your sacrifices. You remind me of Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel, who stated in faith:</p>
<p><i>For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</i></p>
<p><i>Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.</i><sup>22</sup></p>
<h2><b>"Whither Goest Thou?"</b></h2>
<p>Our lifes ultimate journey is to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."<sup>23</sup> This is the heart of the gospel. The Savior invites us to go on a journey with Him and asks us repeatedly to "come . . . and follow [Him]."<sup>24</sup> As we do so, there will be challenges, but none that cannot be addressed by the Saviors love. Eventually it will be His tender mercies that will save us many times over. For the sorrows that may not be readily seen on the outside, the Lord sees clearly in our hearts, and He offers love. He "sees us in terms of [eternities]."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>Wherever our personal odysseys may take us, however long or short the transformation of our souls may be, there is a truth I would like to testify of "with all the energy of heart"<sup>26</sup>: God lives. He loves us and loves to bless us. No matter how perilous the journey, Christ is in control. If we allow Him to navigate our lives, "[He] shall fight for [us], and [we] shall hold [our] peace."<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>As we set our personal sails, let us move forward with this thought from the book of Ether: "The wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land."<sup>28</sup> May the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the love of your eternal companion, and your family and friends lift you up and attend your journey of the soul. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on - and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy - one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of Gods plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch - choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterdays the past, tomorrows the future, but today is a gift. Thats why its called the present.2
With this gift of time, you wont always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Determine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We cant refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of "outstanding life and contribution to society and the world."
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, "With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor."
Then my daughter exclaimed, "What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!"
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xian Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, "Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well." Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer - now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater - in Chinese, "the mother school."
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, "As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them."
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto "Go forth to serve" has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, "go forth to serve" could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of ones undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you - graduates, parents, and other supporters - thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbruck, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they dont. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests - like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesnt end, the quest doesnt end, and our relationships dont end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didnt know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: "Believe in yourself as I believe in you." It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together ("Believe in Yourself," The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
