  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whiplash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One winter’s morning during a snowstorm, I took my mother to have some blood tests done. It was “white-knuckle” driving on snowy, icy roads. We were headed home and going around a corner very slowly. The car hit black ice, and as if in slow motion, we headed for the curb. THUNK! I quickly asked Mom, “Are you OK?”

“Yes.”

We continued cautiously, slowly.

Then I said in an oh-so-sarcastic kind of way, “So I suppose you’re going to sue me for whiplash.” Instantly she jumped in, moaning and holding her neck. “Oh . . . ohhhhhh . . . oh, my neck hurts. . . . Oh, I can’t move my head. . . . Oh dear, I have to call . . .” and she tried to say the name of one of the lawyers who advertises on TV. (“One call . . . that’s all!”) It was so spontaneous and so hilarious that we both laughed until we were screaming.

We eventually came up for air, but Mom kept the fun going for days, calling me, moaning and whining about her whiplash the minute I’d answer.

I’m so grateful for what I have learned from my parents about being cheerful, lighthearted, and—yes—sometimes silly.

It’s a blessing to have been asked to ponder the topic of being merry and praising the Lord. This is another of my “soul-search” topics. I pray that what I have prepared will be uplifting, comforting, thought provoking, and happifying—all in just twenty-five minutes!

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “happiness is the object and design of our existence” (&lt;i&gt;Teachings&lt;/i&gt;, 255).

That’s why our Heavenly Father’s plan is so often called the great plan of happiness. Happiness is part of our nature, as it is part of God’s nature. As Alma taught his son Corianton:

&lt;i&gt;And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state . . . are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 41:11]

We are born with a naturally sunny, optimistic, cheerful disposition. Feeling joy and happiness doesn’t mean we’re always laughing our heads off, although, laughter &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; very therapeutic! President James E. Faust has said: “Don’t forget to laugh at the silly things that happen. Humor . . . is a powerful force for good when used with discretion. Its physical expression, laughter, is highly therapeutic” (“Learning for Eternity,” &lt;i&gt;Brigham Young University 1997–98 Speeches&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1998], 78). He’s right! When we laugh hard, our heart rate speeds up, the circulatory and immune systems are stimulated, and more endorphins are produced. (And then they go perform at Sea World).

In Proverbs we read, “A merry heart doeth good [like] medicine” (17:22). I was told that Picabo Street, the great Olympic skier, wants to become a nurse and work in the ICU so she can answer the phone with “Picabo, ICU.” Isn’t it like a dose of good medicine when we laugh together? It feels unifying!

Abraham Lincoln once said: “With the fearful strain that is on me night and day, if I did not laugh I should die” (quoted in James E. Faust, “The Need for Balance in Our Lives,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; March 2000, 4). I heard that if you want or need to laugh and you don’t—if you suppress laughter—it goes to your hips and spreads out.

Sister Hinckley had (and I’m sure still has) a delightful sense of humor. She said: “The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache” (Virginia H. Pearce, ed., &lt;i&gt;Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999], 107). How we miss her.

A good sense of humor can help us in many ways in life. President Gordon B. Hinckley once said:

&lt;i&gt;We’ve got to have a little humor in our lives. You had better take seriously that which should be taken seriously but, at the same time, we can bring in a touch of humor now and again. If the time ever comes when we can’t smile at ourselves, it will be a sad time.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;TGBH&lt;/i&gt;, 432]

Several years ago my friend Helen told me that in her little town of Vernon, Utah, where there were way too many crickets, they included some cricket recipes in their ward newsletter! I have a special appreciation for those who can laugh even in the midst of challenges.

Someone who tells jokes all the time—to whom everything is funny—does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a sense of humor. And if we hurt someone’s feelings, it’s not funny. The essence of good humor is love! Thomas Carlyle wrote: “True humour springs not more from the head than from the heart; it is not contempt, its essence is love” (quoted in James E. Faust, “The Need for Balance in Our Lives,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; March 2000, 4)

For a few years at the Missionary Training Center, I supervised those learning American Sign Language. One day the supervisor brought her group to my office door to announce they’d been asked to sing for the MTC Christmas program. I could tell something funny was about to happen by the look on her face.

“Do you want to know what they’ve chosen to sing?”

“Of course I do!”

“Our two numbers are “Do You Hear What I Hear?” and “I Heard Him Come.’” The missionaries, several of whom were deaf, laughed and clapped. So did I!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lightheartedness vs. Lightmindedness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I want to return to President Faust’s comment about humor being “a powerful force for good when used with discretion” (“Learning for Eternity,” 78). I’ve done a lot of thinking about the difference between lightheartedness and lightmindedness. I think lightmindedness is thoughtless—literally, without thought. It is empty, meaningless, and wasteful. Often there is hypocrisy and scorn associated with lightminded laughter. It is irreverent and unholy. It separates us from the Spirit. It’s the things we talk and laugh about that don’t encourage, cheer, or edify.

Lightheartedness is goodness—joyful goodness. It includes all that blesses and happifies us and others. It’s being of good cheer while focusing on the things that matter. It’s a virtue.

Truman Madsen tells a story about Heber C. Kimball:

&lt;i&gt;He is praying with his family and in the midst of the prayer says, “Father, bless Brother So-and-So.” Then he bursts into a loud laugh. I can imagine the heads of his children popping up and their eyes opening. There is a slight pause, and then he says, “Lord, it makes me laugh to pray about some people,” and he goes on with his prayer. (see &lt;/i&gt;Life of Heber C. Kimball&lt;i&gt;, p. 427.) I leave you to say whether that is lightmindedness or profound intimacy with the Lord. He knows. We have a funny bone. He gave it to us. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;The Radiant Life&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1994), 6]

President Harold B. Lee has written,

&lt;i&gt;I have never believed that in order to be righteous one must be sad-faced and solemn. People approved of the Lord have always been those who have laughed and danced and sung as well as worshipped, but at all times within proper bounds and not to excess. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Decisions for Successful Living&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973)&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; 154]

I took note when Elder Ballard, in a visit to the MTC in September 1985, told the missionaries that “lightmindedness offends,” and he said, “You can tell!” Then he added, “If we said you couldn’t have a sense of humor, all the Brethren would be in jeopardy” (from author’s personal notes).

President Boyd K. Packer wrote: “A good sense of humor is a characteristic of a well-balanced person. It has always been apparent that the prophets were men with very alert and pleasing senses of humor (&lt;i&gt;Teach Ye Diligently&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 210). I remember a time in the Tabernacle years ago on a Sunday morning during general conference when it was &lt;i&gt;hot&lt;/i&gt;. Everyone was fanning themselves with whatever they could find. President Hinckley got up and said something like “It’s hot in here. We know you’re hot. But you’re not as hot as you’re going to be if you don’t repent!” The laughter was instant and joyful.

We really are happy people. We can’t help it! We know too much! We are like the Nephites—we “[live] after the manner of happiness” (2 Nephi 5:27). And we work at having happy hearts without being lightminded.

We certainly recognize the importance of reverence for all that is sacred. President Boyd K. Packer said, “There are some things just too sacred to discuss. . . . It is not that they are secret, but they are sacred, . . . to be harbored and to be protected and regarded with the deepest of reverence” (“‘The Spirit Beareth Record,’” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; June 1971, 87). We are reverent about our Heavenly Father and His holy Son Jesus Christ, including being reverent with Their names. Jesus’ name is the only name under heaven that can save us! (See Acts 4:12; 2 Nephi 25:20.)

President David O. McKay said, “The greatest manifestation of spirituality is reverence. . . . Reverence is profound respect mingled with love” (“Meditation, Communion, Reverence in Our Houses of Worship,” &lt;i&gt;The Instructor,&lt;/i&gt; October 1966, 371).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happiness and Adversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Happiness does not mean an absence of adversity. Why would our baptismal covenant include bearing one another’s burdens if no one had any burdens? Why would we covenant to mourn with those who mourn and comfort those who stand in need of comfort if no one ever mourned and no one ever needed comforting? (see Mosiah 18:8–9).

Elder Jack H. Goaslind has said:

&lt;i&gt;I am convinced if we are to have happiness in our hearts, we must learn how to preserve it, in our hearts, in the midst of trouble and trial. We can control our attitude toward adversity. Some people are defeated and embittered by it, while others triumph over it and cultivate godlike attributes in the midst of it.&lt;/i&gt; [“Happiness,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1986, 54]

Probably each of us can think of someone who has been refined and who has become more godlike through trials. Elder Goaslind uses the word &lt;i&gt;cultivate.&lt;/i&gt; It indicates work, doesn’t it? We work to develop godlike attributes. President Hinckley has invited us to “cultivate an attitude of happiness. Cultivate a spirit of optimism” (“If Thou Art Faithful,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1984, 92).

Life may not always be exactly what we had in mind, but we’re not alone. Have you noticed that sometimes you draw closer to your Heavenly Father when you are deeply in need? That’s been my experience. And He comes. He is always willing to come. Listen again to what happened to the people of Alma when they were being persecuted by the former priests of Noah:

&lt;i&gt;Lift up your heads and be of good comfort. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I will . . . ease the burdens . . . upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 24:13–14]

Many of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can also be witnesses for Him hereafter, testifying that He also visited you in your afflictions.

Elder James E. Talmage said, “[Happiness] springs from the deeper fountains of the soul, and is not infrequently accompanied by tears. Have you never been so happy that you have had to weep? I have” (“A Greeting to the Missionaries,” &lt;i&gt;Improvement Era,&lt;/i&gt; December 1913, 173). We have too, haven’t we?

Psalm 30 teaches, “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning” (30:5). Doctrine and Covenants adds, “If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful” (136:29).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happiness Is a Result of Righteousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In 2 Nephi 2:13, Lehi is teaching his son Jacob about opposition:

&lt;i&gt;And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God.&lt;/i&gt;

There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a God, there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; righteousness, and there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; happiness.

President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “Happiness comes of righteousness.” He went on to teach that wickedness, sin, selfishness, and greed never bring happiness. And then he said, “Happiness lies in living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ” (“Fast-Paced Schedule for the Prophet,” &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 20 April 1996, 3).

It’s true that “wickedness never was happiness” (Alma 41:10). And so righteousness never was misery. Adversity, deep water, and fiery trials for sure, but not misery. We can choose to cultivate either happiness or misery. Elder Goaslind has said:

&lt;i&gt;Our joy in God’s kingdom will be a natural extension of the happiness we cultivate in this life. &lt;/i&gt;[“Happiness,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1986, 53]

A few weeks ago, a woman shared with me a very interesting experience she had during her stake conference. She said her stake president invited all those who were happy to raise their hands. To them he said “Congratulations! You are candidates for the celestial kingdom. The rest of you need to repent!” Then he added, “I’m convinced that in the celestial kingdom there will only be happy people!”

Moroni illustrates this principle in Mormon 9:14:

&lt;i&gt;And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; and he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.&lt;/i&gt;

We will be “raised to happiness according to [our] desires of happiness” (Alma 41:5) and according to the degree to which we have cultivated happiness right here, right now.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Attitude of Happiness and a Spirit of Optimism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Joy is a gift of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22). President Marion G. Romney said, “The key to happiness [or joy] is to get the Spirit and keep it” (&lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; October 1961, 61). Heber C. Kimball said: “I am perfectly satisfied that my Father and my God is a cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured Being. Why? Because I am cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured when I have His Spirit” (&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 4:222). Has that been your experience? As you have felt the Spirit, have you also felt joy? Joy brings the Spirit, and the Spirit brings joy.

Brigham Young asked:

&lt;i&gt;Where is happiness, real happiness? Nowhere but in God. By possessing the spirit of our holy religion, we are happy in the morning, we are happy at noon, [and] we are happy in the evening. . . . Every Latter-day Saint, who has experienced the love of God in his heart, . . . realizes that he is filled with joy . . . happiness, and consolation.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 236]

Think of someone you enjoy being around, and think about &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;. Through the many years I’ve asked others this question, I can’t think of a single time when someone has said, “Oh, I like to be around Fifi—she is such a downer! What a pessimist! She’s so negative! I can’t be around her more than 2 minutes without feeling just awful!” Cheerful, optimistic people are pleasant to be around. This certainly includes President Hinckley, who has helped so many of us smile and laugh in a happy way. I feel that his optimism and good cheer come in large measure because of his goodness, his righteousness, and his absolute obedience.

Brigham Young said, “It does make the Devil mad . . . that he cannot afflict this people so as to make them have a sad countenance” (&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 236). Another time, he noted: “There is not a man or woman on this earth, whose peace is made with God, and who are associated with holy beings, and seeking after holy principles, but their countenances are lit up with a lamp of divine cheerfulness” (quoted in Truman G. Madsen, “‘The Joy of the Lord Is Your Strength’ (Nehemiah 8:10),” &lt;i&gt;Brigham Young University 2000–2001 Speeches&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: Brigham Young University, 2001], 145). This is taught in Proverbs—“A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance” (Proverbs 15:13)—and by President Hinckley, who said, “Let the light of the gospel shine in your faces wherever you go and in whatever you do” (“Live the Gospel,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1984, 86).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passing Along Joy and Happiness to Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
More than 100 years ago, President George Q. Cannon said:

&lt;i&gt;My experience has proved that there is greater happiness, purer joy and more delight to be obtained in serving God and being active in His work than can be obtained in any other direction. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . We illustrate the great truth that a people can be a profoundly religious people and at the same time be a very happy people. I do not believe there is any happier people on the earth than the Latter-day Saints. . . . There must be the fountain of [happiness] within us; and wherever we go and have that spirit within us, we shall be happy. . . . We should cultivate this, and teach it to our children.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Collected Discourses Delivered by President Wilford Woodruff, His Two Counselors, the Twelve Apostles, and Others,&lt;/i&gt; comp. and ed. Brian H. Stuy (n.p.: B.H.S. Publishing, 1989), 5:394–95]

President Gordon B. Hinckley has encouraged: “Enjoy your membership in the Church. . . . Enjoy your activity. . . Be happy in that which you do. Cultivate a spirit of gladness in your homes” (“Live the Gospel,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1984, 86). I’m so thankful for the spirit my parents cultivated in our home. I thank both of them for the difference it has made in my life to have them share and nurture a sense of humor, a spirit of optimism, and a cheerful disposition. Another time I can share more about my father, but for now I have a few more things to say about my mother, who is close to 90 years old.

One of Mom’s most wonderful qualities is her ability to laugh at herself. Eleven years ago she suffered a major stroke. This affected her in many ways, including her speech, reading, and writing. Just four months after the stroke, she gave a talk right here in the Marriott Center at women’s conference. One of the things she said in her halting way was not to wait to have a stroke—that you could probably enjoy it more if you had it when you were younger. She felt she had waited too long.

One time in her hospital room, my brother Frank and I were watching as she went to the mirror to brush her teeth. She picked up the tube of toothpaste and stood looking at it. Then, very carefully, she put a little dab on her finger. We kept watching, not wanting to interrupt and trying not to laugh. She looked in the mirror and down at her finger, and then she began to rub the toothpaste on her nose. That did it. We started laughing, and she laughed harder than we did. Frank commented that she wouldn’t be getting any cavities on her nose!

This past September, my mother went with me to St. George for a women’s conference. This was during the annual senior games, and as we shuffled into the motel—Mom leaning on her walker and me dragging our luggage—we noticed all the ship-shape senior athletes. I said to her, “Hey, Mom. They think we’re here for the senior games! They’re wondering what our sport is!” That cracked us up!

I’ve spent some challenging times in places far away from my family and from basic conveniences. One thing that “has made all the difference” is to receive letters and packages from home. Once when I was in Hong Kong, Mom sent me a nose-and-glasses combination. How did she know I’d love that? She’s my mother, that’s how. I’d wear it around, including on the busses, and watch for the fun and smiles all around me. When I was in Indonesia, she’d send boxes filled with lovely things she’d found in her basement or at Deseret Industries or received from neighbors wanting to get rid of stuff—from rat traps to aprons, from old drapes to kazoos. While I was in Africa she sent me a Tupperware catalogue, saying that she thought it’d be nice for the sisters out in the bush to have a Tupperware party. We &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; pass along joy and good cheer—and a good sense of humor—to our children and others.

President James E. Faust commented:

&lt;i&gt;For many years as I have blessed newborn children, including my own, I have blessed them with a sense of humor. I do this with the hope that it will help guard them against being too rigid, that they will have balance in their lives, and that situations and problems and difficulties will not be overdrawn. &lt;/i&gt;[“The Need for Balance in Our Lives,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; March 2000, 4]

A mother who was diagnosed with cancer told of being isolated in a bare room for many long days behind closed lead-lined doors, feeling like a prisoner convicted of a crime she didn’t commit. Then she tells of her oldest daughter coming to visit:

&lt;i&gt;She sat down behind the lead screen that separated us and proceeded to take off her boots and socks. She slipped her socks on her hands and pretended they were puppets and spoke through them. I laughed for the first time in months. That simple act brightened my outlook instantly.&lt;/i&gt; [Emily Farmer, “‘What Do I Say to Someone Who Is Dying?’” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; April 1990, 73]

“Count your many blessings, name them one by one”—you never know when one might be missing! Gratitude leads to joy and happiness, just as joy and happiness lead to gratitude and contentment. President Lorenzo Snow said, “It is . . . the duty of every Latter-day Saint to cultivate a spirit of gratitude” (quoted in Rulon D. Pope, “Free-Riding and Gratitude,” &lt;i&gt;Brigham Young University 1999–2000 Speeches&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: Brigham Young University: 2000], 102).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heavenly Father Wants Us to Be Happy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Our Heavenly Father and the Savior want us to experience joy, happiness, and good cheer. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, “ I am satisfied that our Father in Heaven likes to see His children happy—not miserable, but happy” (&lt;i&gt;TGBH,&lt;/i&gt; 256). A &lt;i&gt;Church News&lt;/i&gt; article states: “Some unfortunate souls think that joy is a luxury, one of life’s frills they cannot afford or do not deserve. But . . . it is God who decided that joy is the very purpose for our existence” (“Choosing Joy,” &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 6 February 1993, 16). His plan really &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the great plan of happiness!

Elder Matthew Cowley commented:

&lt;i&gt;I like to get fun out of this business—good, wholesome, righteous fun—get a kick out of it. When I obey the principles of this gospel, I am the happiest man on earth. When I don’t, then I am depressed, then I have a right to worry about myself; but, when I am trying to do the best I know, then I tell you, I am having the time of my life. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Matthew Cowley Speaks&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1954), 133]

Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: “Ultimate hope and daily grumpiness are not reconcilable. It is ungraceful, unjustified, and unbecoming of us as committed Church members to be constantly grumpy or of woeful countenance” (&lt;i&gt;Neal A. Maxwell Quote Book&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], 164).

President Hinckley has several quotes on this topic in the collection of his teachings: “It is very important to be happy in this work. We have a lot of gloomy people in the Church because they do not understand, I guess, that this is the gospel of happiness. It is something to be happy about, to get excited about” (&lt;i&gt;TGBH, &lt;/i&gt;256); “I hope you enjoy this work. I really do. Notwithstanding all the problems, this is a work of happiness. This is the good news! This is a work of joy! I hope you can laugh and smile and be happy and rejoice before the Lord” (&lt;i&gt;TGBH,&lt;/i&gt; 255); “Your happiness lies in following the gospel of Jesus Christ. . . . Happiness lies in faithfulness and in righteousness” (&lt;i&gt;TGBH,&lt;/i&gt; 256). That’s it! That’s the key! Our happiness lies in following the gospel of Jesus Christ—in having faith in Him, believing Him, coming unto Him, and becoming more like Him.

May our deep and tender feelings about the Savior bring us comfort, peace, hope, joy, gratitude, contentment, optimism, a countenance of divine cheerfulness, and genuine happiness. He is the one who invites us to “be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you” (D&amp;amp;C 68:6).

He will. He does. I know it.

			<h2><b>Whiplash</b></h2>
<p>One winter’s morning during a snowstorm, I took my mother to have some blood tests done. It was “white-knuckle” driving on snowy, icy roads. We were headed home and going around a corner very slowly. The car hit black ice, and as if in slow motion, we headed for the curb. THUNK! I quickly asked Mom, “Are you OK?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>We continued cautiously, slowly.</p>
<p>Then I said in an oh-so-sarcastic kind of way, “So I suppose you’re going to sue me for whiplash.” Instantly she jumped in, moaning and holding her neck. “Oh . . . ohhhhhh . . . oh, my neck hurts. . . . Oh, I can’t move my head. . . . Oh dear, I have to call . . .” and she tried to say the name of one of the lawyers who advertises on TV. (“One call . . . that’s all!”) It was so spontaneous and so hilarious that we both laughed until we were screaming.</p>
<p>We eventually came up for air, but Mom kept the fun going for days, calling me, moaning and whining about her whiplash the minute I’d answer.</p>
<p>I’m so grateful for what I have learned from my parents about being cheerful, lighthearted, and—yes—sometimes silly.</p>
<p>It’s a blessing to have been asked to ponder the topic of being merry and praising the Lord. This is another of my “soul-search” topics. I pray that what I have prepared will be uplifting, comforting, thought provoking, and happifying—all in just twenty-five minutes!</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “happiness is the object and design of our existence” (<i>Teachings</i>, 255).</p>
<p>That’s why our Heavenly Father’s plan is so often called the great plan of happiness. Happiness is part of our nature, as it is part of God’s nature. As Alma taught his son Corianton:</p>
<p><i>And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state . . . are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness. </i>[Alma 41:11]</p>
<p>We are born with a naturally sunny, optimistic, cheerful disposition. Feeling joy and happiness doesn’t mean we’re always laughing our heads off, although, laughter <i>is</i> very therapeutic! President James E. Faust has said: “Don’t forget to laugh at the silly things that happen. Humor . . . is a powerful force for good when used with discretion. Its physical expression, laughter, is highly therapeutic” (“Learning for Eternity,” <i>Brigham Young University 1997–98 Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1998], 78). He’s right! When we laugh hard, our heart rate speeds up, the circulatory and immune systems are stimulated, and more endorphins are produced. (And then they go perform at Sea World).</p>
<p>In Proverbs we read, “A merry heart doeth good [like] medicine” (17:22). I was told that Picabo Street, the great Olympic skier, wants to become a nurse and work in the ICU so she can answer the phone with “Picabo, ICU.” Isn’t it like a dose of good medicine when we laugh together? It feels unifying!</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln once said: “With the fearful strain that is on me night and day, if I did not laugh I should die” (quoted in James E. Faust, “The Need for Balance in Our Lives,” <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000, 4). I heard that if you want or need to laugh and you don’t—if you suppress laughter—it goes to your hips and spreads out.</p>
<p>Sister Hinckley had (and I’m sure still has) a delightful sense of humor. She said: “The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache” (Virginia H. Pearce, ed., <i>Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999], 107). How we miss her.</p>
<p>A good sense of humor can help us in many ways in life. President Gordon B. Hinckley once said:</p>
<p><i>We’ve got to have a little humor in our lives. You had better take seriously that which should be taken seriously but, at the same time, we can bring in a touch of humor now and again. If the time ever comes when we can’t smile at ourselves, it will be a sad time.</i> [<i>TGBH</i>, 432]</p>
<p>Several years ago my friend Helen told me that in her little town of Vernon, Utah, where there were way too many crickets, they included some cricket recipes in their ward newsletter! I have a special appreciation for those who can laugh even in the midst of challenges.</p>
<p>Someone who tells jokes all the time—to whom everything is funny—does <i>not</i> have a sense of humor. And if we hurt someone’s feelings, it’s not funny. The essence of good humor is love! Thomas Carlyle wrote: “True humour springs not more from the head than from the heart; it is not contempt, its essence is love” (quoted in James E. Faust, “The Need for Balance in Our Lives,” <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000, 4)</p>
<p>For a few years at the Missionary Training Center, I supervised those learning American Sign Language. One day the supervisor brought her group to my office door to announce they’d been asked to sing for the MTC Christmas program. I could tell something funny was about to happen by the look on her face.</p>
<p>“Do you want to know what they’ve chosen to sing?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do!”</p>
<p>“Our two numbers are “Do You Hear What I Hear?” and “I Heard Him Come.’” The missionaries, several of whom were deaf, laughed and clapped. So did I!</p>
<h2><b>Lightheartedness vs. Lightmindedness</b></h2>
<p>I want to return to President Faust’s comment about humor being “a powerful force for good when used with discretion” (“Learning for Eternity,” 78). I’ve done a lot of thinking about the difference between lightheartedness and lightmindedness. I think lightmindedness is thoughtless—literally, without thought. It is empty, meaningless, and wasteful. Often there is hypocrisy and scorn associated with lightminded laughter. It is irreverent and unholy. It separates us from the Spirit. It’s the things we talk and laugh about that don’t encourage, cheer, or edify.</p>
<p>Lightheartedness is goodness—joyful goodness. It includes all that blesses and happifies us and others. It’s being of good cheer while focusing on the things that matter. It’s a virtue.</p>
<p>Truman Madsen tells a story about Heber C. Kimball:</p>
<p><i>He is praying with his family and in the midst of the prayer says, “Father, bless Brother So-and-So.” Then he bursts into a loud laugh. I can imagine the heads of his children popping up and their eyes opening. There is a slight pause, and then he says, “Lord, it makes me laugh to pray about some people,” and he goes on with his prayer. (see </i>Life of Heber C. Kimball<i>, p. 427.) I leave you to say whether that is lightmindedness or profound intimacy with the Lord. He knows. We have a funny bone. He gave it to us. </i>[<i>The Radiant Life</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1994), 6]</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee has written,</p>
<p><i>I have never believed that in order to be righteous one must be sad-faced and solemn. People approved of the Lord have always been those who have laughed and danced and sung as well as worshipped, but at all times within proper bounds and not to excess. </i>[<i>Decisions for Successful Living</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973)<i>,</i> 154]</p>
<p>I took note when Elder Ballard, in a visit to the MTC in September 1985, told the missionaries that “lightmindedness offends,” and he said, “You can tell!” Then he added, “If we said you couldn’t have a sense of humor, all the Brethren would be in jeopardy” (from author’s personal notes).</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer wrote: “A good sense of humor is a characteristic of a well-balanced person. It has always been apparent that the prophets were men with very alert and pleasing senses of humor (<i>Teach Ye Diligently</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 210). I remember a time in the Tabernacle years ago on a Sunday morning during general conference when it was <i>hot</i>. Everyone was fanning themselves with whatever they could find. President Hinckley got up and said something like “It’s hot in here. We know you’re hot. But you’re not as hot as you’re going to be if you don’t repent!” The laughter was instant and joyful.</p>
<p>We really are happy people. We can’t help it! We know too much! We are like the Nephites—we “[live] after the manner of happiness” (2 Nephi 5:27). And we work at having happy hearts without being lightminded.</p>
<p>We certainly recognize the importance of reverence for all that is sacred. President Boyd K. Packer said, “There are some things just too sacred to discuss. . . . It is not that they are secret, but they are sacred, . . . to be harbored and to be protected and regarded with the deepest of reverence” (“‘The Spirit Beareth Record,’” <i>Ensign,</i> June 1971, 87). We are reverent about our Heavenly Father and His holy Son Jesus Christ, including being reverent with Their names. Jesus’ name is the only name under heaven that can save us! (See Acts 4:12; 2 Nephi 25:20.)</p>
<p>President David O. McKay said, “The greatest manifestation of spirituality is reverence. . . . Reverence is profound respect mingled with love” (“Meditation, Communion, Reverence in Our Houses of Worship,” <i>The Instructor,</i> October 1966, 371).</p>
<h2><b>Happiness and Adversity</b></h2>
<p>Happiness does not mean an absence of adversity. Why would our baptismal covenant include bearing one another’s burdens if no one had any burdens? Why would we covenant to mourn with those who mourn and comfort those who stand in need of comfort if no one ever mourned and no one ever needed comforting? (see Mosiah 18:8–9).</p>
<p>Elder Jack H. Goaslind has said:</p>
<p><i>I am convinced if we are to have happiness in our hearts, we must learn how to preserve it, in our hearts, in the midst of trouble and trial. We can control our attitude toward adversity. Some people are defeated and embittered by it, while others triumph over it and cultivate godlike attributes in the midst of it.</i> [“Happiness,” <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 54]</p>
<p>Probably each of us can think of someone who has been refined and who has become more godlike through trials. Elder Goaslind uses the word <i>cultivate.</i> It indicates work, doesn’t it? We work to develop godlike attributes. President Hinckley has invited us to “cultivate an attitude of happiness. Cultivate a spirit of optimism” (“If Thou Art Faithful,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 92).</p>
<p>Life may not always be exactly what we had in mind, but we’re not alone. Have you noticed that sometimes you draw closer to your Heavenly Father when you are deeply in need? That’s been my experience. And He comes. He is always willing to come. Listen again to what happened to the people of Alma when they were being persecuted by the former priests of Noah:</p>
<p><i>Lift up your heads and be of good comfort. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And I will . . . ease the burdens . . . upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i> [Mosiah 24:13–14]</p>
<p>Many of <i>you</i> can also be witnesses for Him hereafter, testifying that He also visited you in your afflictions.</p>
<p>Elder James E. Talmage said, “[Happiness] springs from the deeper fountains of the soul, and is not infrequently accompanied by tears. Have you never been so happy that you have had to weep? I have” (“A Greeting to the Missionaries,” <i>Improvement Era,</i> December 1913, 173). We have too, haven’t we?</p>
<p>Psalm 30 teaches, “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning” (30:5). Doctrine and Covenants adds, “If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful” (136:29).</p>
<h2><b>Happiness Is a Result of Righteousness</b></h2>
<p>In 2 Nephi 2:13, Lehi is teaching his son Jacob about opposition:</p>
<p><i>And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God.</i></p>
<p>There <i>is</i> a God, there <i>is</i> righteousness, and there <i>is</i> happiness.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “Happiness comes of righteousness.” He went on to teach that wickedness, sin, selfishness, and greed never bring happiness. And then he said, “Happiness lies in living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ” (“Fast-Paced Schedule for the Prophet,” <i>Church News,</i> 20 April 1996, 3).</p>
<p>It’s true that “wickedness never was happiness” (Alma 41:10). And so righteousness never was misery. Adversity, deep water, and fiery trials for sure, but not misery. We can choose to cultivate either happiness or misery. Elder Goaslind has said:</p>
<p><i>Our joy in God’s kingdom will be a natural extension of the happiness we cultivate in this life. </i>[“Happiness,” <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 53]</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a woman shared with me a very interesting experience she had during her stake conference. She said her stake president invited all those who were happy to raise their hands. To them he said “Congratulations! You are candidates for the celestial kingdom. The rest of you need to repent!” Then he added, “I’m convinced that in the celestial kingdom there will only be happy people!”</p>
<p>Moroni illustrates this principle in Mormon 9:14:</p>
<p><i>And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; and he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.</i></p>
<p>We will be “raised to happiness according to [our] desires of happiness” (Alma 41:5) and according to the degree to which we have cultivated happiness right here, right now.</p>
<h2><b>An Attitude of Happiness and a Spirit of Optimism</b></h2>
<p>Joy is a gift of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22). President Marion G. Romney said, “The key to happiness [or joy] is to get the Spirit and keep it” (<i>CR,</i> October 1961, 61). Heber C. Kimball said: “I am perfectly satisfied that my Father and my God is a cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured Being. Why? Because I am cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured when I have His Spirit” (<i>JD</i> 4:222). Has that been your experience? As you have felt the Spirit, have you also felt joy? Joy brings the Spirit, and the Spirit brings joy.</p>
<p>Brigham Young asked:</p>
<p><i>Where is happiness, real happiness? Nowhere but in God. By possessing the spirit of our holy religion, we are happy in the morning, we are happy at noon, [and] we are happy in the evening. . . . Every Latter-day Saint, who has experienced the love of God in his heart, . . . realizes that he is filled with joy . . . happiness, and consolation.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 236]</p>
<p>Think of someone you enjoy being around, and think about <i>why</i>. Through the many years I’ve asked others this question, I can’t think of a single time when someone has said, “Oh, I like to be around Fifi—she is such a downer! What a pessimist! She’s so negative! I can’t be around her more than 2 minutes without feeling just awful!” Cheerful, optimistic people are pleasant to be around. This certainly includes President Hinckley, who has helped so many of us smile and laugh in a happy way. I feel that his optimism and good cheer come in large measure because of his goodness, his righteousness, and his absolute obedience.</p>
<p>Brigham Young said, “It does make the Devil mad . . . that he cannot afflict this people so as to make them have a sad countenance” (<i>DBY,</i> 236). Another time, he noted: “There is not a man or woman on this earth, whose peace is made with God, and who are associated with holy beings, and seeking after holy principles, but their countenances are lit up with a lamp of divine cheerfulness” (quoted in Truman G. Madsen, “‘The Joy of the Lord Is Your Strength’ (Nehemiah 8:10),” <i>Brigham Young University 2000–2001 Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 2001], 145). This is taught in Proverbs—“A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance” (Proverbs 15:13)—and by President Hinckley, who said, “Let the light of the gospel shine in your faces wherever you go and in whatever you do” (“Live the Gospel,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 86).</p>
<h2><b>Passing Along Joy and Happiness to Children</b></h2>
<p>More than 100 years ago, President George Q. Cannon said:</p>
<p><i>My experience has proved that there is greater happiness, purer joy and more delight to be obtained in serving God and being active in His work than can be obtained in any other direction. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . We illustrate the great truth that a people can be a profoundly religious people and at the same time be a very happy people. I do not believe there is any happier people on the earth than the Latter-day Saints. . . . There must be the fountain of [happiness] within us; and wherever we go and have that spirit within us, we shall be happy. . . . We should cultivate this, and teach it to our children.</i> [<i>Collected Discourses Delivered by President Wilford Woodruff, His Two Counselors, the Twelve Apostles, and Others,</i> comp. and ed. Brian H. Stuy (n.p.: B.H.S. Publishing, 1989), 5:394–95]</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has encouraged: “Enjoy your membership in the Church. . . . Enjoy your activity. . . Be happy in that which you do. Cultivate a spirit of gladness in your homes” (“Live the Gospel,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 86). I’m so thankful for the spirit my parents cultivated in our home. I thank both of them for the difference it has made in my life to have them share and nurture a sense of humor, a spirit of optimism, and a cheerful disposition. Another time I can share more about my father, but for now I have a few more things to say about my mother, who is close to 90 years old.</p>
<p>One of Mom’s most wonderful qualities is her ability to laugh at herself. Eleven years ago she suffered a major stroke. This affected her in many ways, including her speech, reading, and writing. Just four months after the stroke, she gave a talk right here in the Marriott Center at women’s conference. One of the things she said in her halting way was not to wait to have a stroke—that you could probably enjoy it more if you had it when you were younger. She felt she had waited too long.</p>
<p>One time in her hospital room, my brother Frank and I were watching as she went to the mirror to brush her teeth. She picked up the tube of toothpaste and stood looking at it. Then, very carefully, she put a little dab on her finger. We kept watching, not wanting to interrupt and trying not to laugh. She looked in the mirror and down at her finger, and then she began to rub the toothpaste on her nose. That did it. We started laughing, and she laughed harder than we did. Frank commented that she wouldn’t be getting any cavities on her nose!</p>
<p>This past September, my mother went with me to St. George for a women’s conference. This was during the annual senior games, and as we shuffled into the motel—Mom leaning on her walker and me dragging our luggage—we noticed all the ship-shape senior athletes. I said to her, “Hey, Mom. They think we’re here for the senior games! They’re wondering what our sport is!” That cracked us up!</p>
<p>I’ve spent some challenging times in places far away from my family and from basic conveniences. One thing that “has made all the difference” is to receive letters and packages from home. Once when I was in Hong Kong, Mom sent me a nose-and-glasses combination. How did she know I’d love that? She’s my mother, that’s how. I’d wear it around, including on the busses, and watch for the fun and smiles all around me. When I was in Indonesia, she’d send boxes filled with lovely things she’d found in her basement or at Deseret Industries or received from neighbors wanting to get rid of stuff—from rat traps to aprons, from old drapes to kazoos. While I was in Africa she sent me a Tupperware catalogue, saying that she thought it’d be nice for the sisters out in the bush to have a Tupperware party. We <i>can</i> pass along joy and good cheer—and a good sense of humor—to our children and others.</p>
<p>President James E. Faust commented:</p>
<p><i>For many years as I have blessed newborn children, including my own, I have blessed them with a sense of humor. I do this with the hope that it will help guard them against being too rigid, that they will have balance in their lives, and that situations and problems and difficulties will not be overdrawn. </i>[“The Need for Balance in Our Lives,” <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000, 4]</p>
<p>A mother who was diagnosed with cancer told of being isolated in a bare room for many long days behind closed lead-lined doors, feeling like a prisoner convicted of a crime she didn’t commit. Then she tells of her oldest daughter coming to visit:</p>
<p><i>She sat down behind the lead screen that separated us and proceeded to take off her boots and socks. She slipped her socks on her hands and pretended they were puppets and spoke through them. I laughed for the first time in months. That simple act brightened my outlook instantly.</i> [Emily Farmer, “‘What Do I Say to Someone Who Is Dying?’” <i>Ensign,</i> April 1990, 73]</p>
<p>“Count your many blessings, name them one by one”—you never know when one might be missing! Gratitude leads to joy and happiness, just as joy and happiness lead to gratitude and contentment. President Lorenzo Snow said, “It is . . . the duty of every Latter-day Saint to cultivate a spirit of gratitude” (quoted in Rulon D. Pope, “Free-Riding and Gratitude,” <i>Brigham Young University 1999–2000 Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University: 2000], 102).</p>
<h2><b>Heavenly Father Wants Us to Be Happy</b></h2>
<p>Our Heavenly Father and the Savior want us to experience joy, happiness, and good cheer. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, “ I am satisfied that our Father in Heaven likes to see His children happy—not miserable, but happy” (<i>TGBH,</i> 256). A <i>Church News</i> article states: “Some unfortunate souls think that joy is a luxury, one of life’s frills they cannot afford or do not deserve. But . . . it is God who decided that joy is the very purpose for our existence” (“Choosing Joy,” <i>Church News,</i> 6 February 1993, 16). His plan really <i>is</i> the great plan of happiness!</p>
<p>Elder Matthew Cowley commented:</p>
<p><i>I like to get fun out of this business—good, wholesome, righteous fun—get a kick out of it. When I obey the principles of this gospel, I am the happiest man on earth. When I don’t, then I am depressed, then I have a right to worry about myself; but, when I am trying to do the best I know, then I tell you, I am having the time of my life. </i>[<i>Matthew Cowley Speaks</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1954), 133]</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: “Ultimate hope and daily grumpiness are not reconcilable. It is ungraceful, unjustified, and unbecoming of us as committed Church members to be constantly grumpy or of woeful countenance” (<i>Neal A. Maxwell Quote Book</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], 164).</p>
<p>President Hinckley has several quotes on this topic in the collection of his teachings: “It is very important to be happy in this work. We have a lot of gloomy people in the Church because they do not understand, I guess, that this is the gospel of happiness. It is something to be happy about, to get excited about” (<i>TGBH, </i>256); “I hope you enjoy this work. I really do. Notwithstanding all the problems, this is a work of happiness. This is the good news! This is a work of joy! I hope you can laugh and smile and be happy and rejoice before the Lord” (<i>TGBH,</i> 255); “Your happiness lies in following the gospel of Jesus Christ. . . . Happiness lies in faithfulness and in righteousness” (<i>TGBH,</i> 256). That’s it! That’s the key! Our happiness lies in following the gospel of Jesus Christ—in having faith in Him, believing Him, coming unto Him, and becoming more like Him.</p>
<p>May our deep and tender feelings about the Savior bring us comfort, peace, hope, joy, gratitude, contentment, optimism, a countenance of divine cheerfulness, and genuine happiness. He is the one who invites us to “be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you” (D&amp;C 68:6).</p>
<p>He will. He does. I know it.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in ­general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question “What lack I yet?” and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, “Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer.”
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to “be more cheerful” or to “smile more often” or to “count their blessings.”
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happi­ness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing “an unconscious smile.”1 I have known people like that—­individuals who are continually smiling ­without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being “temple worthy,” what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day—and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet—and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to “thank the Lord thy God in all things” (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (Children’s Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song—“hear[ing] the song of a bird,” “look[ing] at the blue . . . sky,” having eyes to “see The color of butterfly wings,” and feeling “the wind as it rushes by.” Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, “What is a SWKT?” I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges—including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. [“Stories of the Century,” comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 1999–2000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lee’s memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the student’s tuition. . . .

It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn “Count Your Blessings.” I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; ev’ry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact—not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: “I can live for two months on a good compliment.”3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift—from friends, from family, from God—and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change people’s lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles—500 of it on foot. I’m not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I don’t believe I’ve ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lord’s hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries—our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease—we sometimes forget to confess the Lord’s hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimball’s statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Let’s take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
