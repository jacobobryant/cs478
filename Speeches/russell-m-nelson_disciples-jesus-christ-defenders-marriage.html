  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you, President Worthen, for your gracious introduction. Wendy and I are grateful for the privilege of being here on this significant occasion. I bring love and greetings from President Thomas S. Monson, President Henry B. Eyring, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, my beloved Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and members of the board of trustees.

We are grateful for President Kevin J Worthen and President Cecil O. Samuelson, who have presided over the studies of this graduating class. We thank the faculty and staff for their service and tireless striving for excellence. And today we congratulate every graduate, along with their families and friends who have provided encouragement along the way. We are very proud of each of you!

Some of you will continue your education and achieve graduate degrees. Some of you will enter the workforce on a full-time basis. Many of you have married or will marry and begin your families. Family life will provide your most enduring rewards. As partners, you and your spouse will work together to achieve mutual goals and enjoy the fruits of your labors. By the way, brethren, you might bear this in mind: Behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in-law. I know mine was!

There is great power in a strong partnership. True partners can achieve more than the sum of each acting alone. With true partners, one plus one is much more than two. For example, Dr. Will Mayo and his brother, Dr. Charles Mayo, formed the Mayo Clinic. Lawyers and others form important partnerships. And in marriage, a husband and wife can form the most significant partnership of all - an eternal family.

Sustainable improvements in any endeavor depend on collaboration and agreement. Great leaders and partners develop the skill of sharing insights and efforts and the pattern of building consensus. Great partners are completely loyal. They suppress personal ego in exchange for being part of creating something larger than themselves. Great partnerships are dependent upon each individual developing his or her own personal attributes of character.

Each of us was born as an individual and is educated as an individual. You have passed tests to meet standards imposed upon you by someone else. You have been jumping over educational high hurdles, all erected by other people. For years you have been primarily task-oriented, preparing for what you want &lt;i&gt;to do&lt;/i&gt; in life.

That is essential. But now it is time for a significant shift. Now it is time for you to define your own goals and meet your own expectations. From now on, you decide! Instead of concentrating on what you are &lt;i&gt;to do,&lt;/i&gt; now is the time to zero in on who you are &lt;i&gt;to be - &lt;/i&gt;on that person you are yet &lt;i&gt;to become,&lt;/i&gt; as President Worthen explained so well. Now is the time for you to focus on developing great attributes of character.

Now seems to be my time for attending funerals. I have witnessed many families saying good-bye, for a season, to those they love and to whom they are sealed. I often leave funerals wondering, "What would I like to have said about me at my funeral?"

It is not too early in your life to ask the same question. What would you like to have said about you at your funeral? Hopefully that you were a good husband and father or a good wife and mother.

That you were a person of integrity.

That you were kind and patient.

Or humble and hardworking.

Or a person of virtue.

The greatest guardians of any and all virtues are marriage and family. This is particularly the case with the virtues of chastity and fidelity in marriage, both of which are required to create enduring and fully rewarding marriage partnerships and family relationships.

Male and female are created for what they can do and become, together. It takes a man and a woman to bring a child into the world. Mothers and fathers are not interchangeable. Men and women are distinct and complementary. Children deserve a chance to grow up with both a mom and a dad.

As you go forth from BYU, you will likely encounter increasing debate about the definition of marriage. Many of your neighbors, colleagues, and friends will have never heard logical and inspired truths about the importance of marriage as God Himself defined it. You will have many opportunities to strengthen understanding of the Lords side of that argument by the eloquence of your examples, both as individuals and as families.

The Apostle Paul foresaw our circumstances when he said:

&lt;i&gt;In the last days perilous times shall come.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, . . . despisers of those that are good, &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. &lt;/i&gt;

Then he concluded, "From such turn away."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

After his remarkable prophecy of our time, Paul added this word of warning:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Ponder that! It means that during these perilous times, life will not be comfortable for true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we will have His approval. He gave us this assurance:

&lt;i&gt;And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my names sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

In short, as disciples, each of us will be put to the test. At any hour of any day we have the privilege of choosing between right and wrong. This is an age-old battle that started in a premortal realm. And that battle is becoming more intense every day. Your individual strength of character is needed now more than ever before.

The day is gone when you can be a quiet and comfortable Christian. Your religion is not just about showing up for church on Sunday. It is about showing up as a true disciple from Sunday morning through Saturday night - 24/7! There is no such thing as a "part-time" disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus invited anyone who wants to be His disciple to take up His cross and follow Him.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Are you ready to join the ranks?

Or will you be ashamed of the gospel? Will you be ashamed of your Lord and His plan?&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Will you yield to voices of those who would have you join them on the popular side of contemporary history?

No! The youth of Zion will not falter! I believe you will be courageous and proclaim Gods truth with clarity and kindness, even when His truth is politically unpopular! Paul set that pattern when he declared:

&lt;i&gt;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Disciples of the Lord are defenders of marriage. We cannot yield. History is not our judge. A secular society is not our judge. God is our judge! For each of us, Judgment Day will be held in Gods own way and time.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

The future of marriage and of countless human lives will be determined by your willingness to bear solemn witness of the Lord and live according to His gospel. Great protection is available to us as we enter the waters of baptism and take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. King Benjamin so explained:

&lt;i&gt;And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

I appreciate a statement made by Sister Sheri L. Dew at the recent BYU Womens Conference. She said:

&lt;i&gt;At the heart of becoming disciples is &lt;b&gt;doing&lt;/b&gt; what we promise to do every time we partake of the sacrament - which is to "always remember" the Lord (see Moroni 4:3; 5:2). This means remembering Him when we choose what media were willing to expose our spirits to. It means remembering Him in how we spend our time and when choosing between a steady diet of pop culture or the Word of God. It means remembering Him in the middle of conflict or when temptation looms. It means remembering Him when critics attack His Church and mock truth. It means remembering that we have taken His name upon us (Mosiah 5:7).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

Sister Dews message is consonant with a message from President Howard W. Hunter (19071995), who said:

&lt;i&gt;If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. . . . If our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/howard-w-hunter_fear-little-flock/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Wherever we go, you and I as disciples of the Lord bear a solemn responsibility to proclaim the will of God to all people. And one of the more demanding opportunities of our time is to stand up for the truth regarding the sacred nature of marriage.

Our message is shaped by divine doctrine, canonized in the Bible:

&lt;i&gt;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And God blessed them, and . . . said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Adam called his wifes name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

God is the Father of all men and women. They are His children. It was He who ordained marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Marriage was not created by human judges or legislators. It was not created by think tanks or by popular vote or by oft-quoted bloggers or by pundits. It was not created by lobbyists. Marriage was created by God!

The Ten Commandments forbade adultery and covetousness.16 Those ancient commandments were given later to people of New Testament&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; and Book of Mormon&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; times. In modern revelation the Lord has reaffirmed:

&lt;i&gt;Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

True intimacy, as planned by our Creator, is experienced only within the sacred union of a husband and wife because it is enriched by truth and ennobled by the honoring of covenants a husband and wife make with each other and with God. It is crucial to note that full fidelity to those covenants forbids pornography, lust, or abuse in any form.

Social and political pressures to change marriage laws are resulting in practices contrary to Gods will regarding the eternal nature and purposes of marriage. Man simply cannot make moral what God has declared to be immoral. Sin, even if legalized by man, is still sin in the eyes of God.

Brothers and sisters, undergirded by incontrovertible truth, proclaim your love for God! Proclaim your love for all human beings "with malice toward none, with charity for all."&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; They as children of God are our brothers and sisters. We value their rights and feelings. But we cannot condone efforts to change divine doctrine. It is not for man to change.

God loves His children. And if they love Him, they will show that love by keeping His commandments,&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; including chastity before marriage and total fidelity within marriage. Scriptures warn that behavior contrary to the commandments of the Lord will not only deprive couples of divinely approved intimacy but will bring about the stern judgments of God.&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

The noblest yearning of the human heart is for a marriage that will endure beyond death. Complete fidelity to covenants made in holy temples will allow husband and wife to be sealed together throughout all eternity.&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;

Dear graduates, families, and friends, the burden of discipleship is heavy. As disciples of the Lord you will stand as defenders of marriage. And as you are true and faithful, not only will He help you and protect you,&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; He will bless your families.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

You are beneficiaries of the infinite Atonement of the Lord. Because of Him all of you will eventually be rewarded with immortality. And because of Him you may enjoy the blessing of eternal life with Him and your families.

Now, invoking the keys of the holy apostleship in me vested, I bless you with a fervent desire to feast on the words of Jesus Christ and to apply His teachings in your daily lives. I bless you with success in your continuing educational and occupational pursuits. I bless you with joy as you keep the commandments of Almighty God. And I bless you with protection, peace, and continual growth as you stand as disciples and defenders of the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel.

God lives! Jesus is the Christ! He stands as the Head of His Church, restored in these latter days to accomplish its divine destiny. I so testify, with my expression of love and gratitude for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Thank you, President Worthen, for your gracious introduction. Wendy and I are grateful for the privilege of being here on this significant occasion. I bring love and greetings from President Thomas S. Monson, President Henry B. Eyring, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, my beloved Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and members of the board of trustees.</p>
<p>We are grateful for President Kevin J Worthen and President Cecil O. Samuelson, who have presided over the studies of this graduating class. We thank the faculty and staff for their service and tireless striving for excellence. And today we congratulate every graduate, along with their families and friends who have provided encouragement along the way. We are very proud of each of you!</p>
<p>Some of you will continue your education and achieve graduate degrees. Some of you will enter the workforce on a full-time basis. Many of you have married or will marry and begin your families. Family life will provide your most enduring rewards. As partners, you and your spouse will work together to achieve mutual goals and enjoy the fruits of your labors. By the way, brethren, you might bear this in mind: Behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in-law. I know mine was!</p>
<p>There is great power in a strong partnership. True partners can achieve more than the sum of each acting alone. With true partners, one plus one is much more than two. For example, Dr. Will Mayo and his brother, Dr. Charles Mayo, formed the Mayo Clinic. Lawyers and others form important partnerships. And in marriage, a husband and wife can form the most significant partnership of all - an eternal family.</p>
<p>Sustainable improvements in any endeavor depend on collaboration and agreement. Great leaders and partners develop the skill of sharing insights and efforts and the pattern of building consensus. Great partners are completely loyal. They suppress personal ego in exchange for being part of creating something larger than themselves. Great partnerships are dependent upon each individual developing his or her own personal attributes of character.</p>
<p>Each of us was born as an individual and is educated as an individual. You have passed tests to meet standards imposed upon you by someone else. You have been jumping over educational high hurdles, all erected by other people. For years you have been primarily task-oriented, preparing for what you want <i>to do</i> in life.</p>
<p>That is essential. But now it is time for a significant shift. Now it is time for you to define your own goals and meet your own expectations. From now on, you decide! Instead of concentrating on what you are <i>to do,</i> now is the time to zero in on who you are <i>to be - </i>on that person you are yet <i>to become,</i> as President Worthen explained so well. Now is the time for you to focus on developing great attributes of character.</p>
<p>Now seems to be my time for attending funerals. I have witnessed many families saying good-bye, for a season, to those they love and to whom they are sealed. I often leave funerals wondering, "What would I like to have said about me at my funeral?"</p>
<p>It is not too early in your life to ask the same question. What would you like to have said about you at your funeral? Hopefully that you were a good husband and father or a good wife and mother.</p>
<p>That you were a person of integrity.</p>
<p>That you were kind and patient.</p>
<p>Or humble and hardworking.</p>
<p>Or a person of virtue.</p>
<p>The greatest guardians of any and all virtues are marriage and family. This is particularly the case with the virtues of chastity and fidelity in marriage, both of which are required to create enduring and fully rewarding marriage partnerships and family relationships.</p>
<p>Male and female are created for what they can do and become, together. It takes a man and a woman to bring a child into the world. Mothers and fathers are not interchangeable. Men and women are distinct and complementary. Children deserve a chance to grow up with both a mom and a dad.</p>
<p>As you go forth from BYU, you will likely encounter increasing debate about the definition of marriage. Many of your neighbors, colleagues, and friends will have never heard logical and inspired truths about the importance of marriage as God Himself defined it. You will have many opportunities to strengthen understanding of the Lords side of that argument by the eloquence of your examples, both as individuals and as families.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul foresaw our circumstances when he said:</p>
<p><i>In the last days perilous times shall come.</i></p>
<p><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, </i></p>
<p><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, . . . despisers of those that are good, </i></p>
<p><i>. . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. </i></p>
<p>Then he concluded, "From such turn away."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>After his remarkable prophecy of our time, Paul added this word of warning:</p>
<p><i>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Ponder that! It means that during these perilous times, life will not be comfortable for true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we will have His approval. He gave us this assurance:</p>
<p><i>And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my names sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In short, as disciples, each of us will be put to the test. At any hour of any day we have the privilege of choosing between right and wrong. This is an age-old battle that started in a premortal realm. And that battle is becoming more intense every day. Your individual strength of character is needed now more than ever before.</p>
<p>The day is gone when you can be a quiet and comfortable Christian. Your religion is not just about showing up for church on Sunday. It is about showing up as a true disciple from Sunday morning through Saturday night - 24/7! There is no such thing as a "part-time" disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus invited anyone who wants to be His disciple to take up His cross and follow Him.<sup>4</sup> Are you ready to join the ranks?</p>
<p>Or will you be ashamed of the gospel? Will you be ashamed of your Lord and His plan?<sup>5</sup> Will you yield to voices of those who would have you join them on the popular side of contemporary history?</p>
<p>No! The youth of Zion will not falter! I believe you will be courageous and proclaim Gods truth with clarity and kindness, even when His truth is politically unpopular! Paul set that pattern when he declared:</p>
<p><i>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Disciples of the Lord are defenders of marriage. We cannot yield. History is not our judge. A secular society is not our judge. God is our judge! For each of us, Judgment Day will be held in Gods own way and time.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The future of marriage and of countless human lives will be determined by your willingness to bear solemn witness of the Lord and live according to His gospel. Great protection is available to us as we enter the waters of baptism and take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. King Benjamin so explained:</p>
<p><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>I appreciate a statement made by Sister Sheri L. Dew at the recent BYU Womens Conference. She said:</p>
<p><i>At the heart of becoming disciples is <b>doing</b> what we promise to do every time we partake of the sacrament - which is to "always remember" the Lord (see Moroni 4:3; 5:2). This means remembering Him when we choose what media were willing to expose our spirits to. It means remembering Him in how we spend our time and when choosing between a steady diet of pop culture or the Word of God. It means remembering Him in the middle of conflict or when temptation looms. It means remembering Him when critics attack His Church and mock truth. It means remembering that we have taken His name upon us (Mosiah 5:7).</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Sister Dews message is consonant with a message from President Howard W. Hunter (19071995), who said:</p>
<p><i>If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. . . . If our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right. </i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/howard-w-hunter_fear-little-flock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Wherever we go, you and I as disciples of the Lord bear a solemn responsibility to proclaim the will of God to all people. And one of the more demanding opportunities of our time is to stand up for the truth regarding the sacred nature of marriage.</p>
<p>Our message is shaped by divine doctrine, canonized in the Bible:</p>
<p><i>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</i><sup>11</sup></p>
<p><i>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. </i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p><i>And God blessed them, and . . . said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</i><sup>13</sup></p>
<p><i>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. </i><sup>14</sup></p>
<p><i>And Adam called his wifes name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. </i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p>God is the Father of all men and women. They are His children. It was He who ordained marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Marriage was not created by human judges or legislators. It was not created by think tanks or by popular vote or by oft-quoted bloggers or by pundits. It was not created by lobbyists. Marriage was created by God!</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments forbade adultery and covetousness.16 Those ancient commandments were given later to people of New Testament<sup>17</sup> and Book of Mormon<sup>18</sup> times. In modern revelation the Lord has reaffirmed:</p>
<p><i>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</i><sup>19</sup></p>
<p>True intimacy, as planned by our Creator, is experienced only within the sacred union of a husband and wife because it is enriched by truth and ennobled by the honoring of covenants a husband and wife make with each other and with God. It is crucial to note that full fidelity to those covenants forbids pornography, lust, or abuse in any form.</p>
<p>Social and political pressures to change marriage laws are resulting in practices contrary to Gods will regarding the eternal nature and purposes of marriage. Man simply cannot make moral what God has declared to be immoral. Sin, even if legalized by man, is still sin in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, undergirded by incontrovertible truth, proclaim your love for God! Proclaim your love for all human beings "with malice toward none, with charity for all."<sup>20</sup> They as children of God are our brothers and sisters. We value their rights and feelings. But we cannot condone efforts to change divine doctrine. It is not for man to change.</p>
<p>God loves His children. And if they love Him, they will show that love by keeping His commandments,<sup>21</sup> including chastity before marriage and total fidelity within marriage. Scriptures warn that behavior contrary to the commandments of the Lord will not only deprive couples of divinely approved intimacy but will bring about the stern judgments of God.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>The noblest yearning of the human heart is for a marriage that will endure beyond death. Complete fidelity to covenants made in holy temples will allow husband and wife to be sealed together throughout all eternity.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Dear graduates, families, and friends, the burden of discipleship is heavy. As disciples of the Lord you will stand as defenders of marriage. And as you are true and faithful, not only will He help you and protect you,<sup>24</sup> He will bless your families.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>You are beneficiaries of the infinite Atonement of the Lord. Because of Him all of you will eventually be rewarded with immortality. And because of Him you may enjoy the blessing of eternal life with Him and your families.</p>
<p>Now, invoking the keys of the holy apostleship in me vested, I bless you with a fervent desire to feast on the words of Jesus Christ and to apply His teachings in your daily lives. I bless you with success in your continuing educational and occupational pursuits. I bless you with joy as you keep the commandments of Almighty God. And I bless you with protection, peace, and continual growth as you stand as disciples and defenders of the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel.</p>
<p>God lives! Jesus is the Christ! He stands as the Head of His Church, restored in these latter days to accomplish its divine destiny. I so testify, with my expression of love and gratitude for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It may not surprise you, but I want to declare at the outset that I have been multiply blessed. I want to initially mention an important blessing - this university - and then I would like to dwell on a forty-one-year blessing - my marriage. Those who have received this award in past years have stood here to express their gratitude to BYU, but I feel especially blessed in receiving this award as a non-Mormon. This university has insisted on valuing me regardless of my religious minority status. I am a religious "other," yet this university has not only accepted me as a colleague and a friend but also persisted in recognizing me and celebrating my work. I think this is a sort of minor miracle. As you will see in the case of my wife, I honestly believe that when we truly value and even love those who are "other" in some way, God is there.1
I also want to acknowledge how important this university has been to my academic work. I have long desired to actively interface the sacred and the secular - the sacredness of my faith and the secularity of my discipline of psychology - but there are few places that permit this work. BYU, however, has not only welcomed this type of scholarship but also encouraged and facilitated it. For this reason, I have never had to compartmentalize my Christianity away from my discipline; I have been able to integrate the two - which has been an incredible blessing to me!
As I mentioned, however, the blessing I want to dwell on today is the love I feel for my wife. But discussing such a personal experience may seem a bit strange for a psychologist. Psychologists are supposed to deal with objective data.2 Unfortunately, love isnt objective, so psychologys knowledge of love has been meager over the years. Consider renowned love researcher Harry Harlow and his lament in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association:
So far as love or affection is concerned, psychologists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple observation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.3
This conclusion was stated many years ago, but it is not unusual for even modern investigators of love to echo Harlows lament. Zick Rubin, for example, believes that some progress has been made, but he comments that love has "seemed safely beyond the research scientists ever-extending grasp."4
I wont get into psychological methods here. Suffice it to say that a relatively new brand of psychological method - qualitative investigation - was specifically set up to study subjective experiences. And qualitative investigators are not afraid of even just one persons experiences, especially when those personal experiences teach us something about the phenomenon of interest.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have prayerfully prepared a message designed to bring you peace and happiness in a troubled world. I know that the truths it contains provide solutions because my precious wife, Jeanene, and I have proven their worth in our own lives.
For you to obtain the maximum benefit from our time together, I suggest that you carefully write down any impressions that come to you. They are personalized messages from the Lord sent through the Holy Ghost for your guidance.
Temple Ordinances Strengthen the Family and the Home
Two of the vital pillars that sustain Father in Heavens plan of happiness are the family and the home. Their lofty significance is underscored by Satans relentless efforts to splinter the family and to undermine the significance of temple ordinances, which bind the family together for eternity. He does this by constant encouragement to promote promiscuity and to defile the sacred, intimate expression of love between a husband and wife that results in the birth of children.
Fifty-seven years ago, on July 16, 1953, my beloved Jeanene and I knelt as a young couple at an altar in the Manti Utah Temple. President Lewis R. Anderson exercised the sealing authority and pronounced us husband and wife, wedded for time and for all eternity. I have no power to describe the peace and serenity that come from the assurance that, as I continue to live to qualify, I will be able to be with my beloved Jeanene and our obedient children forever because of that sacred ordinance performed with the proper priesthood authority in a house of the Lord.
Our seven children are bound to us by the sacred ordinances of the temple. My precious wife, Jeanene, and two of our children are beyond the veil. They provide a powerful motivation for each remaining member of our family to live so that together we can receive all of the eternal blessings promised in the temple.
The sealing in the temple has greater meaning as life unfolds and you discover the beauty of the differing characteristics between you, your spouse, and your children. You can share your love for each other and your gratitude for the blessing of being together. You can draw ever closer together and find greater fulfillment in mortality.
When my wife was carrying our third child, our second child was severely ill. Jeanene would hold him on her lap while they did fluoroscopic examinations. She received excessive radiation, and as a result she was unable to have additional children, and the one that she was carrying passed away prematurely. But we have them. They were born to us in the covenant. That is the blessing of the ordinances of the temple. Even though this mortal probation was for different lengths, those who were sealed to us with the holy priesthood through the ordinances of the holy temple will be ours for forever.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When couples get married, their love is deep, and they joyfully anticipate the prospect of spending the eternities together. They enjoy having endless talks, going for long walks, and spending time together. It is a wonderful feeling being with someone you love so deeply.
Unfortunately, for many couples the bliss of deep love and immensely satisfying companionship that was present when they first got married doesnt last. Long talks become replaced with frequent arguments, and when not spent fighting, their time together is characterized by angry silence.
Many of these couples divorce. Others manage the hostility by emotionally withdrawing from the relationship. The spouses become distant from each other, and they keep their interaction to a minimum. President Spencer W. Kimball described these couples when he said:
There are many people who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end their marriages, but who have permitted their marriage to grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouses who . . . are in the low state of mere joint occupancy of the home. [In Marriage (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 4446; adapted from Kimball, "Marriage and Divorce," BYU devotional address, 7 September 1976]
How do these couples go from ecstatic levels of love and happiness to frequent conflict, bitterness, and, in many cases, eventual divorce?
A number of reasons have been identified by researchers, but lately Ive been thinking that most of these reasons can be boiled down to two fundamental factors: a lack of repentance and a lack of forgiveness.
It is important to note that these principles of repentance and forgiveness apply to all relationships, not just to marriage. They apply to roommates, family members, and colleagues at work. So, no matter what ones marital status is or what the prospects in the near future are, these principles are important to all of us.
In most cases we are married for only a short time before we hurt our spouses feelings. Whether it is intentional, based on selfishness, or just inadvertent mistakes, we all end up doing things that create hurt in our spouse.
The remedy is pretty straightforward. We say, "Im sorry." We feel badly that we hurt our spouse, apologize, learn from the experience, and do our best not to make the same mistake again. We repent, and, assuming that the problem wasnt too major, the issue is over.
Elder Joe J. Christensen said:
To develop a solid marriage, we must be able to admit we are sorry for the mistakes we make. . . . When conflicts in marriage arise, we should be swift to apologize and ask for forgiveness, even though we may not be totally at fault. True love is developed by those who are willing to readily admit personal mistakes and offenses. [One Step a</span>
