  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;p&gt;What an awesome sight! What a remarkable collection of personal accomplishment your presence here today represents! What a memorable feeling! I thank the university for the privilege I have to be here to share it with you. For you and your families, this is clearly a high point of your lives.
&lt;p&gt;Events of a few years ago helped me gain an appreciation for the high points of my life. My oldest daughter, her fiance, and I decided to climb Mount Rainier. It was something I had thought about often as a young kid growing up in Washington State, where I could always see this snow-capped mountain at the end of the valley where my family lived.
&lt;p&gt;Mount Rainier stands just over 14,400 feet. It is a serious climb that ascends nearly two vertical miles and, for someone like me, requires serious conditioning. After climbing all day on the first day, we arrived dead tired at Camp Muir, which lies at an elevation of 10,000 feet. We ate and then fell asleep. Our guide woke up us at one oclock in the morning to begin the climb to the summit. From Camp Muir we headed out across the Cowlitz Glacier with our crampons strapped to our boots and each of us connected to the person in front of us by rope just in case someone slipped on the steep, ice-covered glacier.
&lt;p&gt;As we climbed, I became aware of how dependent we were on our guide to show us where to go to avoid the crevasses and other dangers and pitfalls. I was struck by the fact that every vertical step I took was into a foothold that someone who had gone before had carved out of the ice. We quickly fell into a routine of climbing for 50 minutes and resting for 10. The climb was amazing. It was a clear night with a full moon and a view of unspeakable beauty.
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of climbing, we reached our next rest stop at the top of what is ironically called Disappointment Cleaver. Our guide went to each climber and asked us this question: "Is this your high point?" His question struck me. I knew it was a nice way of asking if that was as high as I thought I could go. But I also remember feeling the distinct impression that as exciting and thrilling as the climb was, I could not count it as a high point in my life. That impression was validated just a few months later at the marriage of that same daughter. Surrounded by family and friends, appreciating what really matters in this life, I remember thinking and telling my daughter, "This is my high point."
&lt;p&gt;Today marks the beginning, or "commencement," of what will be many high points in your life. I am grateful that my time here at Brigham Young University helped me understand the metric by which I could measure the high points in my life. It is the standard that is laid out in the mission of the university, which is "to assist individuals in their &lt;i&gt;quest for perfection and eternal life"&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;The Mission of Brigham Young University&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Aims of a BYU Education&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: BYU, 1996], 1; emphasis added) and to help them become people "of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives" (&lt;i&gt;Mission&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; Aims&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).
&lt;p&gt;That is a pretty high standard. As students of Brigham Young University today, you join a great alumni family of men and women now 370,000 strong throughout the world who share this mission - 370,000 who have gone before you carving out footsteps to make your journey through life easier, 370,000 fellow alumni sharing a connection and a commitment to accomplish great things in life.
&lt;p&gt;At the BYU Alumni Association, we believe that our ability to accomplish great things in life can be magnified when we connect with others who share the Spirit of the Y. We are dedicated to cultivate the Spirit of the Y by keeping you informed and connected to the good works that faculty and alumni are doing in the world and providing opportunities for you to learn, volunteer, contribute, and serve with the students, programs, and activities of your alma mater - keeping you "connected for good."
&lt;p&gt;We feel so strongly about this idea of being connected for good that we have adopted it as the slogan of the Alumni Association. No longer students, we will remain connected as alumni with a shared commitment to go forth to do good in a world that has now become our campus.
&lt;p&gt;As president of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association Board of Directors, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Congratulations!
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to continue to let the mission of BYU guide you to the high points in your life. Let that mission continue to lift and inspire you. Find ways you can be "connected for good"&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and receive the blessings that come to those who continue to learn and serve others throughout their lives. May God bless you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Dee T. Allsop was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 13 August 2009.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>What an awesome sight! What a remarkable collection of personal accomplishment your presence here today represents! What a memorable feeling! I thank the university for the privilege I have to be here to share it with you. For you and your families, this is clearly a high point of your lives.</p>
<p>Events of a few years ago helped me gain an appreciation for the high points of my life. My oldest daughter, her fiance, and I decided to climb Mount Rainier. It was something I had thought about often as a young kid growing up in Washington State, where I could always see this snow-capped mountain at the end of the valley where my family lived.</p>
<p>Mount Rainier stands just over 14,400 feet. It is a serious climb that ascends nearly two vertical miles and, for someone like me, requires serious conditioning. After climbing all day on the first day, we arrived dead tired at Camp Muir, which lies at an elevation of 10,000 feet. We ate and then fell asleep. Our guide woke up us at one oclock in the morning to begin the climb to the summit. From Camp Muir we headed out across the Cowlitz Glacier with our crampons strapped to our boots and each of us connected to the person in front of us by rope just in case someone slipped on the steep, ice-covered glacier.</p>
<p>As we climbed, I became aware of how dependent we were on our guide to show us where to go to avoid the crevasses and other dangers and pitfalls. I was struck by the fact that every vertical step I took was into a foothold that someone who had gone before had carved out of the ice. We quickly fell into a routine of climbing for 50 minutes and resting for 10. The climb was amazing. It was a clear night with a full moon and a view of unspeakable beauty.</p>
<p>After a few hours of climbing, we reached our next rest stop at the top of what is ironically called Disappointment Cleaver. Our guide went to each climber and asked us this question: "Is this your high point?" His question struck me. I knew it was a nice way of asking if that was as high as I thought I could go. But I also remember feeling the distinct impression that as exciting and thrilling as the climb was, I could not count it as a high point in my life. That impression was validated just a few months later at the marriage of that same daughter. Surrounded by family and friends, appreciating what really matters in this life, I remember thinking and telling my daughter, "This is my high point."</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning, or "commencement," of what will be many high points in your life. I am grateful that my time here at Brigham Young University helped me understand the metric by which I could measure the high points in my life. It is the standard that is laid out in the mission of the university, which is "to assist individuals in their <i>quest for perfection and eternal life"</i> (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 1; emphasis added) and to help them become people "of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives" (<i>Mission</i> and<i> Aims</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).</p>
<p>That is a pretty high standard. As students of Brigham Young University today, you join a great alumni family of men and women now 370,000 strong throughout the world who share this mission - 370,000 who have gone before you carving out footsteps to make your journey through life easier, 370,000 fellow alumni sharing a connection and a commitment to accomplish great things in life.</p>
<p>At the BYU Alumni Association, we believe that our ability to accomplish great things in life can be magnified when we connect with others who share the Spirit of the Y. We are dedicated to cultivate the Spirit of the Y by keeping you informed and connected to the good works that faculty and alumni are doing in the world and providing opportunities for you to learn, volunteer, contribute, and serve with the students, programs, and activities of your alma mater - keeping you "connected for good."</p>
<p>We feel so strongly about this idea of being connected for good that we have adopted it as the slogan of the Alumni Association. No longer students, we will remain connected as alumni with a shared commitment to go forth to do good in a world that has now become our campus.</p>
<p>As president of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association Board of Directors, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Congratulations!</p>
<p>I invite you to continue to let the mission of BYU guide you to the high points in your life. Let that mission continue to lift and inspire you. Find ways you can be "connected for good"<i> </i>and receive the blessings that come to those who continue to learn and serve others throughout their lives. May God bless you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><i>Dee T. Allsop was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 13 August 2009.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with antiVietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building" (I hope) and a preparation for "(4) lifelong learning and service."1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, "Can we do that?"
She responded quizzically, "You do know this is a Church school, dont you?"
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline "Remember when; remember why." We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelors degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: "Be awful." Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. "Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations"2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the thirteenth century the word silly meant "worthy, good," and "pious, holy."3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to "innocent" or "harmless," then to "deserving of pity or sympathy," to "weak/feeble," then to "ignorant." By the sixteenth century it had descended to "foolish," its current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was "awe-inspiring," "worthy of . . . respect," and "profoundly respectful or reverential."5 But as one author explained, "Since what inspires awe isnt always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative."6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean "terrible, dreadful, appalling"; something not just bad but "exceedingly bad."7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense - that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
"Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast - in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc. - that we struggle to comprehend it."8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses "greatly marvel</span>
