  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Some months ago, when I was invited to speak today, I asked what I should talk about. After a long pause the voice said, "Well, people usually talk about things theyre good at." So my topic today is conflict.

I used to think other people had conflicts but that I was immune. Then I came upon two incidents in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith that completely changed my understanding of conflicts and forced me to admit I probably have as many as anybody else.

What is a conflict? For our purposes today, a conflict is any situation in which both sides feel the other is in the wrong.

Ill begin with seven propositions about conflicts.

1. It is strange, but unless we had a conflict in the last few hours, most of us dont remember our conflicts. This may be good, because it saves us pain, but it creates a problem. If we dont remember our conflicts, we cant learn anything from them.

2. We probably experience conflicts differently - depending on our personalities, our prior experiences (such as the way conflicts were handled in the home where we grew up), and perhaps other factors such as gender and culture.

3. In Mormon culture most people are conflict avoiders. However, some of us are neutral about conflict, and some of us actually enjoy a good conflict.

4. If we are in relationships with others, there will be conflicts. They may be small or they may be large, but there will surely be conflicts. Can you think of any conflicts in your life right now? Perhaps a few hints will help. If you do think of a conflict or two, I hope you will jot them down.

a. Conflicts with family, such as father, mother, siblings, spouse, children, or in-laws.

b. Conflicts with people you see often who are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; family: neighbors, landlords, merchants, even people at church. President Brigham Young summed it up in rhyme:

&lt;i&gt;To live with Saints in Heaven is bliss and glory&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To live with Saints on Earth is another story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

5. It takes two sides to create a conflict. More important, there is almost always fault on &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; sides. As someone said, "Its a mighty thin pancake that only has one side."

6. During a conflict we are usually blind to our own fault and we blame the other side.

7. A final proposition introduces my theme. When we remember our conflicts and reflect on them, they are like mirrors that can teach us things about ourselves that are otherwise difficult to discover. If we permit them, our conflicts will show us where we are weak, defensive, prideful, or otherwise in need of repair.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Ill illustrate the value of conflicts with three examples. Two are from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These both involve Oliver Cowdery, who, at the time, was Josephs most trusted associate. These conflicts occurred very close to each other in the summer of 1830, just after the Church was organized. Joseph was 24 years old, and Oliver was 23.

Joseph was busy copying and arranging revelations for publication. Oliver was staying with the Whitmer family in Fayette, 80 miles to the north. Out of the blue, Joseph received a letter from Oliver.

Joseph recorded:

[Oliver] &lt;i&gt;wrote to inform me that he had discovered an error in one of the commandments - Book of Doctrine and Covenants: "And truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins"&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 20:37].

&lt;i&gt;The above quotation,&lt;/i&gt; [Oliver] &lt;i&gt;said, was erroneous, and added: "I command you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"&lt;/i&gt;

The Prophet continued:

&lt;i&gt;I immediately wrote to him in reply, in which I asked him by what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Doctrinally, Oliver was wrong and Joseph was right. But knowing that doesnt solve the problem. These two trusted friends were now in a conflict - both felt the other was in the wrong. The doctrinal issue could be solved, but what about the bad feelings that had arisen between them?

Realizing his letter had not really answered the doctrinal question and had made the interpersonal problem worse, Joseph traveled 80 miles to the Whitmer home to meet with Oliver and the Whitmers.

Joseph reported:

&lt;i&gt;I found the&lt;/i&gt; [Whitmer] &lt;i&gt;family in general of&lt;/i&gt; [Olivers] &lt;i&gt;opinion concerning the words above quoted, and it was not without both labor and perseverance that I could prevail with any of them to reason calmly on the subject. . . . Finally, with&lt;/i&gt; [Christian Whitmers] &lt;i&gt;assistance, I succeeded in bringing, not only the Whitmer family, but also Oliver Cowdery to acknowledge that they had been in error, and that the sentence in dispute was in accordance with the rest of the commandment.&lt;/i&gt;

Joseph then reflected on what he learned from this experience. His conclusions are the centerpiece of my message today:

&lt;i&gt;And thus was this error rooted out, which having its rise in presumption and rash judgment, was . . . particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Judging from his emphasis on humility and meekness, Joseph was commenting not only on Olivers doctrinal error but also on the interpersonal conflict between them and, I think, on the nature of conflicts in general. With prophetic insight he taught two important lessons. His first point was that conflicts arise "in presumption and rash judgment." &lt;i&gt;Presumptuous&lt;/i&gt; means overconfident or even offensive. &lt;i&gt;Rash&lt;/i&gt; means hasty or impetuous. With these definitions in mind, let us look again at Olivers message to Joseph. He said: "I command you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Do you see any ways in which Olivers statement might be considered rash or presumptuous? Certainly commanding another person risks being offensive, especially if it is your ecclesiastical leader. Commanding "in the name of God" would raise offensiveness a degree or two. Accusing your leader of priestcraft would undoubtedly qualify.

I move to the next statement with trepidation, but Joseph invited us to consider the effect of his reply as well. Joseph "immediately wrote to [Oliver]," asking: "By what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God."

Are there ways in which Josephs words might have lacked "humility and meekness"? At a minimum he might have responded with a comment and a question such as, "Oliver, I love you and I value your opinion. Would you help me understand your objection to this passage?"

Josephs second point added power to the first. He concluded that "[conflicts are] particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us."

Three ideas stand out in this statement. First, conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something. Second, we cant learn from them until they are fairly understood, until we can see both sides - meaning we need to cool off before we can learn from them. Third, in a marvelous illustration of his own humility, Joseph included himself as one who learned something important from this conflict.

If our conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something, what are we supposed to learn? Josephs answer goes deep: Conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us "the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways."

Why did Joseph say humility "before the Lord"? Why didnt he say "before the person on the other side"? To learn from our conflicts we must be willing to see our own faults, and we need the Lords help to do that. Only then can He begin to "teach us of &lt;i&gt;His&lt;/i&gt; ways" (emphasis added).

We come to the ultimate question: What &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the Lords ways for dealing with conflict? They are illustrated in a second conflict between Joseph and Oliver.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Just a month after the first conflict, to escape persecution, Joseph and Emma moved 80 miles north to the Whitmer home in Fayette - the home Joseph had so recently visited to resolve the first conflict. Arriving at the Whitmer home, Joseph was grieved to learn that Hiram Page, one of the eight witnesses to the Book of Mormon, had been receiving revelations through a "seer stone" that purported to give instructions on how the Church should operate. Newel Knight was with Joseph, and he described the seriousness of the problem:

[Hiram Page] &lt;i&gt;had managed to get up some dissension of feeling among the brethren by giving revelations concerning the government of the Church . . . , which he claimed to have received through the medium of a stone he possessed. . . . Even Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmer family had given heed to them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

What could have been more painful and frustrating to Joseph than this? If Joseph had followed his earlier pattern, he would have demanded of Hiram Page by what authority he presumed to receive revelations for the Church, and he would have demanded of Oliver what on earth he was thinking to believe in such things. But Joseph was more aware that a hasty and intemperate response would not solve the problem. Joseph knew what &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to do, but he wasnt sure what he &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to do.

Newel Knight wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Joseph was perplexed and scarcely knew how to meet this new exigency. That night I occupied the same room that he did and the greater part of the night was spent in prayer and supplication.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Rather than react defensively, Joseph patiently sought counsel from the Lord. He was soon granted an answer in the form of a revelation, which is now section 28 of the Doctrine and Covenants.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doctrine and Covenants, Section 28&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Section 28 is well known for answering the question of who &lt;i&gt;can - &lt;/i&gt;and who &lt;i&gt;cannot - &lt;/i&gt;receive revelation for the Church. It is also a model of the Lords willingness to see wrongdoers in the larger context of their lives and to show divine confidence in them while reproving or correcting them.

The Lord spoke in the first person directly to Oliver: "Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them . . ." The Lords first words were an affirmation of Olivers good standing in the Lords eyes. Then He added this stipulation: ". . . by the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

After clarifying that only the prophet can receive revelation for the Church, the Lord reaffirmed His divine confidence in Oliver: "And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to &lt;i&gt;speak&lt;/i&gt; . . . by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; And then, again, He outlined the limits on Olivers authority: "But thou shalt not &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; by way of commandment, but by wisdom; And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

The Lord then turned to the source of the problem: Hiram Page. I am struck that He spoke with the same concern for Hirams feelings as He had shown for Olivers. This exemplifies the Lords way, and it makes it much easier for Hiram to accept correction: "Take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

Instructed and corrected in this loving and reaffirming way, both Oliver Cowdery and Hiram Page recognized their error and continued in full fellowship in the Church for a long while.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
These two events in the life of the Prophet Joseph prepare us for one other scriptural example - the painful misunderstanding between Moroni and Pahoran in Alma 59 through 62. I wonder if this is where the Prophet Joseph gained his own understanding that conflicts are meaningful and we must learn from them.

Moroni is one of the great military leaders in all of scripture. At the early age of 25 he was made captain over all the Nephite armies. As you will recall, when the prophet Mormon abridged the records of Moronis military leadership, he called him "a man of a perfect understanding"&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and honored him with this remarkable endorsement:

&lt;i&gt;If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon . . . , and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

It has always astonished me that this same Mormon included, as part of his abridged record, a vivid account of Moronis conflict with Pahoran, the chief judge and governor of the Nephites.

As we learn in Alma 59, Moronis army was caught in a dangerous situation. Lamanite armies were rapidly gaining ground against them. As chief military leader, Moroni wrote Pahoran for reinforcements. Receiving none, the scripture reports, "Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

When no help came from the government, Moroni wrote Pahoran again. He began with the facts: the suffering of his men, the slaughter of thousands of the Nephite people, and other atrocities of war. But Moroni didnt realize that Pahoran had been driven from his throne by the king-men and forced to take refuge in Gideon, and Moroni wrongly accused Pahoran of being a traitor to his own country. Moroni concluded with these challenging words: "Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them."&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

We are treading sacred ground here. Is there any question whether the Lord had inspired Moroni to know there were problems at the government level that called for military help? Not at all. However, in his abridgment, Mormon made it clear that Moroni mistakenly assumed Pahoran was part of the problem and threatened to remove him as head of the government.

I have puzzled many years why Mormon would include a detailed account of this uncharacteristic error by the great Captain Moroni. I expect it was for at least two reasons.

One would be to show us that none of us, not even the great Captain Moroni, is immune from presumption and rash judgment. What a comfort it is to me, and I hope to you, that we are in the best of company when we make errors of this kind. This is not to excuse them but to give us permission to admit our mistakes and to learn from them.

The second reason is to show us one of the best examples in all of scripture of how to respond to an unjust accusation. We know very little about Pahoran except that he was an upright ruler committed to standing "fast in that liberty in . . . which God . . . made us free."&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; In chapter 61, Mormon, as editor, gave us Pahorans entire response to Captain Moroni. I will quote only two of the 20 verses included in his answer:

&lt;i&gt;I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words. . . . Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but &lt;/i&gt;do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

How did Pahoran do it? How could he respond in such humility and meekness before the Lord? He probably sat right down and wrote an angry reply, venting his injured feelings against Moroni. If so, when he was finished, he did what we all must do - he tore it up and threw it away. Then he must have spent long hours in supplication to the Lord to find the strength to overlook the unjust accusations and to reply with such compassion and love.

In Proverbs we read that "grievous words stir up anger" and "a soft answer turneth away wrath."&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Pahorans soft answer is a beautiful example of what the Prophet Joseph said about "the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of &lt;i&gt;His&lt;/i&gt; ways."&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

Even in this misjudgment Moroni is also our model. When he learned of his error, he was not prideful. He immediately marched to the aid of Pahoran, and with their combined forces they overthrew the king-men and the Lamanites, and peace was restored in the land.

As you reflect on these examples, do they call to mind any other gospel principles? Im thinking in particular of that favorite scripture, Ether 12:27:

&lt;i&gt;And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.&lt;/i&gt;

President Kimball taught this gospel principle in terms of mirrors. He said, "Our vision is completely obscured when we have no mirror to [show us] our own faults and [we] look only for the foibles of others."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

Edward Edinger, a wise psychologist, wrote this about mirrors:

[A mirror] &lt;i&gt;shows us what we otherwise cannot see for ourselves because we are too close to it. Without a mirror, for instance, we would never even know what our face looks like; since we are inside looking out, there can be no self-knowledge, even the elementary self-knowledge of what we look like, unless there is some device that can turn the light back on us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Observations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I conclude with a few final observations about conflicts. Again, more could be said, but you will understand.

1. Conflicts are easy to get into but difficult to get out of. If we have the courage to face them early, they are easier to resolve and to learn from.

2. Conflicts can be dangerous, because they easily fly out of control. They need good containers - such as good friendships and solid marriages - to hold them in. Early detection helps.

3. There are plenty of conflicts. They are also cyclical. If we dont learn from one, thats okay; wait a while, and, sure enough, the conflict will come around again and again until it either destroys a relationship or we learn from it. (If we learn from it, we move on to the next level of conflict, higher up on the plane of progression.)

4. Things often get worse before they get better. But it is generally better to face the problem now than to wait for the next time around.

5. Its cruel that it should be this way, but the thing were supposed to learn about ourselves is usually obvious to the person were in conflict with.

6. Even when we are right, we may be wrong. Even when we are right - or &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when we are right - if we are presumptuous and rash, we will give offense and become a stumbling block to others.

7. We learn by experience; but experience is not a very good teacher &lt;i&gt;unless &lt;/i&gt;we remember our conflicts. It is a mark of greatness to remember and to learn from our conflicts.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We should think of our conflicts as mirrors that reflect back upon us things about ourselves we would rather not know. As we learn in Ether 12:27, it is a gift from heaven to be shown our weakness. If we will reflect upon &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; weakness, as the Prophet Joseph did upon his, the Lord will make us strong where we are weak.

I pray we may learn from our conflicts, that the Lord may teach us of &lt;i&gt;His&lt;/i&gt; ways. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Some months ago, when I was invited to speak today, I asked what I should talk about. After a long pause the voice said, "Well, people usually talk about things theyre good at." So my topic today is conflict.</p>
<p>I used to think other people had conflicts but that I was immune. Then I came upon two incidents in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith that completely changed my understanding of conflicts and forced me to admit I probably have as many as anybody else.</p>
<p>What is a conflict? For our purposes today, a conflict is any situation in which both sides feel the other is in the wrong.</p>
<p>Ill begin with seven propositions about conflicts.</p>
<p>1. It is strange, but unless we had a conflict in the last few hours, most of us dont remember our conflicts. This may be good, because it saves us pain, but it creates a problem. If we dont remember our conflicts, we cant learn anything from them.</p>
<p>2. We probably experience conflicts differently - depending on our personalities, our prior experiences (such as the way conflicts were handled in the home where we grew up), and perhaps other factors such as gender and culture.</p>
<p>3. In Mormon culture most people are conflict avoiders. However, some of us are neutral about conflict, and some of us actually enjoy a good conflict.</p>
<p>4. If we are in relationships with others, there will be conflicts. They may be small or they may be large, but there will surely be conflicts. Can you think of any conflicts in your life right now? Perhaps a few hints will help. If you do think of a conflict or two, I hope you will jot them down.</p>
<p>a. Conflicts with family, such as father, mother, siblings, spouse, children, or in-laws.</p>
<p>b. Conflicts with people you see often who are <i>not</i> family: neighbors, landlords, merchants, even people at church. President Brigham Young summed it up in rhyme:</p>
<p><i>To live with Saints in Heaven is bliss and glory</i></p>
<p><i>To live with Saints on Earth is another story.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>5. It takes two sides to create a conflict. More important, there is almost always fault on <i>both</i> sides. As someone said, "Its a mighty thin pancake that only has one side."</p>
<p>6. During a conflict we are usually blind to our own fault and we blame the other side.</p>
<p>7. A final proposition introduces my theme. When we remember our conflicts and reflect on them, they are like mirrors that can teach us things about ourselves that are otherwise difficult to discover. If we permit them, our conflicts will show us where we are weak, defensive, prideful, or otherwise in need of repair.</p>
<h2><b>First Example</b></h2>
<p>Ill illustrate the value of conflicts with three examples. Two are from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These both involve Oliver Cowdery, who, at the time, was Josephs most trusted associate. These conflicts occurred very close to each other in the summer of 1830, just after the Church was organized. Joseph was 24 years old, and Oliver was 23.</p>
<p>Joseph was busy copying and arranging revelations for publication. Oliver was staying with the Whitmer family in Fayette, 80 miles to the north. Out of the blue, Joseph received a letter from Oliver.</p>
<p>Joseph recorded:</p>
<p>[Oliver] <i>wrote to inform me that he had discovered an error in one of the commandments - Book of Doctrine and Covenants: "And truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins"</i> [D&amp;C 20:37].</p>
<p><i>The above quotation,</i> [Oliver] <i>said, was erroneous, and added: "I command you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"</i></p>
<p>The Prophet continued:</p>
<p><i>I immediately wrote to him in reply, in which I asked him by what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God.</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Doctrinally, Oliver was wrong and Joseph was right. But knowing that doesnt solve the problem. These two trusted friends were now in a conflict - both felt the other was in the wrong. The doctrinal issue could be solved, but what about the bad feelings that had arisen between them?</p>
<p>Realizing his letter had not really answered the doctrinal question and had made the interpersonal problem worse, Joseph traveled 80 miles to the Whitmer home to meet with Oliver and the Whitmers.</p>
<p>Joseph reported:</p>
<p><i>I found the</i> [Whitmer] <i>family in general of</i> [Olivers] <i>opinion concerning the words above quoted, and it was not without both labor and perseverance that I could prevail with any of them to reason calmly on the subject. . . . Finally, with</i> [Christian Whitmers] <i>assistance, I succeeded in bringing, not only the Whitmer family, but also Oliver Cowdery to acknowledge that they had been in error, and that the sentence in dispute was in accordance with the rest of the commandment.</i></p>
<p>Joseph then reflected on what he learned from this experience. His conclusions are the centerpiece of my message today:</p>
<p><i>And thus was this error rooted out, which having its rise in presumption and rash judgment, was . . . particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Judging from his emphasis on humility and meekness, Joseph was commenting not only on Olivers doctrinal error but also on the interpersonal conflict between them and, I think, on the nature of conflicts in general. With prophetic insight he taught two important lessons. His first point was that conflicts arise "in presumption and rash judgment." <i>Presumptuous</i> means overconfident or even offensive. <i>Rash</i> means hasty or impetuous. With these definitions in mind, let us look again at Olivers message to Joseph. He said: "I command you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Do you see any ways in which Olivers statement might be considered rash or presumptuous? Certainly commanding another person risks being offensive, especially if it is your ecclesiastical leader. Commanding "in the name of God" would raise offensiveness a degree or two. Accusing your leader of priestcraft would undoubtedly qualify.</p>
<p>I move to the next statement with trepidation, but Joseph invited us to consider the effect of his reply as well. Joseph "immediately wrote to [Oliver]," asking: "By what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God."</p>
<p>Are there ways in which Josephs words might have lacked "humility and meekness"? At a minimum he might have responded with a comment and a question such as, "Oliver, I love you and I value your opinion. Would you help me understand your objection to this passage?"</p>
<p>Josephs second point added power to the first. He concluded that "[conflicts are] particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us."</p>
<p>Three ideas stand out in this statement. First, conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something. Second, we cant learn from them until they are fairly understood, until we can see both sides - meaning we need to cool off before we can learn from them. Third, in a marvelous illustration of his own humility, Joseph included himself as one who learned something important from this conflict.</p>
<p>If our conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something, what are we supposed to learn? Josephs answer goes deep: Conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us "the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways."</p>
<p>Why did Joseph say humility "before the Lord"? Why didnt he say "before the person on the other side"? To learn from our conflicts we must be willing to see our own faults, and we need the Lords help to do that. Only then can He begin to "teach us of <i>His</i> ways" (emphasis added).</p>
<p>We come to the ultimate question: What <i>are</i> the Lords ways for dealing with conflict? They are illustrated in a second conflict between Joseph and Oliver.</p>
<h2><b>Second Example</b></h2>
<p>Just a month after the first conflict, to escape persecution, Joseph and Emma moved 80 miles north to the Whitmer home in Fayette - the home Joseph had so recently visited to resolve the first conflict. Arriving at the Whitmer home, Joseph was grieved to learn that Hiram Page, one of the eight witnesses to the Book of Mormon, had been receiving revelations through a "seer stone" that purported to give instructions on how the Church should operate. Newel Knight was with Joseph, and he described the seriousness of the problem:</p>
<p>[Hiram Page] <i>had managed to get up some dissension of feeling among the brethren by giving revelations concerning the government of the Church . . . , which he claimed to have received through the medium of a stone he possessed. . . . Even Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmer family had given heed to them.</i><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>What could have been more painful and frustrating to Joseph than this? If Joseph had followed his earlier pattern, he would have demanded of Hiram Page by what authority he presumed to receive revelations for the Church, and he would have demanded of Oliver what on earth he was thinking to believe in such things. But Joseph was more aware that a hasty and intemperate response would not solve the problem. Joseph knew what <i>not</i> to do, but he wasnt sure what he <i>ought</i> to do.</p>
<p>Newel Knight wrote:</p>
<p><i>Joseph was perplexed and scarcely knew how to meet this new exigency. That night I occupied the same room that he did and the greater part of the night was spent in prayer and supplication.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Rather than react defensively, Joseph patiently sought counsel from the Lord. He was soon granted an answer in the form of a revelation, which is now section 28 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<h2><b>Doctrine and Covenants, Section 28</b></h2>
<p>Section 28 is well known for answering the question of who <i>can - </i>and who <i>cannot - </i>receive revelation for the Church. It is also a model of the Lords willingness to see wrongdoers in the larger context of their lives and to show divine confidence in them while reproving or correcting them.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke in the first person directly to Oliver: "Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them . . ." The Lords first words were an affirmation of Olivers good standing in the Lords eyes. Then He added this stipulation: ". . . by the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>After clarifying that only the prophet can receive revelation for the Church, the Lord reaffirmed His divine confidence in Oliver: "And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to <i>speak</i> . . . by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it."<sup>8</sup> And then, again, He outlined the limits on Olivers authority: "But thou shalt not <i>write</i> by way of commandment, but by wisdom; And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>The Lord then turned to the source of the problem: Hiram Page. I am struck that He spoke with the same concern for Hirams feelings as He had shown for Olivers. This exemplifies the Lords way, and it makes it much easier for Hiram to accept correction: "Take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Instructed and corrected in this loving and reaffirming way, both Oliver Cowdery and Hiram Page recognized their error and continued in full fellowship in the Church for a long while.</p>
<h2><b>Third Example</b></h2>
<p>These two events in the life of the Prophet Joseph prepare us for one other scriptural example - the painful misunderstanding between Moroni and Pahoran in Alma 59 through 62. I wonder if this is where the Prophet Joseph gained his own understanding that conflicts are meaningful and we must learn from them.</p>
<p>Moroni is one of the great military leaders in all of scripture. At the early age of 25 he was made captain over all the Nephite armies. As you will recall, when the prophet Mormon abridged the records of Moronis military leadership, he called him "a man of a perfect understanding"<sup>11</sup> and honored him with this remarkable endorsement:</p>
<p><i>If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</i></p>
<p><i>Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon . . . , and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>It has always astonished me that this same Mormon included, as part of his abridged record, a vivid account of Moronis conflict with Pahoran, the chief judge and governor of the Nephites.</p>
<p>As we learn in Alma 59, Moronis army was caught in a dangerous situation. Lamanite armies were rapidly gaining ground against them. As chief military leader, Moroni wrote Pahoran for reinforcements. Receiving none, the scripture reports, "Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>When no help came from the government, Moroni wrote Pahoran again. He began with the facts: the suffering of his men, the slaughter of thousands of the Nephite people, and other atrocities of war. But Moroni didnt realize that Pahoran had been driven from his throne by the king-men and forced to take refuge in Gideon, and Moroni wrongly accused Pahoran of being a traitor to his own country. Moroni concluded with these challenging words: "Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>We are treading sacred ground here. Is there any question whether the Lord had inspired Moroni to know there were problems at the government level that called for military help? Not at all. However, in his abridgment, Mormon made it clear that Moroni mistakenly assumed Pahoran was part of the problem and threatened to remove him as head of the government.</p>
<p>I have puzzled many years why Mormon would include a detailed account of this uncharacteristic error by the great Captain Moroni. I expect it was for at least two reasons.</p>
<p>One would be to show us that none of us, not even the great Captain Moroni, is immune from presumption and rash judgment. What a comfort it is to me, and I hope to you, that we are in the best of company when we make errors of this kind. This is not to excuse them but to give us permission to admit our mistakes and to learn from them.</p>
<p>The second reason is to show us one of the best examples in all of scripture of how to respond to an unjust accusation. We know very little about Pahoran except that he was an upright ruler committed to standing "fast in that liberty in . . . which God . . . made us free."<sup>15</sup> In chapter 61, Mormon, as editor, gave us Pahorans entire response to Captain Moroni. I will quote only two of the 20 verses included in his answer:</p>
<p><i>I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words. . . . Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but </i>do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>How did Pahoran do it? How could he respond in such humility and meekness before the Lord? He probably sat right down and wrote an angry reply, venting his injured feelings against Moroni. If so, when he was finished, he did what we all must do - he tore it up and threw it away. Then he must have spent long hours in supplication to the Lord to find the strength to overlook the unjust accusations and to reply with such compassion and love.</p>
<p>In Proverbs we read that "grievous words stir up anger" and "a soft answer turneth away wrath."<sup>17</sup> Pahorans soft answer is a beautiful example of what the Prophet Joseph said about "the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of <i>His</i> ways."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Even in this misjudgment Moroni is also our model. When he learned of his error, he was not prideful. He immediately marched to the aid of Pahoran, and with their combined forces they overthrew the king-men and the Lamanites, and peace was restored in the land.</p>
<p>As you reflect on these examples, do they call to mind any other gospel principles? Im thinking in particular of that favorite scripture, Ether 12:27:</p>
<p><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i></p>
<p>President Kimball taught this gospel principle in terms of mirrors. He said, "Our vision is completely obscured when we have no mirror to [show us] our own faults and [we] look only for the foibles of others."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Edward Edinger, a wise psychologist, wrote this about mirrors:</p>
<p>[A mirror] <i>shows us what we otherwise cannot see for ourselves because we are too close to it. Without a mirror, for instance, we would never even know what our face looks like; since we are inside looking out, there can be no self-knowledge, even the elementary self-knowledge of what we look like, unless there is some device that can turn the light back on us.</i><sup>20</sup></p>
<h2><b>Final Observations</b></h2>
<p>I conclude with a few final observations about conflicts. Again, more could be said, but you will understand.</p>
<p>1. Conflicts are easy to get into but difficult to get out of. If we have the courage to face them early, they are easier to resolve and to learn from.</p>
<p>2. Conflicts can be dangerous, because they easily fly out of control. They need good containers - such as good friendships and solid marriages - to hold them in. Early detection helps.</p>
<p>3. There are plenty of conflicts. They are also cyclical. If we dont learn from one, thats okay; wait a while, and, sure enough, the conflict will come around again and again until it either destroys a relationship or we learn from it. (If we learn from it, we move on to the next level of conflict, higher up on the plane of progression.)</p>
<p>4. Things often get worse before they get better. But it is generally better to face the problem now than to wait for the next time around.</p>
<p>5. Its cruel that it should be this way, but the thing were supposed to learn about ourselves is usually obvious to the person were in conflict with.</p>
<p>6. Even when we are right, we may be wrong. Even when we are right - or <i>especially</i> when we are right - if we are presumptuous and rash, we will give offense and become a stumbling block to others.</p>
<p>7. We learn by experience; but experience is not a very good teacher <i>unless </i>we remember our conflicts. It is a mark of greatness to remember and to learn from our conflicts.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>We should think of our conflicts as mirrors that reflect back upon us things about ourselves we would rather not know. As we learn in Ether 12:27, it is a gift from heaven to be shown our weakness. If we will reflect upon <i>our</i> weakness, as the Prophet Joseph did upon his, the Lord will make us strong where we are weak.</p>
<p>I pray we may learn from our conflicts, that the Lord may teach us of <i>His</i> ways. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When we moved to Provo thirty years ago, I was in my twenties. Our oldest son was two, and our youngest son was just a few weeks old. I had been a member of the Church for less than ten years.
Shortly after arriving in Provo, I met Bertha. Bertha was in her sixties. I knew a little bit about Bertha. I knew she lived in our stake. I knew she was respected by those who knew her. I also knew that she was a leader and a woman of service. People sought her advice.
I remember attending a stake Relief Society function at which Bertha was one of the women on a panel that was answering questions and giving advice to those in attendance on a variety of topics. I noticed that Bertha was being asked for a lot of advice about raising children. I soon discovered why. She was the mother of thirteen children. I appreciated her responses to the questions. She seemed to have all the wisdom and experience that I lacked.
Another thing I knew about Bertha was that she seemed to like walking. Sometimes I would see her walking in the neighborhood. One morning while I was walking with my friend, she asked me if it would be okay if Bertha joined us occasionally on our walks. I told her that was fine. But privately, the thought of walking with Bertha intimidated me somewhat, mainly because I held her in such high esteem.
A few days later my friend invited Bertha to walk with us. Before Bertha met us for our walk that morning, my friend told me a couple of things about Bertha that she thought would be helpful to me. She told me that Bertha sometimes had a little difficulty hearing and that her shins sometimes bothered her - especially when walking uphill. I thought these things were good to know.
Our walking route that day began in the Tree Streets south of the Provo Temple. We headed toward the temple, which is a steady uphill walk. I dont remember much of our conversation that day. I remember only the question I asked Bertha once we reached the top of the road by the temple and began our steady descent toward home.
Remembering that Berthas shins sometimes bothered her, I asked, "Bertha, how are your shins?"
There was a bit of an awkward pause, and then, with much earnestness, Bertha replied, "Im working on them, and hopefully they are improving every day."
I responded, "Oh, thats good. Thankfully its all downhill from here."
I was feeling pretty magnanimous about my expressed concern for Bertha. For a couple of minutes we walked along in a somewhat awkward silence.
Then my friend suddenly got a relieved look on her face and, turning to me, exclaimed, "You said shins, didnt you?"
My first thought was, "Yes, of course I said shins." Then it occurred to me that they had both thought I had asked Bertha how her sins were doing!
I was mortified! There I was, this inexperienced young mother, asking Bertha, this accomplished and</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My father was a builder of big buildings, some well known. So when I returned from my two-year mission to Japan and wanted summer work, I ended up forty feet down at the bottom of an air conditioning shaft, stripping forms from freshly poured concrete. My captive coworker, Chuck, made the mistake of asking why I would "waste two valuable years like that." I am sure he had no idea what he was in for, and I unleashed my abundance of missionary zeal.
At some point in our discussion I heard a noise overhead and saw the familiar silhouette of my father leaning over the shaft. What he said was a surprise: "Chuck, I dont know what hes saying down there, but I believe it is true. Now get back to work."
This is for me the most treasured testimony my father bore, but I hope we can surpass that level of communication today. I dont want you to go back to class thinking, "I dont know what he was saying down there, but I believe it is true." Instead I want to persuade you to rethink the way you communicate to others your feelings about your connections to heaven and the amazing blessings of what you know and what you feel.
Why persuade? Because "no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood" - and I hold no position that grants me that kind of dominion over you anyway - "only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;C 121:41). I want to persuade you to consider another perspective that will help you follow the counsel of an apostle.
Elder David A. Bednar stood here in August and asked us "to sweep the earth as with a flood of truth and righteousness" in our online efforts ("To Sweep the Earth as with a Flood," BYU Education Week devotional address, 19 August 2014, lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/to-sweep-the-earth-as-with-a-flood). His devotional was historic in many ways. I was so delighted.
Elder Bednars first qualification for this effort was simple:
We are disciples, and our messages should be authentic. A person or product that is not authentic is false, fake, and fraudulent. Our messages should be truthful, honest, and accurate. We should not exaggerate, embellish, or pretend to be someone or something we are not. ["To Sweep the Earth"]
Following his counsel to be authentic will be more difficult for us, as central-culture Mormons, because for decades we have desired to honor the Lord by always putting our best foot forward. Look down at your feet, if you will. The problem is that nearly every mortal has two feet, and most require both of those feet to stand properly.
Over the past ten years I have regularly had the punishment and privilege of watching through a one-way mirror as focus groups discuss Mormons. The people in these groups were not just any people; they were selected for these sessions because their beliefs and actions demo</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, Dr. Broomhead and members of the University Chorale, for that wonderful rendition of "For All the Saints" (Hymns, 1985, no. 82). That song is to be sung majestically, which you certainly did. Your words set the tone for my address today. I would like to look at how we as Saints - "faithful, true, and bold" - might increase our efforts to profess our faith.
On a rather cold, rainy day many years ago, I found myself in a meeting over a difficult issue. Waiting outside this meeting was what appeared to be an army of reporters. To say that I was a bit unnerved by their presence is an understatement. I was new to the office of University Communications, having spent 12 years with BYU Magazine, and was still trying to adjust to the media scrutiny that accompanies a breaking story.
As the meeting concluded, someone asked the question "Who is going to talk to all of those reporters?"
The person in charge responded, "Carri is."
And with that, everyone got up and left.
Do you remember how Moses felt when the Lord asked him to represent the Israelites before Pharaoh? In my own small way, I think I caught a glimpse of it on that rainy day. I too wanted to cry out, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent . . . : but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" (Exodus 4:10).
But, just as the Lord beckoned Moses to "therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth" (Exodus 4:12), I felt the Lords gentle push in response to my hasty prayer. And so I walked out that door confident in the message I needed to deliver, even if I was not confident as the messenger.
I faced the reporters, and all went well until the final question, when they asked if they could interview BYU students about the Honor Code. I knew I could not say no, even though I really wanted to just handpick a few students who I knew would respond in a predictable and positive way.
Instead I responded, "Absolutely. Talk to anyone you like."
That night as I waited for the 10 oclock news to air, my heart was racing. I knew what I had said, but what I didnt know was how the students had responded. I wondered if they would challenge and negate everything I had said.
As I watched the various news reports and those random students - students just like you - talk about their feelings and belief in the Honor Code, my once-racing heart swelled with pride. I realized that while in this instance I had been asked to be the official spokesperson for BYU, the most important spokespeople were you, the students. It was your voices people would remember; it was your voices that turned a rather negative news story into a positive one.
Today I would like to talk about what it means to be a spokesperson - at BYU and in the kingdom of God - a role that each one of us plays. The incident that I described above is not unique; in fact, it happens on an almost daily basis. Perhaps you saw this recent</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am happy to be here today, though I feel like the speaker in church who said she felt inadequate standing before the congregation. One sister said to another, "Isnt she humble?" And the other responded, "Thats no real accomplishment, she has a lot to be humble about."
Some of my students are sitting here thinking, "No joke!"
I do feel overwhelmed at the prospect of attempting to share something new and of value as I stand in the footsteps of the great men and women who have been here before me. I pray I can share some of my life and thoughts in a way that may help some of you have a new and useful perspective about words and their place in a Christ-centered life.
Words are my tools. As a librarian I collect, catalog, and preserve them. As a lawyer, which is my principal profession, I search them out, savoring the power, sound, feel, and nuance of them. As a mother, words are something I teach, and teach with - a method of motivation, reward, and reprimand. As a person of faith, they are second only to spiritual promptings as a form of guidance, comfort, and inspiration.
Lately, however, I have observed a distressing escalation of the use of words to hurt, anger, divide, and make war. Perhaps as a law professor I should approve of the trend. It does, after all, make well-paying work for many of our graduates. However, I have viewed myself as a solver of problems and a peacemaker, not as a warrior. I have not found entertainment in L.A. Law or its more recent progeny. Neither am I comfortable with the wars of words that rage around us.
Today I would like to talk about the power of words. I would like to remind you of some of their magic. There is nothing arcane about words. They are not supernatural. They are like light and gravity - they are central to our existence, and, because they are pervasive, we often fail to see them or recognize their power and worth.
John sets us on the right path:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. [John 1:13]
The Savior is the Word. Let us consider whether our words are worthy of Him.
Words are among the most marvelous gifts we have as human beings. Words are tools used by God to build the necessary framework to lift us from our mortal existence and carry us back to His presence. He uses words for making and keeping binding commitments. The difference between an eternal marriage and a marriage of degrading cohabitation is a few words.
