  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I testify that God, our Heavenly Father, loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son, Jesus Christ. Like Alma, "I testify unto you that I do know that these things . . . are true. . . . They are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God" (Alma 5:4546). I know these things because of my own journey. And if Heavenly Father loves me and knows of me - since He is no respecter of persons - He loves you as well.

My purpose today is to share with you five facets of my testimony that show God loves us. These are simple and quite personal. I pray that your testimony of Gods love for you will grow as you think of your own experiences and that together we may receive the "word of truth" through the Holy Ghost (D&amp;amp;C 50:17). I hope that as I speak, you will contemplate the many ways that God loves you. As I conclude today, I will ask you a question: "So what are you going to do?"

&lt;b&gt;First:&lt;/b&gt; I testify that God loves us because He grants unto us the revelator known as the Holy Ghost.

It was October of 1972, a clear and sunny Sunday. I was a freshman at BYU. I rode my bicycle up Provo Canyon to Upper Falls. There I contemplated what in the world I was doing here. You see, I came to BYU as a nonmember. Why? Well, several friends at high school were going to BYU, and they simply invited me along. I applied to BYU, and when my parents and I visited campus, coming from smoggy and dry Southern California, we were sold. I knew very little about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints except that they didnt smoke or drink.

I had arrived on campus a week or so early to attend a late summer honors program. There I met my first roommate, Rahn Price. After a long day we were ready to go to sleep in our room in Deseret Towers (may they rest in peace). Then something unusual happened. Rahn rolled out of bed, knelt at his bedside, and prayed silently. I didnt know what to do. I was quite astonished. I finally said my own prayer:

&lt;i&gt;Now I lay me down to sleep,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I pray the Lord my soul to keep;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Should I die before I wake,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I pray the Lord my soul to take.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Amen.&lt;/i&gt;

I was done well before he was. Much later, Rahn said that was the most awkward prayer he had ever said. However, Im grateful that he did say that prayer.

As the semester began, I learned about agency from a Book of Mormon teacher named Bruce Hafen. I learned of the Atonement. Although I had grown up in a Christian church and was raised by "goodly parents" (1 Nephi 1:1), these concepts were certainly deeper than the wading pool of doctrine I had grown up with.

Once the semester began, my friends in Helaman Halls invited me to church, but I respectfully declined. They did not pester me or make me feel out of place. On Sundays I would just do my own activities, limited as they were by a bicycle.

I found that agency - a topic I had been learning about in my Book of Mormon class - was interesting as presented in the dorms. It was fast Sunday (whatever that meant), and when my floor went off to church, I went down to the Cannon Center for a casual breakfast. But there was no breakfast because it was fast Sunday. I hadnt planned to fast, but it appeared that I would be fasting even though I hadnt planned on it. This was in the day when you didnt have refrigerators and microwave ovens in each dorm room. There was no food there. I was suddenly faced with my own mortality - I knew I was going to die. I figured I had just enough strength left to make it to some local restaurant. Der Wienerschnitzel was the closest. All I needed was a little food to tide me over until the obligatory fast Sunday concluded in the dorms. So I ordered about a dozen hot dogs. Ive been grateful to Der Weinerschnitzel ever since.

But thankfully I matured. With the help of Rahn, my other friends, Brother Hafen, and my own budding awareness of the beautiful doctrines of the gospel, a seed had been planted. And on that October Sunday morning at Upper Falls, I actually asked Heavenly Father a question - something I was not taught to do growing up. Like most, I was taught that you can ask for blessings. It had never really occurred to me to ask Heavenly Father a question, because that implied you expected an answer - that you expected God to actually hear your prayer and acknowledge it with some sort of communication. It wasnt even a question about the Church I had at that time. I wasnt ready for that just yet. It was a question about me: "What wouldst thou have me do?" For the first time in my life I felt what I knew in an instant was the Holy Ghost, that unmistakably distinct and identifiable feeling in my bosom that has since guided me in all matters spiritual and most temporal: a warmth - not alarming or acidic, but peaceful and calm - that gave me clarity and resolve. Like the answer cited by Sister Matsumori in Octobers general conference: "It felt like sunshine" (Vicki F. Matsumori, "Helping Others Recognize the Whisperings of the Spirit," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2009, 10).

What was my answer? That I had a special mission to perform. I had no idea what that meant. It didnt matter at that time, because what I had found out that day was that God lives, that He knew who I was, and that, whatever He was doing at the time, He had answered my prayer through the Holy Ghost. Ive been grateful ever since and have tried to demonstrate that gratitude by serving Him. My view of the world had changed: from peering through a keyhole at life to having an eternal panorama opened to my heart and minds view.

If God loved me enough to answer my prayer, I know that He loves each of you.

&lt;b&gt;Second:&lt;/b&gt; I testify that God loves you because He restored the priesthood, and the Aaronic Priesthood in particular, to the earth. I testify that His love is manifest through the gift of the ministering of angels that can protect us and comfort us as we learn more about Him.

Since that day in October my heart was prepared to receive the gospel. I learned by study and also by faith. I noted that Rahn held the Aaronic Priesthood and was a priest in that priesthood. Through sacred experiences we had together, I know that the Aaronic Priesthood encompasses the power of God and the keys of the ministering of angels. I know that such keys are a gift to young men in the Church who love Him. It is something to be desired. At the time, I identified with Simon, the sorcerer of the New Testament, who said, "Give me also this power" (Acts 8:19). Although Simon spoke of the Melchizedek Priesthood, I was desiring this Aaronic Priesthood. I know that the priesthood - Melchizedek and Aaronic - is Gods love made manifest to us to protect and serve. When you return home soon and see those gangly young Aaronic Priesthood holders in your ward, you might remember to thank them for carrying the power of God within them.

&lt;b&gt;Third:&lt;/b&gt; I testify that Heavenly Father loves us because He blesses us so much as we try to serve Him. He meets us much more than halfway when we act on the smallest seed of faith. He blesses us all along our journey back to His presence when we incline our ear and heart toward Him.

December 2, 1972, was a clear and crisp day. It was the day of my baptism. All the guys on my floor in Helaman Halls were up early getting ready for the service. But of course nobody said a word to me. Its a guy thing - like baseball players who dont want to jinx a pitcher who goes into the seventh inning with a no-hitter. I was both amused and impressed.

Who but Rahn Price baptized me? I received the gift of the Holy Ghost, which spirit had led me to the place I was at that time (see D&amp;amp;C 6:14). I received the priesthood and felt the whole armor of God. Thank you, Rahn. A few months later I was ordained a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood by Norm Nemrow. (You might know him as Professor Nemrow here at BYU.) Thank you, Norm.

I was soon called as a home teacher. I was excited to serve with this Aaronic Priesthood that I had so much desired. One evening I had a particularly vexing physics homework assignment to do. I also had home teaching appointments. For the first time I faced a test of my new faith. What to do? Up until that time intellect had been the king of my hill, my lofty aspiration. But now? How did faith work once you were baptized? Would Heavenly Father turn His attention elsewhere now that I was within the Church? I went home teaching. When I returned to my dorm room to tackle Physics 121, all I can say is that Heavenly Father magnified my efforts in a very personal and significant way. I had not known that the Holy Ghost could teach physics. Ive never forgotten that lesson of being blessed beyond what I merited at the time. I was strengthened, confirmed in my faith, and encouraged.

King Benjamin put it this way:

&lt;i&gt;I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another - I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 2:2124]

Heavenly Father blesses us so that our seeds of faith can grow all of our lives to produce a harvest of happiness as we put the kingdom of God first and allow everything else to follow (see Matthew 6:33). The Lord said, "I will go before you and be your rearward; and I will be in your midst, and you shall not be confounded" (D&amp;amp;C 49:27). I agree with Nephi, who said, "My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep" (2 Nephi 4:20). Each effort I make, no matter how small, is blessed greatly. God is truly generous with His love.

My faith was tried more seriously as I considered what to do about a full-time mission as a convert to the Church. I testify that as I exerted my faith, Heavenly Father strengthened my heart and melted the hearts of my parents, who had been adamantly opposed to my serving. But Heavenly Father went before my face and softened their hearts. I was able to serve with their blessing, and in giving back some of the love I had been given, as I served, I received, as usual, more blessings than I deserved.

I know that God will support you as you look to Him in every good thing. Hes got your back! Selfless service at any time increases our gratitude for God.

&lt;b&gt;Fourth:&lt;/b&gt; I testify that God loves us because He wants us to have everything that He has; He puts no limits on how much we can learn, grow, and progress. Our friend Stephen Covey calls it an "abundance mentality" versus a "scarcity mentality." Heavenly Father calls it the "plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8), the plan that can "bring to pass [our] immortality and eternal life" (Moses 1:39).

I remember when I walked upstairs in the original Harold B. Lee Library that in the stairwell I was confronted with the scripture "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). I was initially shocked at such a thing, but after my October experience and others like it, I came to know that there is no limit to how much we can learn, love, and live. William W. Phelps put it this way in verses 4 and 5 of his hymn:

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to virtue;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to might;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to wisdom;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to light.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to union;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to youth;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to priesthood;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to truth.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to glory;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to love;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to being;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no death above.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to glory;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to love;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no end to being;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no death above.&lt;/i&gt;

["If You Could Hie to Kolob," &lt;i&gt;Hymns, &lt;/i&gt;1985, no. 284]

President Uchtdorf recently summarized:

&lt;i&gt;Our Father in Heaven has given us, His children, much more than any mortal mind can comprehend. Under His direction the Great Jehovah created this wondrous world we live in. God the Father watches over us, fills our hearts with breathtaking joy, brightens our darkest hours with blessed peace, distills upon our minds precious truths, shepherds us through times of distress, rejoices when we rejoice, and answers our righteous petitions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He offers to His children the promise of a glorious and infinite existence and has provided a way for us to progress in knowledge and glory until we receive a fulness of joy. He has promised us all that He has.&lt;/i&gt; [Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Love of God," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2009, 22]

Were really tested with this concept as parents. Our oldest daughter has borne the brunt of much of our learning. (Come to think about it, though, our other three children didnt fare much better.) But as an active teenager, she would ask if she could go do this or that with her friends. Her requests were always reasonable, and she reminds us often that we were lucky that she even asked. But I remember once telling her no. She, of course, wanted to know why. I said, "Because Im your father, and I figure every once in awhile I should exercise that right and just say no." Well, how silly that was! Heavenly Father doesnt do that because He doesnt exercise such capricious constraints. She and I talked for quite awhile that night because she justifiably called me on my section 121 violation (see verses 3946). So I let her go and demonstrated my love and trust for her.

In addition to Heavenly Father not constraining us capriciously, I know that He loves us because He is anxious to impart all knowledge into our hands:

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 88:79]

The knowledge that comes by the Holy Ghost through faith and prayer could be very useful to you in the upcoming days.

Fifth: I testify that God loves us because He sent His Son to atone for our sins and for the sins of all humankind everywhere. This is the most powerful manifestation of all. I felt it first as I prepared for baptism and now each week as I prepare to receive the sacrament.

The Atonement has been written about for centuries by prophets both ancient and modern, but is it written in our hearts? The Atonement is not an academic abstract that is learned like the multiplication tables. If we are prepared, like Nephi and Enos, the Atonement can sink deep in our hearts and fill us with wonder (see 1 Nephi 1114; Enos 1:3).

The manner of receiving the teaching of the Atonement is illustrated with the examples of Nephi and his elder-in-age but younger-in-spirit brothers, Laman and Lemuel.

Nephi, in seeking an interpretation of his father Lehis dream, had a discourse with an angel:

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he said unto me: What desirest thou?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

Its interesting that the angel didnt just tell Nephi the interpretation. As a matter of fact, the angel could have made a nice spreadsheet of the vision, with the symbols across the top in columns and the explanation in the next row. But instead:

&lt;i&gt;It came to pass that he said unto me: Look! . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?&lt;/i&gt;

Well? Had the angel made a spreadsheet? No! Nephi experienced the answer:

&lt;i&gt;And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 11:923]

The love of God is the most desirable and joyous to the soul. Later Nephi testified:

&lt;i&gt;And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world. &lt;/i&gt;[1 Nephi 11:33]

The Atonement had sunk deep into Nephis heart.

Contrast this with Laman and Lemuels experience. They had dismissed the visit of an angel (see 1 Nephi 3:31), did not believe the words of their father (see 1 Nephi 2:1112), and found "the truth to be hard" (1 Nephi 16:2). When they asked Nephi about the interpretation of each element of the dream, Nephi simply gave them the spreadsheet explanation. Although the Atonement had taken root in the fleshy portion of Nephis heart (see 2 Corinthians 3:3), the hardened hearts of Laman and Lemuel remained unchanged (see 1 Nephi 16:22).

The Atonement is a gift from Heavenly Father through His Son that we especially need to remember at this time of year. It was the ultimate gift of both the Father and the Son: of the Father because He allowed His Son to suffer; of the Son because of what He did for us. Even football fans know the most famous scripture of all:

&lt;i&gt;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&lt;/i&gt; [John 3:16]

A glimpse of our Heavenly Fathers anguish came to me several years ago during a high-adventure trip with my oldest son and several members of his priests quorum. We had gone to the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. One of the activities the boys wanted to do was ride their bicycles on the paved road down from the top of Mount Constitution. Ive done a bit of riding in my life, and I encouraged the boys to first ride up the mountain so they could remember where the gravel, the cracks in the pavement, the tightest turns, and other such potential hazards were. But of course that was too hard. So we took all the boys and the bikes to the top and all started down. I came down last, and I helped pick up each boy as each crashed at a different location. My son, for example, had entered a hairpin turn going hopelessly too fast. He had a choice: go over the railing or lay the bike down. With brakes tightly squeezed, he laid the bike down and skidded for some distance on the asphalt. His T-shirt rolled up his back, and he received quite a road rash, including embedded bits of small gravel and tar.

Like any unprepared Scout troop, our only cleaning agent in the first-aid kit was alcohol. As I watched his friends begin to clean the wounds on his back with the alcohol, I simply could not bear to watch. The pain must have been excruciating, and I could not stand to see my son suffer.

I know that Heavenly Father hurt at the sight of His Sons suffering. I know that both Heavenly Father and His Son love us.

President Uchtdorf summarized Gods love for us this way:

&lt;i&gt;Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, Gods love encompasses us completely.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy, pure, and indescribable love. We are important to God not because of our resume but because we are His children. He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken. Gods love is so great that He loves even the proud, the selfish, the arrogant, and the wicked.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What this means is that, regardless of our current state, there is hope for us. No matter our distress, no matter our sorrow, no matter our mistakes, our infinitely compassionate Heavenly Father desires that we draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us.&lt;/i&gt; [See D&amp;amp;C 88:63.] ["The Love of God," 2223]

In conclusion I testify that God our Heavenly Father loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son Jesus Christ.

Im grateful to have had the opportunity of attending BYU those many years ago. Im grateful for the Spirit that is here both then and now. I truly am.

So here is my question: What are you going to do? I pray that you might feel inspired this season to use Heavenly Fathers love for you as a verb. And I pray that what you need to do will be revealed to you through prayer. The Primary children have it right:

&lt;i&gt;I know my Father lives and loves me too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me it is true,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;And tells me it is true.&lt;/i&gt;

["I Know My Father Lives," &lt;i&gt;Hymns, &lt;/i&gt;1985, no. 302]

I add my testimony that it is true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I testify that God, our Heavenly Father, loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son, Jesus Christ. Like Alma, "I testify unto you that I do know that these things . . . are true. . . . They are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God" (Alma 5:4546). I know these things because of my own journey. And if Heavenly Father loves me and knows of me - since He is no respecter of persons - He loves you as well.</p>
<p>My purpose today is to share with you five facets of my testimony that show God loves us. These are simple and quite personal. I pray that your testimony of Gods love for you will grow as you think of your own experiences and that together we may receive the "word of truth" through the Holy Ghost (D&amp;C 50:17). I hope that as I speak, you will contemplate the many ways that God loves you. As I conclude today, I will ask you a question: "So what are you going to do?"</p>
<p><b>First:</b> I testify that God loves us because He grants unto us the revelator known as the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>It was October of 1972, a clear and sunny Sunday. I was a freshman at BYU. I rode my bicycle up Provo Canyon to Upper Falls. There I contemplated what in the world I was doing here. You see, I came to BYU as a nonmember. Why? Well, several friends at high school were going to BYU, and they simply invited me along. I applied to BYU, and when my parents and I visited campus, coming from smoggy and dry Southern California, we were sold. I knew very little about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints except that they didnt smoke or drink.</p>
<p>I had arrived on campus a week or so early to attend a late summer honors program. There I met my first roommate, Rahn Price. After a long day we were ready to go to sleep in our room in Deseret Towers (may they rest in peace). Then something unusual happened. Rahn rolled out of bed, knelt at his bedside, and prayed silently. I didnt know what to do. I was quite astonished. I finally said my own prayer:</p>
<p><i>Now I lay me down to sleep,</i></p>
<p><i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep;</i></p>
<p><i>Should I die before I wake,</i></p>
<p><i>I pray the Lord my soul to take.</i></p>
<p><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>I was done well before he was. Much later, Rahn said that was the most awkward prayer he had ever said. However, Im grateful that he did say that prayer.</p>
<p>As the semester began, I learned about agency from a Book of Mormon teacher named Bruce Hafen. I learned of the Atonement. Although I had grown up in a Christian church and was raised by "goodly parents" (1 Nephi 1:1), these concepts were certainly deeper than the wading pool of doctrine I had grown up with.</p>
<p>Once the semester began, my friends in Helaman Halls invited me to church, but I respectfully declined. They did not pester me or make me feel out of place. On Sundays I would just do my own activities, limited as they were by a bicycle.</p>
<p>I found that agency - a topic I had been learning about in my Book of Mormon class - was interesting as presented in the dorms. It was fast Sunday (whatever that meant), and when my floor went off to church, I went down to the Cannon Center for a casual breakfast. But there was no breakfast because it was fast Sunday. I hadnt planned to fast, but it appeared that I would be fasting even though I hadnt planned on it. This was in the day when you didnt have refrigerators and microwave ovens in each dorm room. There was no food there. I was suddenly faced with my own mortality - I knew I was going to die. I figured I had just enough strength left to make it to some local restaurant. Der Wienerschnitzel was the closest. All I needed was a little food to tide me over until the obligatory fast Sunday concluded in the dorms. So I ordered about a dozen hot dogs. Ive been grateful to Der Weinerschnitzel ever since.</p>
<p>But thankfully I matured. With the help of Rahn, my other friends, Brother Hafen, and my own budding awareness of the beautiful doctrines of the gospel, a seed had been planted. And on that October Sunday morning at Upper Falls, I actually asked Heavenly Father a question - something I was not taught to do growing up. Like most, I was taught that you can ask for blessings. It had never really occurred to me to ask Heavenly Father a question, because that implied you expected an answer - that you expected God to actually hear your prayer and acknowledge it with some sort of communication. It wasnt even a question about the Church I had at that time. I wasnt ready for that just yet. It was a question about me: "What wouldst thou have me do?" For the first time in my life I felt what I knew in an instant was the Holy Ghost, that unmistakably distinct and identifiable feeling in my bosom that has since guided me in all matters spiritual and most temporal: a warmth - not alarming or acidic, but peaceful and calm - that gave me clarity and resolve. Like the answer cited by Sister Matsumori in Octobers general conference: "It felt like sunshine" (Vicki F. Matsumori, "Helping Others Recognize the Whisperings of the Spirit," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 10).</p>
<p>What was my answer? That I had a special mission to perform. I had no idea what that meant. It didnt matter at that time, because what I had found out that day was that God lives, that He knew who I was, and that, whatever He was doing at the time, He had answered my prayer through the Holy Ghost. Ive been grateful ever since and have tried to demonstrate that gratitude by serving Him. My view of the world had changed: from peering through a keyhole at life to having an eternal panorama opened to my heart and minds view.</p>
<p>If God loved me enough to answer my prayer, I know that He loves each of you.</p>
<p><b>Second:</b> I testify that God loves you because He restored the priesthood, and the Aaronic Priesthood in particular, to the earth. I testify that His love is manifest through the gift of the ministering of angels that can protect us and comfort us as we learn more about Him.</p>
<p>Since that day in October my heart was prepared to receive the gospel. I learned by study and also by faith. I noted that Rahn held the Aaronic Priesthood and was a priest in that priesthood. Through sacred experiences we had together, I know that the Aaronic Priesthood encompasses the power of God and the keys of the ministering of angels. I know that such keys are a gift to young men in the Church who love Him. It is something to be desired. At the time, I identified with Simon, the sorcerer of the New Testament, who said, "Give me also this power" (Acts 8:19). Although Simon spoke of the Melchizedek Priesthood, I was desiring this Aaronic Priesthood. I know that the priesthood - Melchizedek and Aaronic - is Gods love made manifest to us to protect and serve. When you return home soon and see those gangly young Aaronic Priesthood holders in your ward, you might remember to thank them for carrying the power of God within them.</p>
<p><b>Third:</b> I testify that Heavenly Father loves us because He blesses us so much as we try to serve Him. He meets us much more than halfway when we act on the smallest seed of faith. He blesses us all along our journey back to His presence when we incline our ear and heart toward Him.</p>
<p>December 2, 1972, was a clear and crisp day. It was the day of my baptism. All the guys on my floor in Helaman Halls were up early getting ready for the service. But of course nobody said a word to me. Its a guy thing - like baseball players who dont want to jinx a pitcher who goes into the seventh inning with a no-hitter. I was both amused and impressed.</p>
<p>Who but Rahn Price baptized me? I received the gift of the Holy Ghost, which spirit had led me to the place I was at that time (see D&amp;C 6:14). I received the priesthood and felt the whole armor of God. Thank you, Rahn. A few months later I was ordained a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood by Norm Nemrow. (You might know him as Professor Nemrow here at BYU.) Thank you, Norm.</p>
<p>I was soon called as a home teacher. I was excited to serve with this Aaronic Priesthood that I had so much desired. One evening I had a particularly vexing physics homework assignment to do. I also had home teaching appointments. For the first time I faced a test of my new faith. What to do? Up until that time intellect had been the king of my hill, my lofty aspiration. But now? How did faith work once you were baptized? Would Heavenly Father turn His attention elsewhere now that I was within the Church? I went home teaching. When I returned to my dorm room to tackle Physics 121, all I can say is that Heavenly Father magnified my efforts in a very personal and significant way. I had not known that the Holy Ghost could teach physics. Ive never forgotten that lesson of being blessed beyond what I merited at the time. I was strengthened, confirmed in my faith, and encouraged.</p>
<p>King Benjamin put it this way:</p>
<p><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another - I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i></p>
<p><i>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</i></p>
<p><i>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</i></p>
<p><i>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</i> [Mosiah 2:2124]</p>
<p>Heavenly Father blesses us so that our seeds of faith can grow all of our lives to produce a harvest of happiness as we put the kingdom of God first and allow everything else to follow (see Matthew 6:33). The Lord said, "I will go before you and be your rearward; and I will be in your midst, and you shall not be confounded" (D&amp;C 49:27). I agree with Nephi, who said, "My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep" (2 Nephi 4:20). Each effort I make, no matter how small, is blessed greatly. God is truly generous with His love.</p>
<p>My faith was tried more seriously as I considered what to do about a full-time mission as a convert to the Church. I testify that as I exerted my faith, Heavenly Father strengthened my heart and melted the hearts of my parents, who had been adamantly opposed to my serving. But Heavenly Father went before my face and softened their hearts. I was able to serve with their blessing, and in giving back some of the love I had been given, as I served, I received, as usual, more blessings than I deserved.</p>
<p>I know that God will support you as you look to Him in every good thing. Hes got your back! Selfless service at any time increases our gratitude for God.</p>
<p><b>Fourth:</b> I testify that God loves us because He wants us to have everything that He has; He puts no limits on how much we can learn, grow, and progress. Our friend Stephen Covey calls it an "abundance mentality" versus a "scarcity mentality." Heavenly Father calls it the "plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8), the plan that can "bring to pass [our] immortality and eternal life" (Moses 1:39).</p>
<p>I remember when I walked upstairs in the original Harold B. Lee Library that in the stairwell I was confronted with the scripture "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 88:118). I was initially shocked at such a thing, but after my October experience and others like it, I came to know that there is no limit to how much we can learn, love, and live. William W. Phelps put it this way in verses 4 and 5 of his hymn:</p>
<p><i>There is no end to virtue;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to might;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to wisdom;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to light.</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to union;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to youth;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to priesthood;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to truth.</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to glory;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to love;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to being;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no death above.</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to glory;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to love;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no end to being;</i></p>
<p><i>There is no death above.</i></p>
<p>["If You Could Hie to Kolob," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 284]</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf recently summarized:</p>
<p><i>Our Father in Heaven has given us, His children, much more than any mortal mind can comprehend. Under His direction the Great Jehovah created this wondrous world we live in. God the Father watches over us, fills our hearts with breathtaking joy, brightens our darkest hours with blessed peace, distills upon our minds precious truths, shepherds us through times of distress, rejoices when we rejoice, and answers our righteous petitions.</i></p>
<p><i>He offers to His children the promise of a glorious and infinite existence and has provided a way for us to progress in knowledge and glory until we receive a fulness of joy. He has promised us all that He has.</i> [Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Love of God," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 22]</p>
<p>Were really tested with this concept as parents. Our oldest daughter has borne the brunt of much of our learning. (Come to think about it, though, our other three children didnt fare much better.) But as an active teenager, she would ask if she could go do this or that with her friends. Her requests were always reasonable, and she reminds us often that we were lucky that she even asked. But I remember once telling her no. She, of course, wanted to know why. I said, "Because Im your father, and I figure every once in awhile I should exercise that right and just say no." Well, how silly that was! Heavenly Father doesnt do that because He doesnt exercise such capricious constraints. She and I talked for quite awhile that night because she justifiably called me on my section 121 violation (see verses 3946). So I let her go and demonstrated my love and trust for her.</p>
<p>In addition to Heavenly Father not constraining us capriciously, I know that He loves us because He is anxious to impart all knowledge into our hands:</p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;C 88:79]</p>
<p>The knowledge that comes by the Holy Ghost through faith and prayer could be very useful to you in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>Fifth: I testify that God loves us because He sent His Son to atone for our sins and for the sins of all humankind everywhere. This is the most powerful manifestation of all. I felt it first as I prepared for baptism and now each week as I prepare to receive the sacrament.</p>
<p>The Atonement has been written about for centuries by prophets both ancient and modern, but is it written in our hearts? The Atonement is not an academic abstract that is learned like the multiplication tables. If we are prepared, like Nephi and Enos, the Atonement can sink deep in our hearts and fill us with wonder (see 1 Nephi 1114; Enos 1:3).</p>
<p>The manner of receiving the teaching of the Atonement is illustrated with the examples of Nephi and his elder-in-age but younger-in-spirit brothers, Laman and Lemuel.</p>
<p>Nephi, in seeking an interpretation of his father Lehis dream, had a discourse with an angel:</p>
<p><i>And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.</i></p>
<p><i>And he said unto me: What desirest thou?</i></p>
<p><i>And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof. . . .</i></p>
<p>Its interesting that the angel didnt just tell Nephi the interpretation. As a matter of fact, the angel could have made a nice spreadsheet of the vision, with the symbols across the top in columns and the explanation in the next row. But instead:</p>
<p><i>It came to pass that he said unto me: Look! . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?</i></p>
<p><i>And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.</i></p>
<p><i>And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?</i></p>
<p><i>And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.</i></p>
<p><i>And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</i></p>
<p><i>And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.</i></p>
<p><i>And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</i></p>
<p>Well? Had the angel made a spreadsheet? No! Nephi experienced the answer:</p>
<p><i>And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.</i></p>
<p><i>And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</i> [1 Nephi 11:923]</p>
<p>The love of God is the most desirable and joyous to the soul. Later Nephi testified:</p>
<p><i>And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world. </i>[1 Nephi 11:33]</p>
<p>The Atonement had sunk deep into Nephis heart.</p>
<p>Contrast this with Laman and Lemuels experience. They had dismissed the visit of an angel (see 1 Nephi 3:31), did not believe the words of their father (see 1 Nephi 2:1112), and found "the truth to be hard" (1 Nephi 16:2). When they asked Nephi about the interpretation of each element of the dream, Nephi simply gave them the spreadsheet explanation. Although the Atonement had taken root in the fleshy portion of Nephis heart (see 2 Corinthians 3:3), the hardened hearts of Laman and Lemuel remained unchanged (see 1 Nephi 16:22).</p>
<p>The Atonement is a gift from Heavenly Father through His Son that we especially need to remember at this time of year. It was the ultimate gift of both the Father and the Son: of the Father because He allowed His Son to suffer; of the Son because of what He did for us. Even football fans know the most famous scripture of all:</p>
<p><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i> [John 3:16]</p>
<p>A glimpse of our Heavenly Fathers anguish came to me several years ago during a high-adventure trip with my oldest son and several members of his priests quorum. We had gone to the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. One of the activities the boys wanted to do was ride their bicycles on the paved road down from the top of Mount Constitution. Ive done a bit of riding in my life, and I encouraged the boys to first ride up the mountain so they could remember where the gravel, the cracks in the pavement, the tightest turns, and other such potential hazards were. But of course that was too hard. So we took all the boys and the bikes to the top and all started down. I came down last, and I helped pick up each boy as each crashed at a different location. My son, for example, had entered a hairpin turn going hopelessly too fast. He had a choice: go over the railing or lay the bike down. With brakes tightly squeezed, he laid the bike down and skidded for some distance on the asphalt. His T-shirt rolled up his back, and he received quite a road rash, including embedded bits of small gravel and tar.</p>
<p>Like any unprepared Scout troop, our only cleaning agent in the first-aid kit was alcohol. As I watched his friends begin to clean the wounds on his back with the alcohol, I simply could not bear to watch. The pain must have been excruciating, and I could not stand to see my son suffer.</p>
<p>I know that Heavenly Father hurt at the sight of His Sons suffering. I know that both Heavenly Father and His Son love us.</p>
<p>President Uchtdorf summarized Gods love for us this way:</p>
<p><i>Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, Gods love encompasses us completely.</i></p>
<p><i>He loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy, pure, and indescribable love. We are important to God not because of our resume but because we are His children. He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken. Gods love is so great that He loves even the proud, the selfish, the arrogant, and the wicked.</i></p>
<p><i>What this means is that, regardless of our current state, there is hope for us. No matter our distress, no matter our sorrow, no matter our mistakes, our infinitely compassionate Heavenly Father desires that we draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us.</i> [See D&amp;C 88:63.] ["The Love of God," 2223]</p>
<p>In conclusion I testify that God our Heavenly Father loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Im grateful to have had the opportunity of attending BYU those many years ago. Im grateful for the Spirit that is here both then and now. I truly am.</p>
<p>So here is my question: What are you going to do? I pray that you might feel inspired this season to use Heavenly Fathers love for you as a verb. And I pray that what you need to do will be revealed to you through prayer. The Primary children have it right:</p>
<p><i>I know my Father lives and loves me too.</i><i>The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me it is true,</i><i>And tells me it is true.</i></p>
<p>["I Know My Father Lives," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 302]</p>
<p>I add my testimony that it is true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In preparing my remarks for today, I could not help remembering a recent experience of mine.
Some months ago, I enjoyed the privilege of presiding at a stake conference alongside Elder Donald J. Keyes, one of our noble Area Seventies. During the course of the Saturday evening session - often one of the highlights of a stake conference - we were required to adjust our program at short notice because of the inclusion of some additional speakers. In view of the fact that a duet, sung by a young couple, was to be moved in the program to follow Elder Keyess remarks and precede mine, I accordingly quietly whispered the proposed change in the program to him.
After doing so, it was quickly apparent that he had not fully grasped what I had just said, which required me to repeat my message a second time. Unfortunately, this time, and to my dismay, his lack of understanding was now amplified by a look of incredulity and utter disbelief. Realizing now that I had somehow failed in my attempt to clearly convey the change in our program, I repeated my message in a manner that could not be mistaken: I said, and this time more clearly and slowly than I had done previously, but with some added emphasis, "Don, the duet will be sung between you and me!"
This time my message hit the mark, for now his incredulity and disbelief were replaced by a nervous giggle and a hint of terror.
I then reviewed carefully in my mind what I had just said and at last realized my terrible error: When I had said, "The duet will be sung between us," he had taken my words literally. In other words, he had understood that the duet would be sung by the two of us!
I am pleased to reassure all of you here today that neither I, nor President Samuelson, have any intention of singing any duet, anywhere, at anytime, to anyone!
My beloved brothers and sisters, it is truly a rare privilege to be in your presence today. As I speak, our children and their families are viewing this broadcast in our home, back in South Africa, where it is just after eight o clock in the evening. Just think about the power of modern technology! One day, when I am released from this calling, Diane and I expect to sit alongside our children in our home in Featherbrooke, South Africa, and continue to enjoy the blessings of these great gatherings via satellite broadcast.
I am pleased to convey the love and greetings of the First Presidency to you. Alongside your parents and loved ones, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as stewards of the keys of the kingdom of God, have a deep interest in you and an abiding faith in your progress and development.
When one considers the glorious work of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, nothing surpasses in importance and power the restoration of a true knowledge and understanding of God the Eternal Father and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. In the world in which we</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Several years ago, during a challenging and hectic period in my life, I read a statement by President Brigham Young that has meant a great deal to me ever since. He said:
When you . . . see our Father, you will see a being with whom you have long been acquainted, and He will receive you into His arms, and you will be ready to fall into His embrace and kiss Him. . . . You will be so glad and joyful. . . . When you are qualified and purified, . . . you can endure the glory of eternity. [JD 4:5455]
How blessed we are to know what President Young taught us about our Heavenly Father - what kind of a being He is, what He is really like. How many people over the space of thousands of years have not even known that there is a Father in Heaven? How many individuals lives might have been different if they could only have known about our loving, merciful, and caring Heavenly Father? Indeed, how blessed we are to have such teachings that center on the nature of our Father in Heaven. It is about God, our Eternal Father, that I wish to speak today.
The first article or principle in our declaration of faith as Latter-day Saints states, "We believe in God, the Eternal Father" (Articles of Faith 1:1). I do not think it is accidental or coincidental that this statement comes first in our 13 Articles of Faith.
The Prophet Joseph Smith said: "It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God" (Teachings, 345). In other words, one of the foundation stones of the restored gospel is a knowledge of what kind of being God actually is. But not only do we need to understand what kind of being God is, we must come to know God. In the same sermon from which we just quoted, the Prophet Joseph further stated, "If any man does not know God, . . . he will realize that he has not eternal life; for there can be eternal life on no other principle" (Teachings, 344). In His great high-priestly or Intercessory Prayer, the Savior confirmed that life eternal was to "know . . . the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [the Father] hast sent" (John 17:3).
Thus everything of sacred significance connected with our future rests on both our coming to know about God the Eternal Father and, ultimately, our coming to know Him. "If men do not comprehend the character of God," said Joseph Smith, "they do not comprehend themselves" (Teachings, 343). God and men are of the same divine, eternal species, and if we do not comprehend the nature of God, we cannot appreciate our divine parentage nor the very real potential we possess to become like our heavenly parents.
God Must Be Revealed
Coming to know God is not for the spiritually lazy. He can only be known through revelation. And powerful personal revelation, as many of you know, is predicated upon righteous living and spiritual discipline. Elder Bruce R. McConki</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to David Whitmer, we are told that eternal life "is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;C 14:7). When we understand that the entire work and glory of the Savior is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39), a most significant question for us is "How do we obtain eternal life?" The Savior provided the key in His great intercessory prayer recorded by John, the beloved apostle: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). The key, then, to eternal life is to know God the Father and Jesus Christ.
Here at BYU, as at any university, we are engaged in the business of knowing. Our knowledge is tested in exams, papers, laboratories, and applied settings. If you are like me, some of those things we know just long enough to take a test for, and there are other things we know and retain long past any examination.
I believe that the "knowing" spoken of by the Savior is far above a knowing of facts, techniques, or theories. To know Jesus Christ requires a different kind of knowledge. To gain eternal life we cannot merely be acquainted with Him or recall some factoid about His life as if we were playing a trivia game. We cannot simply read about Him. Knowing Him is more than knowing His doctrine and certainly more than professing His doctrine. The New Testament tells of many who spent time with Jesus, who heard His words and even saw His miracles, but who, sadly, never knew Him. Knowing Him in the way that He has counseled and pled with us to know Him requires everything we are and, in the end, changes our beings forever.
Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone described the transforming power of knowing Him in this way:
One who truly knows Him does not - nor cannot, nor will not - forget Him, ever. Whatever daily task, pleasure, sport, or activity we may be involved in, His desires are supreme in our lives. If we become careless in the way we wear the garment, haphazardly use the Lord&#8217;s name, or serve only socially in the Church, we clearly do not "know" the Master. We might even know the Church is true, but actually knowing Jesus Christ would dramatically change our conduct. We would no longer have a disposition to do evil; rather, we would feel absolutely submissive to His will and turn our lives over to Him. Knowing Him is much, much more than knowing about Him. [Vaughn J. Featherstone, The Incomparable Christ: Our Master and Model (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1995), 26]
We gain understanding of the power of knowing Him when we reflect on His visit to the American continent. What happened changed the way those people "knew" the Savior. His words had been available to them for their entire lifetimes. Believers among them had taught of Him and prophesied of Him. But when the people really "knew Him," their </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My years as a student at BYU were in the decade of the 1960s. It is hard for me to think of it as historical times, but I realize that for most of you, those years seem like ancient history. If you know something of that history, you will remember that it was a turbulent decade in the United States. There was much of dissension and protest and rebellion. Many began to question the legitimacy of authority - any authority. The words the Establishment became a disparaging label for government and college officials and the institutions they represented. We were advised by some younger sages, quite full of their own wisdom, not to trust anyone over 30, including parents. By the way, these "wise men" are now over 30 themselves, so I suppose we can safely ignore their advice.
This opposition to authority did not fade away with the end of that decade. If anything, the tendency has intensified. Some claim that any exercise of authority is, per se, abusive and repressive, that it infringes on their rights. You have noted, I am sure, the persistent focus on rights and the scant attention paid to responsibilities. There are those today who challenge even the authority of God. Because it is now so pervasive, if you are not careful, something of that attitude could seep into and infect your own feelings. I want today to reinforce in your mind and in your heart the love you feel for your Heavenly Father. I want to reinforce your allegiance to God and your desire to be a fit and loyal subject in His kingdom.
At one point in the book of Helaman, the narrator, presumably Mormon, paused in his account to reflect on the proclivity of the people to reject God in times of prosperity. As the result of a severe famine, the Nephites had, at the end of the 76th year of the judges, turned to God. Within a brief nine years, however, "they began again to forget the Lord their God. . . . They did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction" (Helaman 11:3637). Contemplating this sad turning away that had occurred in less than a decades time, Mormon lamented:
O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!
Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdoms paths!
Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide. [Helaman 12:46]
