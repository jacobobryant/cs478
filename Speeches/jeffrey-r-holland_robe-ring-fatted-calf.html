  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Recently I was invited by President Bishop of the Missionary Training Center to address the nearly two thousand missionaries in residence there. I accepted because I always assume it is impossible to give a poor talk at the MTC. They will take notes and make scriptural cross-references if you read them the telephone directory. Plus I love to hear them sing. So I went.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Missionary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Following prayers, hymns, announcements and introductions, I gave them a rousing forty-minute reading of the telephone directory, proving that indeed one &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; give a poor talk to these missionaries. But, generous Christians that they are, several came up following my remarks to visit briefly and discuss my message. (Actually most of them either wanted tickets to a basketball game or to complain about the parking ticket “hold” that Financial Services had put on their temple recommends.) I visited with many of them and the minutes stretched into many minutes and then finally into nearly an hour. During that time I noticed one young elder hanging around the outer rim of the circle as all the other missionaries came and went.

Finally the traffic thinned out, and he stepped forward. “Do you remember me?” he asked.

“No,” I said, “I’m sorry I don’t. Tell me your name.”

He replied, “My name is Elder ___________.” His eyes searched mine for recognition, but I just didn’t know who this young man was.

Summoning his courage for the ultimate revelation he said, “Hinckley Hall—A Faithful Friend Is a Strong Defense.” Then I knew who he was. That little coded phrase may not ring any bells for you, but it meant something to him and he knew it meant something to me.

On September 7, 1982, I stood in this exact spot and gave the only angry public spanking I have ever given a group of BYU students. The title of my remarks for that back-to-school message was “A Faithful Friend Is a Strong Defense.” I spoke of an offense, a felony—falsifying government documents—which had been committed in Hinckley Hall the April before and which had been widely covered by the press. Five months had passed but I was still hurting. Time had not soothed me.

I spoke of that incident publicly—without mentioning the names of the participants—because I care about matters of morality and honor and personal virtue at BYU. I wanted it clear then (and now, if anyone is still wondering) that the behavior of every student at Brigham Young University matters very much to me and to what this school stands for. So I said my piece and, for all intents and purposes, forgot about it.

But, as you might guess, it was not easy for the students involved. Not only were there the burdens of university and Church actions, but the civil laws made an indelible stroke across the record of some of these young lives. There were tears and courts and sentences and probations. Legally it had been about as much of a nightmare as a college freshman could have foreseen. Obviously it was &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; of a nightmare than they could have foreseen because the sorrow and remorse over their “prank”—I put the word in quotation marks—was deep and rending.

I recall that very unsavory experience for you this morning simply to put a happy ending on one young man’s very difficult experience. His father wrote me later and said how much courage it had taken for him to come up and talk with me at the MTC, but he said his son wanted me to know of his effort to make things right. It had not been easy for him to get a mission call. Not only were there all the court-imposed sanctions and Church restrictions, but there was the terrible personal burden of guilt. But he wanted to serve a mission both because it was the right thing to do and because it was a way for him to say to the Church, the government, the university and all who cared about him, “I’m back. I made a serious mistake but I’m back. I am making up lost ground. I’ve still got a chance.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Prayer in My Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As you know, there are other painful stories about transgressions and heartache on this campus, stories involving very serious but usually less public mistakes. The prayer in my heart this morning is to help some of you, any of you, even one of you, have a similarly happy ending to your story, a story which you may feel is pocked and blemished beyond repair for some past mistake you have made. In short, I wish to speak to you of the redeeming love of Christ and why His gospel is indeed the “good news.” Because of Him we can rise above past problems, blot them out, watch them die if we are willing to have it so.

I am not sure what your most painful memories might be. I’m certain there are lots of problems we could all list. Some may be sins among the most serious God Himself has listed. Others may be less serious disappointments, including a poor start in school, or a difficult relationship with your family, or personal pain with a friend. Whatever the list, it’s bound to be long when we add up all the dumb things we’ve done. And my greatest fear is that you will not believe in other chances, that you will not understand repentance, that on some days you will not believe in any future at all.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macbeth’s Guilt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In what may well be literature’s most extreme and chilling observation of such debilitating, unassuaged guilt, we watch Macbeth—cousin of the king, masterful, strong, honored, and honorable—descend through a horrible series of bloody deeds by which his very soul is increasingly “tortured by an agony which [knows no] . . . repose” (A. C. Bradley,&lt;i&gt;Shakespearean Tragedy&lt;/i&gt;, [New York: Fawcett, 1967], p. 276). Shapes of terror appear before his eyes, and the sounds of hell clamor in his ears.

His guilty heart and tormented conscience rend his days and terrify his nights so incessantly that he says to his physician:

&lt;i&gt;Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Raze out the written troubles of the brain,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And with some sweet oblivious antidote&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Which weighs upon the heart?&lt;/i&gt;

The doctor shakes his head over such diseases of the soul, and says:

&lt;i&gt;Therein the patient&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Must minister to himself.&lt;/i&gt;
[5.3.40–47]

But the anguish continues unabated until Macbeth says on the day he will die:

&lt;i&gt;Out, out, brief candle!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And then is heard no more. It is a tale&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Signifying nothing.&lt;/i&gt; [5.5.23–28]

Macbeth’s murders are sins too strong for the kind of transgression you and I might discuss at BYU. But I believe the despair of his final hopelessness can be applied at least in part to our own circumstances. Unless we believe in repentance and restoration, unless we believe there can be a way back from our mistakes—whether those sins be sexual or social or civil or academic, whether they be great or small—unless we believe we can start over on solid ground with our past put behind us and genuine hope for the future—in short, if we cannot believe in the compassion of Christ and His redemptive love, then I think we in our own way are as hopeless as Macbeth and our view of life just as depressing. We do become shadows, feeble players on a perverse stage, in a tale told by an idiot. And unfortunately, in such a burdened state, we are the idiots.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Miracle of Forgiveness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As he began to write of what he would call the “miracle of forgiveness,” President Kimball said:

&lt;i&gt;I had made up my mind that I would never write a book&lt;/i&gt; [but] &lt;i&gt;. . . when I come in contact almost daily with broken homes, delinquent children, corrupt governments, and apostate groups, and realize that all these problems are the result of sin, I want to shout with Alma: “O . . . that I might go forth . . . with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people.” (Alma 29:1.)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Hence this book indicates the seriousness of breaking God’s commandments; shows that sin can bring only sorrow, remorse, disappointment, and anguish; and warns that the small indiscretions evolve into larger ones and finally into major transgressions which bring heavy penalties . . . .&lt;/i&gt;

[But] having come to recognize their deep sin, many have tended to surrender hope, not having a clear knowledge of the scriptures and of the redeeming power of Christ.

[So I also] &lt;i&gt;write to make the joyous affirmation that man can be literally transformed by his own repentance and by God’s forgiveness. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It is my humble hope that . . . &lt;/i&gt;[those] &lt;i&gt;who are suffering the baleful effects of sin may be helped to find the way from darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope, and from spiritual death to eternal life.&lt;/i&gt; [Spencer W. Kimball, Preface, &lt;i&gt;The Miracle of Forgiveness,&lt;/i&gt; p. x–xii; emphasis added]

That is what I want for you this year, this new year and new semester, at BYU. Without ever minimizing the seriousness of some of our mistakes, I want to give to you today the message that we can be washed and pronounced clean if we will but honor the Lamb of God. From relatively innocent mistakes or disadvantages in life to the most serious of spiritual sins, the gospel of Jesus Christ gives us a way back. We must believe in movement “from darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alma’s Return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What if Alma had not come back? He had made serious mistakes, more serious perhaps than we know. He is described as “a very wicked and an idolatrous man,” one who sought to “destroy the church” and who delighted in “rebelling against God” (Mosiah 27:8, 10, 11). He was, in short, “the very vilest of sinners” (Mosiah 28:4). The strongest denunciation comes from his own lips when he said to his son Helaman,

&lt;i&gt;I had rebelled against my God. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction . . . . So great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 36:13–14]

He may not have been Macbeth, but that is a frightening description of a man’s standing before God. But he came back. Not without anguish and suffering and fear, not without “wandering through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death.” But he paid the full price and came back on the strength of Christ’s love. And every life thereafter, both in the Book of Mormon itself and in our generation, has been enriched because of the life Alma then lived.

What if he had not had the courage to make amends, however severe, and had remained at the far end of a road he should never have taken? What if, having found himself in such a mess he had despairingly thrown his hands in the air and said, “Out, brief candle. I am a poor player upon a stage. My life is a tale told by an idiot. It has been full of sound and fury, and now it signifies nothing”?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter’s Strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Or what if a mistake or two had so crippled Peter that he had not come back, stronger than ever, after the crucifixion and resurrection of the Master? A few years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of Peter’s struggle. After recounting the events of Jesus’ ordeal in accusations, mock trials, and imprisonment, and Peter’s remorseful acquiescence to it, he said:

&lt;i&gt;As I have read this account my heart goes out to Peter. So many of us are so much like him. We pledge our loyalty; we affirm our determination to be of good courage; we declare, sometimes even publicly, that come what may we will do the right thing, that we will stand for the right cause, that we will be true to ourselves and to others.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then the pressures begin to build. Sometimes these are social pressures. Sometimes they are personal appetites. Sometimes they are false ambitions. There is a weakening of the will. There is a softening of discipline. There is capitulation. And then there is remorse, self-accusation, and bitter tears of regret.&lt;/i&gt;

Well, if Peter’s story were to have ended there, with him cursing and swearing and saying, “I know not the man,” surely his would be among the most pathetic in all scripture.

But Peter came back.

He squared his shoulders and stiffened his resolve and made up for lost ground. He took command of a frightened little band of Church members. He preached such a moving sermon on the day of Pentecost that three thousand in the audience applied for baptism. Days later five thousand heard him and were baptized. With John, he healed the lame man at the gate of the temple. Faith in Peter’s faith brought the sick into the streets on their beds of affliction “that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them” (Acts 5:15). He fearlessly spoke for his brethren when they were arraigned before the Sanhedrin and when they were cast into prison. He entertained angels and received the vision that led to carrying the gospel to the Gentiles. He became in every sense the rock Christ promised he would be. Of such a life President Hinckley said:

&lt;i&gt;I pray that you may draw comfort and resolution from the example of Peter who, though he had walked daily with Jesus, in an hour of extremity denied both the Lord and the testimony which he carried in his own heart. But he rose above this, and became a mighty defender and a powerful advocate. So too, there is a way for you to turn about and . . .&lt;/i&gt;[build] &lt;i&gt;the kingdom of God.&lt;/i&gt; [“And Peter Went Out and Wept Bitterly,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1979, pp. 65–67]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Help Is Needed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Of course, one of the added tragedies in transgression is that even if &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; make the effort to change, to try again, to come back, others often insist upon leaving the old labels with us.

I grew up in the same town with a boy who had no father and precious few of the other blessings of life. The young men in our community found it easy to tease and taunt and bully him. And in the process of it all he made some mistakes, though I cannot believe his mistakes were more serious than those of his Latter-day Saint friends who made life so miserable for him. He began to drink and smoke, and the gospel principles which had never meant much to him now meant even less. He had been cast in a role by LDS friends who should have known better and he began to play the part perfectly. Soon he drank even more, went to school even less, and went to Church not at all. Then one day he was gone. Some said that they thought he had joined the army.

That was about 1959 or so. Fifteen or sixteen years later he came home. At least he tried to come home. He had found the significance of the gospel in his life. He had married a wonderful girl, and they had a beautiful family. But he discovered something upon his return. He had changed, but some of his old friends hadn’t—and they were unwilling to let him escape his past.

This was hard for him and hard for his family. They bought a little home and started a small business, but they struggled both personally and professionally and finally moved away. For reasons that don’t need to be detailed here, the story goes on to a very unhappy ending. He died a year ago at age 44. That’s too young to die these days, and it’s certainly too young to die away from home.

When a battered, weary swimmer tries valiantly to get back to shore, after having fought strong winds and rough waves which he should never have challenged in the first place, those of us who might have had better judgment, or perhaps just better luck, ought not to row out to his side, beat him with our oars, and shove his head back underwater. That’s not what boats were made for. But some of us do that to each other.

In general conference a few years ago Elder David B. Haight told us that—

&lt;i&gt;Arturo Toscanini, the late, famous conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, received a brief, crumpled letter from a lonely sheepherder in the remote mountain area of Wyoming:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“Mr. Conductor: I have only two possessions—a radio and an old violin. The batteries in my radio are getting low and will soon die. My violin is so out of tune I can’t use it. Please help me. Next Sunday when you begin your concert, sound a loud ‘A’ so I can tune my ‘A’ string; then I can tune the other strings. When my radio batteries are dead, I’ll have my violin.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;At the beginning of his next nationwide radio concert from Carnegie Hall, Toscanini announced: “For a dear friend and listener back in the mountains of Wyoming the orchestra will now sound an ‘A.’” The musicians all joined together in a perfect “A.”&lt;/i&gt;

[That] &lt;i&gt;lonely sheepherder only needed one note, just a little help to get back in tune; . . . he needed someone who cared to assist him with &lt;/i&gt;[just]&lt;i&gt; one string; &lt;/i&gt;[after that]&lt;i&gt; the others would be easy.&lt;/i&gt; [“People to People,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1981, p. 54]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;William Wines Phelps’s Way Back&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In the early years of the Church the Prophet Joseph Smith had no more faithful aide than William Wines Phelps. Brother Phelps, a former newspaper editor, had joined the Church in Kirtland and was of such assistance to those early leaders that they sent him as one of the first Latter-day Saints to the New Jerusalem—Jackson County, Missouri. There he was called by the Lord to the stake presidency of that “center stake of Zion.”

But then troubles developed. First they were largely ecclesiastical aberrations but later there were financial improprieties. Things became so serious that the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that if Phelps did not repent, he would be “removed out of [his] place” (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 2:511). He did not repent and was excommunicated on March 10, 1838.

The Prophet Joseph and others immediately tried to love Phelps back into the fold, but he would have nothing of it. Then in the fall of that violent year W. W. Phelps, along with others, signed a deadly, damaging affidavit against the Prophet and other leaders of the Church. The result was quite simply that Joseph Smith was sentenced to be publicly executed on the town square in Far West, Missouri, Friday morning, November 2, 1838. Through the monumental courage of General Alexander Doniphan, the Prophet was miraculously spared the execution Phelps and others had precipitated, but he was not spared spending five months—November through April—in several Missouri prisons, the most noted of which was the pit known ironically as Liberty Jail.

I do not need to recount for you the suffering of the Saints through that period. The anguish of those not captive was in many ways more severe than those imprisoned. The persecution intensified until the Saints sought yet again to find another refuge from the storm. With Joseph in chains, praying for their safety and giving some direction by letter, they made their way toward Commerce, Illinois, a malaria swamp on the Mississippi River where they would try once more to build the city of Zion. And much of this travail, this torment and heartache, was due to men of their own brotherhood like W. W. Phelps.

But we’re speaking today of happy endings. Two very difficult years later, with great anguish and remorse of conscience, Phelps wrote to Joseph Smith in Nauvoo.

&lt;i&gt;Brother Joseph: . . . I am as the prodigal son. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have passed. . . .&lt;/i&gt; [I] &lt;i&gt;ask my old brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death, yet I will die with them, for their God is my God. The least place with them is enough for me, yea, it is bigger and better than all Babylon. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me. . . . I have done wrong and I am sorry. . . . I ask forgiveness. . . . I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet.&lt;/i&gt;

In an instant the Prophet wrote back. I know of no private document or personal response in the life of Joseph Smith—or anyone else, for that matter—which so powerfully demonstrates the magnificence of his soul. There is a lesson here for every one of us who claims to be a disciple of Christ.

He wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Dear Brother Phelps: . . . You may in some measure realize what my feelings . . . were when we read your letter . . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We have suffered much in consequence of your behavior—the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us . . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God’s dear children, and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and by diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our God, and your God, and to the Church of Jesus Christ.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For friends at first, are friends again at last.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yours as ever,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Joseph Smith, Jun.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 4:141–42, 162–64]

It only adds to the poignance of this particular prodigal’s return that exactly four years later—almost to the day—it would be W. W. Phelps selected to preach Joseph Smith’s funeral sermon in that terribly tense and emotional circumstance. Furthermore it would be W. W. Phelps who would memorialize the martyred prophet with his hymn of adoration, “Praise to the Man.”

Having been the foolish swimmer pulled back to safety by the very man he had sought to destroy, Phelps must have had unique appreciation for the stature of the Prophet when he penned:

&lt;i&gt;Great is his glory and endless his priesthood.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ever and ever the keys he will hold.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Praise to the Man,” &lt;i&gt;Hymns&lt;/i&gt;, no. 147]

I requested that we sing a verse of that hymn this morning. Next time you sing it, remember what it meant to W. W. Phelps to be given another chance.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Prodigal Son&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Perhaps the most encouraging and compassionate parable in all of Holy Writ is the story of the prodigal son. I close with Mary Lyman Henrie’s poetic expression of it entitled “To Any Who Have Watched for a Son’s Returning.”

&lt;i&gt;He watched his son gather all the goods&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that were his lot,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;anxious to be gone from tending flocks,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the dullness of the fields.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He stood by the olive tree gate long&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;after the caravan disappeared&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;where the road climbs the hills&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on the far side of the valley,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;into infinity.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Through changing seasons he spent the light&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in a great chair, facing the far country,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and that speck of road on the horizon.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Mocking friends: “He will not come.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Whispering servants: “The old man&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;has lost his senses.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A chiding son: “You should not have let him go.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A grieving wife: “You need rest and sleep.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;She covered his drooping shoulders, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;his callused knees, when east winds blew chill, until that day . . . &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A form familiar, even at infinity,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in shreds, alone, stumbling over pebbles.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“When he was a great way off,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;His father saw him,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and had compassion, and ran,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”&lt;/i&gt; (Luke 15:20)
[&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; March 1983, p. 63]

God bless us to help each other come back home, where we will, in the presence of our Father, find waiting a robe, a ring, and a fatted calf, I pray in the name of Him who made it possible, even Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Recently I was invited by President Bishop of the Missionary Training Center to address the nearly two thousand missionaries in residence there. I accepted because I always assume it is impossible to give a poor talk at the MTC. They will take notes and make scriptural cross-references if you read them the telephone directory. Plus I love to hear them sing. So I went.</p>
<h2><b>The Missionary</b></h2>
<p>Following prayers, hymns, announcements and introductions, I gave them a rousing forty-minute reading of the telephone directory, proving that indeed one <i>can</i> give a poor talk to these missionaries. But, generous Christians that they are, several came up following my remarks to visit briefly and discuss my message. (Actually most of them either wanted tickets to a basketball game or to complain about the parking ticket “hold” that Financial Services had put on their temple recommends.) I visited with many of them and the minutes stretched into many minutes and then finally into nearly an hour. During that time I noticed one young elder hanging around the outer rim of the circle as all the other missionaries came and went.</p>
<p>Finally the traffic thinned out, and he stepped forward. “Do you remember me?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, “I’m sorry I don’t. Tell me your name.”</p>
<p>He replied, “My name is Elder ___________.” His eyes searched mine for recognition, but I just didn’t know who this young man was.</p>
<p>Summoning his courage for the ultimate revelation he said, “Hinckley Hall—A Faithful Friend Is a Strong Defense.” Then I knew who he was. That little coded phrase may not ring any bells for you, but it meant something to him and he knew it meant something to me.</p>
<p>On September 7, 1982, I stood in this exact spot and gave the only angry public spanking I have ever given a group of BYU students. The title of my remarks for that back-to-school message was “A Faithful Friend Is a Strong Defense.” I spoke of an offense, a felony—falsifying government documents—which had been committed in Hinckley Hall the April before and which had been widely covered by the press. Five months had passed but I was still hurting. Time had not soothed me.</p>
<p>I spoke of that incident publicly—without mentioning the names of the participants—because I care about matters of morality and honor and personal virtue at BYU. I wanted it clear then (and now, if anyone is still wondering) that the behavior of every student at Brigham Young University matters very much to me and to what this school stands for. So I said my piece and, for all intents and purposes, forgot about it.</p>
<p>But, as you might guess, it was not easy for the students involved. Not only were there the burdens of university and Church actions, but the civil laws made an indelible stroke across the record of some of these young lives. There were tears and courts and sentences and probations. Legally it had been about as much of a nightmare as a college freshman could have foreseen. Obviously it was <i>more</i> of a nightmare than they could have foreseen because the sorrow and remorse over their “prank”—I put the word in quotation marks—was deep and rending.</p>
<p>I recall that very unsavory experience for you this morning simply to put a happy ending on one young man’s very difficult experience. His father wrote me later and said how much courage it had taken for him to come up and talk with me at the MTC, but he said his son wanted me to know of his effort to make things right. It had not been easy for him to get a mission call. Not only were there all the court-imposed sanctions and Church restrictions, but there was the terrible personal burden of guilt. But he wanted to serve a mission both because it was the right thing to do and because it was a way for him to say to the Church, the government, the university and all who cared about him, “I’m back. I made a serious mistake but I’m back. I am making up lost ground. I’ve still got a chance.”</p>
<h2><b>The Prayer in My Heart</b></h2>
<p>As you know, there are other painful stories about transgressions and heartache on this campus, stories involving very serious but usually less public mistakes. The prayer in my heart this morning is to help some of you, any of you, even one of you, have a similarly happy ending to your story, a story which you may feel is pocked and blemished beyond repair for some past mistake you have made. In short, I wish to speak to you of the redeeming love of Christ and why His gospel is indeed the “good news.” Because of Him we can rise above past problems, blot them out, watch them die if we are willing to have it so.</p>
<p>I am not sure what your most painful memories might be. I’m certain there are lots of problems we could all list. Some may be sins among the most serious God Himself has listed. Others may be less serious disappointments, including a poor start in school, or a difficult relationship with your family, or personal pain with a friend. Whatever the list, it’s bound to be long when we add up all the dumb things we’ve done. And my greatest fear is that you will not believe in other chances, that you will not understand repentance, that on some days you will not believe in any future at all.</p>
<h2><b>Macbeth’s Guilt</b></h2>
<p>In what may well be literature’s most extreme and chilling observation of such debilitating, unassuaged guilt, we watch Macbeth—cousin of the king, masterful, strong, honored, and honorable—descend through a horrible series of bloody deeds by which his very soul is increasingly “tortured by an agony which [knows no] . . . repose” (A. C. Bradley,<i>Shakespearean Tragedy</i>, [New York: Fawcett, 1967], p. 276). Shapes of terror appear before his eyes, and the sounds of hell clamor in his ears.</p>
<p>His guilty heart and tormented conscience rend his days and terrify his nights so incessantly that he says to his physician:</p>
<p><i>Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,</i><br />
<i>Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,</i><br />
<i>Raze out the written troubles of the brain,</i><br />
<i>And with some sweet oblivious antidote</i><br />
<i>Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff</i><br />
<i>Which weighs upon the heart?</i></p>
<p>The doctor shakes his head over such diseases of the soul, and says:</p>
<p><i>Therein the patient</i><br />
<i>Must minister to himself.</i><br />
[5.3.40–47]</p>
<p>But the anguish continues unabated until Macbeth says on the day he will die:</p>
<p><i>Out, out, brief candle!</i><br />
<i>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player</i><br />
<i>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, </i><br />
<i>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</i><br />
<i>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, </i><br />
<i>Signifying nothing.</i> [5.5.23–28]</p>
<p>Macbeth’s murders are sins too strong for the kind of transgression you and I might discuss at BYU. But I believe the despair of his final hopelessness can be applied at least in part to our own circumstances. Unless we believe in repentance and restoration, unless we believe there can be a way back from our mistakes—whether those sins be sexual or social or civil or academic, whether they be great or small—unless we believe we can start over on solid ground with our past put behind us and genuine hope for the future—in short, if we cannot believe in the compassion of Christ and His redemptive love, then I think we in our own way are as hopeless as Macbeth and our view of life just as depressing. We do become shadows, feeble players on a perverse stage, in a tale told by an idiot. And unfortunately, in such a burdened state, we are the idiots.</p>
<h2><b>The Miracle of Forgiveness</b></h2>
<p>As he began to write of what he would call the “miracle of forgiveness,” President Kimball said:</p>
<p><i>I had made up my mind that I would never write a book</i> [but] <i>. . . when I come in contact almost daily with broken homes, delinquent children, corrupt governments, and apostate groups, and realize that all these problems are the result of sin, I want to shout with Alma: “O . . . that I might go forth . . . with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people.” (Alma 29:1.)</i></p>
<p><i>Hence this book indicates the seriousness of breaking God’s commandments; shows that sin can bring only sorrow, remorse, disappointment, and anguish; and warns that the small indiscretions evolve into larger ones and finally into major transgressions which bring heavy penalties . . . .</i></p>
<p>[But] having come to recognize their deep sin, many have tended to surrender hope, not having a clear knowledge of the scriptures and of the redeeming power of Christ.</p>
<p>[So I also] <i>write to make the joyous affirmation that man can be literally transformed by his own repentance and by God’s forgiveness. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>It is my humble hope that . . . </i>[those] <i>who are suffering the baleful effects of sin may be helped to find the way from darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope, and from spiritual death to eternal life.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, Preface, <i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i> p. x–xii; emphasis added]</p>
<p>That is what I want for you this year, this new year and new semester, at BYU. Without ever minimizing the seriousness of some of our mistakes, I want to give to you today the message that we can be washed and pronounced clean if we will but honor the Lamb of God. From relatively innocent mistakes or disadvantages in life to the most serious of spiritual sins, the gospel of Jesus Christ gives us a way back. We must believe in movement “from darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope.”</p>
<h2><b>Alma’s Return</b></h2>
<p>What if Alma had not come back? He had made serious mistakes, more serious perhaps than we know. He is described as “a very wicked and an idolatrous man,” one who sought to “destroy the church” and who delighted in “rebelling against God” (Mosiah 27:8, 10, 11). He was, in short, “the very vilest of sinners” (Mosiah 28:4). The strongest denunciation comes from his own lips when he said to his son Helaman,</p>
<p><i>I had rebelled against my God. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction . . . . So great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</i> [Alma 36:13–14]</p>
<p>He may not have been Macbeth, but that is a frightening description of a man’s standing before God. But he came back. Not without anguish and suffering and fear, not without “wandering through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death.” But he paid the full price and came back on the strength of Christ’s love. And every life thereafter, both in the Book of Mormon itself and in our generation, has been enriched because of the life Alma then lived.</p>
<p>What if he had not had the courage to make amends, however severe, and had remained at the far end of a road he should never have taken? What if, having found himself in such a mess he had despairingly thrown his hands in the air and said, “Out, brief candle. I am a poor player upon a stage. My life is a tale told by an idiot. It has been full of sound and fury, and now it signifies nothing”?</p>
<h2><b>Peter’s Strength</b></h2>
<p>Or what if a mistake or two had so crippled Peter that he had not come back, stronger than ever, after the crucifixion and resurrection of the Master? A few years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of Peter’s struggle. After recounting the events of Jesus’ ordeal in accusations, mock trials, and imprisonment, and Peter’s remorseful acquiescence to it, he said:</p>
<p><i>As I have read this account my heart goes out to Peter. So many of us are so much like him. We pledge our loyalty; we affirm our determination to be of good courage; we declare, sometimes even publicly, that come what may we will do the right thing, that we will stand for the right cause, that we will be true to ourselves and to others.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the pressures begin to build. Sometimes these are social pressures. Sometimes they are personal appetites. Sometimes they are false ambitions. There is a weakening of the will. There is a softening of discipline. There is capitulation. And then there is remorse, self-accusation, and bitter tears of regret.</i></p>
<p>Well, if Peter’s story were to have ended there, with him cursing and swearing and saying, “I know not the man,” surely his would be among the most pathetic in all scripture.</p>
<p>But Peter came back.</p>
<p>He squared his shoulders and stiffened his resolve and made up for lost ground. He took command of a frightened little band of Church members. He preached such a moving sermon on the day of Pentecost that three thousand in the audience applied for baptism. Days later five thousand heard him and were baptized. With John, he healed the lame man at the gate of the temple. Faith in Peter’s faith brought the sick into the streets on their beds of affliction “that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them” (Acts 5:15). He fearlessly spoke for his brethren when they were arraigned before the Sanhedrin and when they were cast into prison. He entertained angels and received the vision that led to carrying the gospel to the Gentiles. He became in every sense the rock Christ promised he would be. Of such a life President Hinckley said:</p>
<p><i>I pray that you may draw comfort and resolution from the example of Peter who, though he had walked daily with Jesus, in an hour of extremity denied both the Lord and the testimony which he carried in his own heart. But he rose above this, and became a mighty defender and a powerful advocate. So too, there is a way for you to turn about and . . .</i>[build] <i>the kingdom of God.</i> [“And Peter Went Out and Wept Bitterly,” <i>Ensign,</i> May 1979, pp. 65–67]</p>
<h2><b>Help Is Needed</b></h2>
<p>Of course, one of the added tragedies in transgression is that even if <i>we</i> make the effort to change, to try again, to come back, others often insist upon leaving the old labels with us.</p>
<p>I grew up in the same town with a boy who had no father and precious few of the other blessings of life. The young men in our community found it easy to tease and taunt and bully him. And in the process of it all he made some mistakes, though I cannot believe his mistakes were more serious than those of his Latter-day Saint friends who made life so miserable for him. He began to drink and smoke, and the gospel principles which had never meant much to him now meant even less. He had been cast in a role by LDS friends who should have known better and he began to play the part perfectly. Soon he drank even more, went to school even less, and went to Church not at all. Then one day he was gone. Some said that they thought he had joined the army.</p>
<p>That was about 1959 or so. Fifteen or sixteen years later he came home. At least he tried to come home. He had found the significance of the gospel in his life. He had married a wonderful girl, and they had a beautiful family. But he discovered something upon his return. He had changed, but some of his old friends hadn’t—and they were unwilling to let him escape his past.</p>
<p>This was hard for him and hard for his family. They bought a little home and started a small business, but they struggled both personally and professionally and finally moved away. For reasons that don’t need to be detailed here, the story goes on to a very unhappy ending. He died a year ago at age 44. That’s too young to die these days, and it’s certainly too young to die away from home.</p>
<p>When a battered, weary swimmer tries valiantly to get back to shore, after having fought strong winds and rough waves which he should never have challenged in the first place, those of us who might have had better judgment, or perhaps just better luck, ought not to row out to his side, beat him with our oars, and shove his head back underwater. That’s not what boats were made for. But some of us do that to each other.</p>
<p>In general conference a few years ago Elder David B. Haight told us that—</p>
<p><i>Arturo Toscanini, the late, famous conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, received a brief, crumpled letter from a lonely sheepherder in the remote mountain area of Wyoming:</i></p>
<p><i>“Mr. Conductor: I have only two possessions—a radio and an old violin. The batteries in my radio are getting low and will soon die. My violin is so out of tune I can’t use it. Please help me. Next Sunday when you begin your concert, sound a loud ‘A’ so I can tune my ‘A’ string; then I can tune the other strings. When my radio batteries are dead, I’ll have my violin.</i></p>
<p><i>At the beginning of his next nationwide radio concert from Carnegie Hall, Toscanini announced: “For a dear friend and listener back in the mountains of Wyoming the orchestra will now sound an ‘A.’” The musicians all joined together in a perfect “A.”</i></p>
<p>[That] <i>lonely sheepherder only needed one note, just a little help to get back in tune; . . . he needed someone who cared to assist him with </i>[just]<i> one string; </i>[after that]<i> the others would be easy.</i> [“People to People,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 1981, p. 54]</p>
<h2><b>William Wines Phelps’s Way Back</b></h2>
<p>In the early years of the Church the Prophet Joseph Smith had no more faithful aide than William Wines Phelps. Brother Phelps, a former newspaper editor, had joined the Church in Kirtland and was of such assistance to those early leaders that they sent him as one of the first Latter-day Saints to the New Jerusalem—Jackson County, Missouri. There he was called by the Lord to the stake presidency of that “center stake of Zion.”</p>
<p>But then troubles developed. First they were largely ecclesiastical aberrations but later there were financial improprieties. Things became so serious that the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that if Phelps did not repent, he would be “removed out of [his] place” (<i>HC</i> 2:511). He did not repent and was excommunicated on March 10, 1838.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph and others immediately tried to love Phelps back into the fold, but he would have nothing of it. Then in the fall of that violent year W. W. Phelps, along with others, signed a deadly, damaging affidavit against the Prophet and other leaders of the Church. The result was quite simply that Joseph Smith was sentenced to be publicly executed on the town square in Far West, Missouri, Friday morning, November 2, 1838. Through the monumental courage of General Alexander Doniphan, the Prophet was miraculously spared the execution Phelps and others had precipitated, but he was not spared spending five months—November through April—in several Missouri prisons, the most noted of which was the pit known ironically as Liberty Jail.</p>
<p>I do not need to recount for you the suffering of the Saints through that period. The anguish of those not captive was in many ways more severe than those imprisoned. The persecution intensified until the Saints sought yet again to find another refuge from the storm. With Joseph in chains, praying for their safety and giving some direction by letter, they made their way toward Commerce, Illinois, a malaria swamp on the Mississippi River where they would try once more to build the city of Zion. And much of this travail, this torment and heartache, was due to men of their own brotherhood like W. W. Phelps.</p>
<p>But we’re speaking today of happy endings. Two very difficult years later, with great anguish and remorse of conscience, Phelps wrote to Joseph Smith in Nauvoo.</p>
<p><i>Brother Joseph: . . . I am as the prodigal son. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have passed. . . .</i> [I] <i>ask my old brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death, yet I will die with them, for their God is my God. The least place with them is enough for me, yea, it is bigger and better than all Babylon. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me. . . . I have done wrong and I am sorry. . . . I ask forgiveness. . . . I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet.</i></p>
<p>In an instant the Prophet wrote back. I know of no private document or personal response in the life of Joseph Smith—or anyone else, for that matter—which so powerfully demonstrates the magnificence of his soul. There is a lesson here for every one of us who claims to be a disciple of Christ.</p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p><i>Dear Brother Phelps: . . . You may in some measure realize what my feelings . . . were when we read your letter . . . .</i></p>
<p><i>We have suffered much in consequence of your behavior—the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us . . . .</i></p>
<p><i>However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God’s dear children, and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and by diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our God, and your God, and to the Church of Jesus Christ.</i></p>
<p><i>Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal.</i></p>
<p><i>“Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,</i></p>
<p><i>For friends at first, are friends again at last.”</i></p>
<p><i>Yours as ever,</i></p>
<p><i>Joseph Smith, Jun.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:141–42, 162–64]</p>
<p>It only adds to the poignance of this particular prodigal’s return that exactly four years later—almost to the day—it would be W. W. Phelps selected to preach Joseph Smith’s funeral sermon in that terribly tense and emotional circumstance. Furthermore it would be W. W. Phelps who would memorialize the martyred prophet with his hymn of adoration, “Praise to the Man.”</p>
<p>Having been the foolish swimmer pulled back to safety by the very man he had sought to destroy, Phelps must have had unique appreciation for the stature of the Prophet when he penned:</p>
<p><i>Great is his glory and endless his priesthood.</i><br />
<i>Ever and ever the keys he will hold.</i><br />
<i>Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom,</i><br />
<i>Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.</i><br />
[“Praise to the Man,” <i>Hymns</i>, no. 147]</p>
<p>I requested that we sing a verse of that hymn this morning. Next time you sing it, remember what it meant to W. W. Phelps to be given another chance.</p>
<h2><b>The Prodigal Son</b></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most encouraging and compassionate parable in all of Holy Writ is the story of the prodigal son. I close with Mary Lyman Henrie’s poetic expression of it entitled “To Any Who Have Watched for a Son’s Returning.”</p>
<p><i>He watched his son gather all the goods</i><br />
<i>that were his lot,</i><br />
<i>anxious to be gone from tending flocks,</i><br />
<i>the dullness of the fields.</i></p>
<p><i>He stood by the olive tree gate long</i><br />
<i>after the caravan disappeared</i><br />
<i>where the road climbs the hills</i><br />
<i>on the far side of the valley,</i><br />
<i>into infinity.</i></p>
<p><i>Through changing seasons he spent the light</i><br />
<i>in a great chair, facing the far country,</i><br />
<i>and that speck of road on the horizon.</i></p>
<p><i>Mocking friends: “He will not come.”</i><br />
<i>Whispering servants: “The old man</i><br />
<i>has lost his senses.”</i><br />
<i>A chiding son: “You should not have let him go.”</i><br />
<i>A grieving wife: “You need rest and sleep.”</i></p>
<p><i>She covered his drooping shoulders, </i><br />
<i>his callused knees, when east winds blew chill, until that day . . . </i><br />
<i>A form familiar, even at infinity,</i><br />
<i>in shreds, alone, stumbling over pebbles.</i></p>
<p><i>“When he was a great way off,</i><br />
<i>His father saw him,</i><br />
<i>and had compassion, and ran,</i><br />
<i>and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”</i> (Luke 15:20)<br />
[<i>Ensign,</i> March 1983, p. 63]</p>
<p>God bless us to help each other come back home, where we will, in the presence of our Father, find waiting a robe, a ring, and a fatted calf, I pray in the name of Him who made it possible, even Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you in this opening session of the 2017 BYU Campus Education Week. This year’s theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 50:24, with special emphasis on these words: “And he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light.”
I am going to take a different approach to this theme than might be expected by exposing and illustrating some very cunning and effective ways that the “wicked one” prevents people from progressing and receiving more light (D&amp;C 93:39).
Many gospel principles come in pairs, meaning one is incomplete without the other. I want to refer to three of these doctrinal pairs today:

Agency and responsibility
Mercy and justice
Faith and works

When Satan is successful in dividing doctrinal pairs, he begins to wreak havoc upon mankind. It is one of his most cunning strategies to keep people from growing in the light.
You already know that faith without works really isn’t faith (see James 2:17). My primary focus will be on the other two doctrinal pairs: first, to illustrate how avoiding responsibility affects agency; and second, how “denying justice,” as it is referred to in the Book of Mormon (see Alma 42:30), affects mercy.
The Book of Mormon teaches us that we are agents to “act . . . and not to be acted upon” (2 Nephi 2:26)—or to be “free to act for [our]selves” (2 Nephi 10:23). This freedom of choice was not a gift of partial agency but of complete and total 100 percent agency. It was absolute in the sense that the One Perfect Parent never forces His children. He shows us the way and may even command us, but, “nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee” (Moses 3:17).
Assuming responsibility and being accountable for our choices are agency’s complementary principles (see D&amp;C 101:78). Responsibility is to recognize ourselves as being the cause for the effects or results of our choices—good or bad. On the negative side, it is to always own up to the consequences of poor choices.
Except for those held innocent, such as little children and the intellectually disabled, gospel doctrine teaches us that each person is responsible for the use of their agency and “will be punished for their own sins” (Articles of Faith 1:2).1 It isn’t just a heavenly principle but a law of nature—we reap what we sow.
Logically then, complete and total agency comes with complete and total responsibility:
 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it u</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I must say I never imagined myself at this podium. But I have imagined myself on this playing floor—and imagined is the right word. I’ve wondered what it would have been like to be Danny Ainge, who, during my freshman year at BYU, went coast-to-coast in the closing seconds of a Sweet Sixteen game against Notre Dame and scored over Orlando Woolridge. I’ve dreamed what it would be like to drain a three from just inside half-court, like Jimmer Fredette did against Utah. Unfortunately, my actual skill set wasn’t a match for such imagined heroics. I’m quite sure it’s not a match for this podium either. Still, I consider it a great honor to have this opportunity to speak to you this morning.
I love this university. I love the cool, crisp air of a late fall football game and the soft, golden light that falls on Y Mountain and Rock Canyon just before sunset. I even love wandering the stacks in the Harold B. Lee Library. BYU has had a great impact on my life.
My first experiences at BYU were in the late 1960s. Each summer my mother, my brother, and I came to BYU from our home in Pebble Beach, California, for spring or summer term so that my mom could work on completing her degree. We lived in Heritage Halls, or, to be more precise, we lived in what is now called “Classic Heritage” when it was almost new Heritage.
My mother ended up completing her English degree, and our home was forever enriched by what she learned at BYU. I mention my mom’s education at BYU partly because important parts of my thinking on today’s topic are derived from her thinking and writing on this topic.1
The Doctrine of Forgiveness
The title of my remarks is “Faith to Forgive Grievous Harms: Accepting the Atonement as Restitution.” Now, to some, any talk from a lawyer that focuses on forgiveness may seem odd. Don’t lawyers depend upon a lack of forgiveness to function? In lawyerspeak, is a talk on the necessity of forgiveness an admission against interest?
I am convinced that practicing law with civility and integrity is a noble endeavor and fully compatible with a forgiving heart, and I’ll have a bit more to say about this later. Indeed, before you become too critical of lawyers, listen to the words of my good friend Jim Gordon: “It is true that some lawyers are dishonest, arrogant, greedy, venal, amoral, ruthless buckets of toxic slime. On the other hand, it is unfair to judge the entire profession by a few hundred thousand bad apples.”2 Such quips can be a bit tough for those of us who are attorneys, but how much worse can it get, given the number of us whose parents, when we decided to go to law school, made sure to scrape off their car the “Ask me about my children” bumper sticker?3
Turning to the concept of forgiveness, let me start with a familiar scripture. Matthew 18:21–22 reads:

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The New Testament writer Luke described1 a fascinating scene from the Savior’s life in which Jesus, sitting at meat in the house of Simon the Pharisee, was approached by a woman who was widely known to have been a sinner. Her behavior, as she approached the Savior, revealed that she must have had some previous interaction with Him of a very personal and life-changing nature, for she tearfully knelt and kissed his feet, literally bathing his feet with her humble tears before wiping them dry with her tresses and applying precious ointment “as a [servant] might do to his master.”2
Simon, aware of the woman’s past indiscretions, inwardly reproved Jesus for allowing a sinner to approach Him in such a manner. Discerning this unrighteous judgment on the part of Simon, Christ artfully rebuked him, and then, speaking to the woman, He said something truly wondrous: “Thy sins are forgiven.” Indeed, a miracle had occurred! A miracle more powerful and momentous than the changing of water into wine or the healing of a leper—a miracle tantamount to the raising of one from the grave, for verily a precious daughter of our Heavenly Father had, in very fact, been born again and saved from spiritual death.
On hearing this account, one cannot help but ask, as did the Book of Mormon writer Enos when he heard a similar declaration of forgiveness following a long and tearful night of anguished soul-searching and prayerful pleading: “How is it done?”3 Today I would like to speak to you of what Spencer W. Kimball called “the miracle of forgiveness.”4
Two weeks ago I was released as bishop after six years of service, having also served as bishop previously in another ward and as a student branch president prior to that. One of the most marvelous things about serving as a bishop or branch president is sitting in private council with individual members of your congregation and discussing their concerns relating to their personal worthiness and their standing before God; for it is during these sacred times that a bishop receives a large measure of the inspiration and understanding that will come to him by virtue of his calling as a judge in Israel. And I can attest that at such times I have been given to understand more fully the role of the Savior and His Atonement in our Heavenly Father’s plan and the truly miraculous nature of forgiveness.
To fully understand this miracle, we must contemplate the grand and glorious plan of salvation authored by our Father in Heaven. Before we came to this earth we lived as spirits5 with our heavenly parents and siblings, including our Elder Brother Jesus Christ. In that premortal realm a grand council6 was called, and we were presented with our Heavenly Father’s plan, which allowed our further progression. We do not know all the details of that council, but from the scriptures and the writings of latter-day prophets</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When couples get married, their love is deep, and they joyfully anticipate the prospect of spending the eternities together. They enjoy having endless talks, going for long walks, and spending time together. It is a wonderful feeling being with someone you love so deeply.
Unfortunately, for many couples the bliss of deep love and immensely satisfying companionship that was present when they first got married doesn’t last. Long talks become replaced with frequent arguments, and when not spent fighting, their time together is characterized by angry silence.
Many of these couples divorce. Others manage the hostility by emotionally withdrawing from the relationship. The spouses become distant from each other, and they keep their interaction to a minimum. President Spencer W. Kimball described these couples when he said:
There are many people who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end their marriages, but who have permitted their marriage to grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouses who . . . are in the low state of mere joint occupancy of the home. [In Marriage (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 44–46; adapted from Kimball, “Marriage and Divorce,” BYU devotional address, 7 September 1976]
How do these couples go from ecstatic levels of love and happiness to frequent conflict, bitterness, and, in many cases, eventual divorce?
A number of reasons have been identified by researchers, but lately I’ve been thinking that most of these reasons can be boiled down to two fundamental factors: a lack of repentance and a lack of forgiveness.
It is important to note that these principles of repentance and forgiveness apply to all relationships, not just to marriage. They apply to roommates, family members, and colleagues at work. So, no matter what one’s marital status is or what the prospects in the near future are, these principles are important to all of us.
In most cases we are married for only a short time before we hurt our spouse’s feelings. Whether it is intentional, based on selfishness, or just inadvertent mistakes, we all end up doing things that create hurt in our spouse.
The remedy is pretty straightforward. We say, “I’m sorry.” We feel badly that we hurt our spouse, apologize, learn from the experience, and do our best not to make the same mistake again. We repent, and, assuming that the problem wasn’t too major, the issue is over.
Elder Joe J. Christensen said:
To develop a solid marriage, we must be able to admit we are sorry for the mistakes we make. . . . When conflicts in marriage arise, we should be swift to apologize and ask for forgiveness, even though we may not be totally at fault. True love is developed by those who are willing to readily admit personal mistakes and offenses. [One Step a</span>
