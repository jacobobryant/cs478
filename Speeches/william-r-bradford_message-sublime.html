  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I deliver to you a message that I know to be true. There will be no speculation in my words. It is the greatest message that can be known either in the heavens or upon the earth. It has cost the lives of millions to preserve and bring forth.

Through the ages a most formidable effort has been and continues to be expended to prevent this message from being transmitted, by either the spoken or the written word. Any and every method, regardless of how mean or cruel or destructive, is being used to seal the lips of the messenger, to plug the ears of the listener, and to blind the eyes of the reader that this, the most sublime of all messages, may not be delivered.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Message&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I will speak with the authority of a messenger sent by Him whose message it is. The message is, there is a God in heaven. Oh, rejoice all who inhabit the earth, for as assuredly as we live there is a God. God is a being. He is a person. He has a body of flesh and bone. It is tangible. He lives and moves and has emotions and passions. This God is infinite and eternal. He is unchangeable and is from everlasting to everlasting.

I rejoice to know and I declare to you that this God is my Father. I am His son. I was begotten after His image. By His seed was I conceived, and I am of His species. Could there be any other knowledge so blissful? Is there any truth that can be perceived by man that is of such all-encompassing magnificence?

I am His son. He is my Father. It is a Father-son, Parent-child relationship. He loves me. Oh, how He loves me! As I come to know Him, I love Him.

God, who is my Father, has a dwelling place. It is named heaven. God is my Father in Heaven. God is the framer of the heaven. He used laws to organize intelligence, light, and truth into a supernal habitat where His children may dwell with Him if they will obey the conditions of the law by which heaven is organized.

God organized heaven into an environment of light as opposed to darkness—of life as opposed to death—of joy as opposed to sorrow—of harmony and order as opposed to confusion and disorder—of grace as opposed to disgrace. All goodness and exactness, all truth and virtue, are incorporated into that environment.

God outlined the boundaries of this heaven and established it as His kingdom. He set forth its limits and conditions as decreed by law. He named it celestial, the celestial kingdom, the place where God, my Heavenly Father, dwells.

Knowing this, is it unusual or cause for wonderment that I would raise my voice toward the heaven and rejoice and say, “My Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,” or “Oh, God my Eternal Father”?

God “created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them” (D&amp;amp;C 20:18).

If you have eyes to see and mind to perceive, if you have emotions and passions with which to feel, if you have hands to touch and ears to hear, if you have consciousness of man with all or any of these senses, then you know the true nature of God.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Are God’s Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
God created man after his own image and in His own likeness, male and female, created He them.

I repeat, it is a Father-son, Parent-child relationship. He loves us. He created a home for us, a heavenly home. He wants us to live in that celestial home. He wants us to be as He is. He wants us to live the glorious style of life He lives. In order for us to be as He is and live the style of life He lives, we must be obedient to the same conditions of law to which He is obedient.

God knows this, and He has taken upon Himself a work to provide a sequence of training and experience that will teach and perfect His children that they may, if they will, come to obedience to the conditions of the laws of God.

In order for this to happen, it was necessary for God’s children to leave His presence. They would need to go to a place where they could work with the laws of God until they came into full harmony with and obedience to them.

God brought about the creation of the earth and all things that are in it. The earth is known to us. We know its environment. We can touch and smell and see and feel it. We know its systems and seasons, its givings and its exactings.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Plan Was Instituted&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
God gave His children commandments with a promise that if they would obey the commandments, the experiences they would have on earth would perfect them and bring them into full harmony with the conditions of His law and that they would then be qualified to return to dwell with Him and live the style of life He lives.

The commandments that God gave His children are very simple: “that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship” (D&amp;amp;C 20:19).

There was to be no force. All God’s children were to have free agency, the authority to choose for themselves. They could obey the commandments and gain the blessed results, or they could disobey. God taught His children that if they disobeyed, they could not return. He explained to His children that while they were upon the earth, He could not leave them alone. He would send His teachings, His word, by way of messengers, and by His Spirit, and by the communication of prayer. There would be prophets to whom He would reveal His will for His children’s progress. There would be examples, all of which they could take full advantage of, but nevertheless they must choose for themselves and act according to their choices. They were also taught the consequences of disobedience.

All of this was organized into a plan, a plan for the salvation and exaltation of God’s children. The plan was carefully and precisely taught to us. All the consequences of the plan were considered and provisions made for them. Administrators of the plan were chosen.

Let me use God’s own words as He tells us of this process. He said one of His sons, whose name was Lucifer,

&lt;i&gt;came before me saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 4:1, 3, 4]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Doctrine of Fallen Man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
God placed His children upon the earth, male and female, and gave them physical bodies to house their spirit bodies, but they listened to Satan and transgressed the holy laws of God. “By the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man” (D&amp;amp;C 20:20).

&lt;i&gt;Fallen man&lt;/i&gt; simply means that death came upon us. There are two kinds of death. One kind is known about by all of us. It is that our physical bodies die. No one ever escapes this death. There is nothing that can be done to avoid it. It overcomes us in an hour that we know not.

We all love life. We cling to it. We endure pain and sorrow in the process, but we are willing to endure almost anything if it will sustain life. We fear death only because death is clouded by the unknown.

This death of the physical body separates us from those with whom we have lived in mortality. Our spirit body lives on, but the spirit body of fallen man cannot return to that glorious dwelling place of God.

Just as our physical body is separated from our home and loved ones at its death, so then must our spirit body be separated from our heavenly home and environment forever, to live the conditions of darkness and sorrow forever, and this because of disobedience to God’s commandments which made us fallen man.

Oh, what agony! Oh, what unquenchable grief! Oh, what a pitiful circumstance to be doomed to an everlasting misery, separated from both physical body and the presence of God.

Oh, fallen man, from whence is thy recovery? From what source thy redemption?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Savior Was Provided&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
“Wherefore, the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son” (D&amp;amp;C 20:21).

He said, “But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me—Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever” (Moses 4:2).

This Only Begotten Son’s name is Jesus Christ. He came to the earth and did a work which was sufficient to overcome both physical death, which is the separation of the physical body from the spirit body, and spiritual death, which is separation of the spirit body from God.

&lt;i&gt;He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He was crucified, died, and rose again the third day.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 20:22–23]

And since his children had fallen, the Almighty God saw their awful carnal state and enacted

&lt;i&gt;the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance . . . and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory&lt;/i&gt;. [Alma 22:13–14]

After Christ had completed this work, He

&lt;i&gt;ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end, should be saved&lt;/i&gt;. [D&amp;amp;C 20:24–25]

&lt;i&gt;And we know that all men &lt;/i&gt;must&lt;i&gt; repent and believe on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God&lt;/i&gt;. [D&amp;amp;C 20:29; emphasis added]

This is the most transcendent and magnificent of all things that man can know.

“Death is conquered, man is free. / Christ has won the victory” (Cecil Alexander, “He Is Risen,” &lt;i&gt;Hymns&lt;/i&gt;, No. 61).

I solemnly testify that I speak of what I know. That which I have said is true.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Witness of the Book of Mormon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There may be those who say to themselves, “How do you know it is true?” To you I say: I hold in my hand the Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ. This book has cost the lives of millions to preserve and bring forth. The Almighty God has stretched forth his arm and has let fall the sword in behalf of the preservation of this book. The book contains two things that make it absolutely vital to us. The first is that it contains a record of a fallen people.

Why is it so vital that we have a record of a fallen people? Why would such a record merit the trial and suffering of those who have sacrificed to bring forth this book, even to the constant and direct intervention of God Almighty?

I submit to you that no one, regardless of race or creed, can ever understand the role of and the need for a savior and a redeemer unless he first knows from what he needs to be saved or redeemed. No person, regardless of his religion or tradition, can understand victory over death and the terms upon which his salvation depends unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man.

Satan from the beginning, when Adam and Eve were first placed upon the earth, has gone forth deceiving the children of our Heavenly Father.

They have been beguiled and, through the ages, but for a few, have had no understanding of the true doctrine of fallen man.

Therefore, behold this book which contains a record of fallen man,

&lt;i&gt;By these things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But by the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 20:17–20]

Fallen man is he who must forever be separated from his physical body and from the presence of God, forever dead in that there is no return to God for fallen man.

The second thing this book contains is the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That marvelous plan which God has prepared for the salvation and exaltation of His children is named the gospel of Jesus Christ. It outlines in every detail what men may do, &lt;i&gt;if they will&lt;/i&gt;, to return to God our Father to dwell where He dwells and live the style of life He lives. It outlines to the mind of men who Christ really is. It places Him in His supreme role as Savior and Redeemer and the Almighty who rules and reigns over this earth.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Witness of the Holy Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
“How do you know it is true?” you may ask.

When Christ ascended to heaven to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father, He did not leave us alone. He sent the Holy Ghost to the earth, the Holy Ghost, the third member of the holy trinity, a member of the presiding Godhead. This Holy Ghost is the Comforter. He witnesses to God’s children that the message I have just presented is true.

By these things I know that it is true: By the doctrine of fallen man, by the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as contained in the Book of Mormon, and by the witness of the Holy Ghost who has come to me and has overcome my soul so that I know it is true.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Undeniable Witness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The most transcendent and magnificent message in the heavens and in the earth is that there is a God in heaven, that He is our Father, and that we are His children. Oh, that the world knew that message!

Those who know this marvelous truth have the privilege and responsibility to declare it throughout the world. Upon our ability to bring God’s children to this knowledge and understanding rests the success of our labors.

I repeat, no man can know and understand the need for a savior unless he understands first what it is that he must be saved from. And no man can understand what he must be saved from unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man. And no man can understand the doctrine of fallen man unless he understands that God is our Father and that He gave us commandments and that because of transgression and disobedience to these commandments, man became sensual and devilish and &lt;i&gt;fallen man&lt;/i&gt;.

This Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. No man can be exalted in the celestial kingdom unless he knows and lives the doctrine contained in this book. This book comes with a sacred promise. If you will read it and then lift up your voice to God in prayer, if you will ask, “God, are you there? Are you my Father? Is this true?” He will send the Holy Ghost, who will overcome your soul, and you will know that it is true. This happens in that same indescribable way by which you know that you love someone or that someone loves you.

Again I declare unto you with the undeniable witness of the Holy Ghost that this message is true and that the book is true. May God grant that you become a partaker of these glorious gifts of exaltation. God lives. He is there in His heaven. He loves us and awaits our return. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I deliver to you a message that I know to be true. There will be no speculation in my words. It is the greatest message that can be known either in the heavens or upon the earth. It has cost the lives of millions to preserve and bring forth.</p>
<p>Through the ages a most formidable effort has been and continues to be expended to prevent this message from being transmitted, by either the spoken or the written word. Any and every method, regardless of how mean or cruel or destructive, is being used to seal the lips of the messenger, to plug the ears of the listener, and to blind the eyes of the reader that this, the most sublime of all messages, may not be delivered.</p>
<h2><b>The Message</b></h2>
<p>I will speak with the authority of a messenger sent by Him whose message it is. The message is, there is a God in heaven. Oh, rejoice all who inhabit the earth, for as assuredly as we live there is a God. God is a being. He is a person. He has a body of flesh and bone. It is tangible. He lives and moves and has emotions and passions. This God is infinite and eternal. He is unchangeable and is from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
<p>I rejoice to know and I declare to you that this God is my Father. I am His son. I was begotten after His image. By His seed was I conceived, and I am of His species. Could there be any other knowledge so blissful? Is there any truth that can be perceived by man that is of such all-encompassing magnificence?</p>
<p>I am His son. He is my Father. It is a Father-son, Parent-child relationship. He loves me. Oh, how He loves me! As I come to know Him, I love Him.</p>
<p>God, who is my Father, has a dwelling place. It is named heaven. God is my Father in Heaven. God is the framer of the heaven. He used laws to organize intelligence, light, and truth into a supernal habitat where His children may dwell with Him if they will obey the conditions of the law by which heaven is organized.</p>
<p>God organized heaven into an environment of light as opposed to darkness—of life as opposed to death—of joy as opposed to sorrow—of harmony and order as opposed to confusion and disorder—of grace as opposed to disgrace. All goodness and exactness, all truth and virtue, are incorporated into that environment.</p>
<p>God outlined the boundaries of this heaven and established it as His kingdom. He set forth its limits and conditions as decreed by law. He named it celestial, the celestial kingdom, the place where God, my Heavenly Father, dwells.</p>
<p>Knowing this, is it unusual or cause for wonderment that I would raise my voice toward the heaven and rejoice and say, “My Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,” or “Oh, God my Eternal Father”?</p>
<p>God “created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them” (D&amp;C 20:18).</p>
<p>If you have eyes to see and mind to perceive, if you have emotions and passions with which to feel, if you have hands to touch and ears to hear, if you have consciousness of man with all or any of these senses, then you know the true nature of God.</p>
<h2><b>We Are God’s Children</b></h2>
<p>God created man after his own image and in His own likeness, male and female, created He them.</p>
<p>I repeat, it is a Father-son, Parent-child relationship. He loves us. He created a home for us, a heavenly home. He wants us to live in that celestial home. He wants us to be as He is. He wants us to live the glorious style of life He lives. In order for us to be as He is and live the style of life He lives, we must be obedient to the same conditions of law to which He is obedient.</p>
<p>God knows this, and He has taken upon Himself a work to provide a sequence of training and experience that will teach and perfect His children that they may, if they will, come to obedience to the conditions of the laws of God.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, it was necessary for God’s children to leave His presence. They would need to go to a place where they could work with the laws of God until they came into full harmony with and obedience to them.</p>
<p>God brought about the creation of the earth and all things that are in it. The earth is known to us. We know its environment. We can touch and smell and see and feel it. We know its systems and seasons, its givings and its exactings.</p>
<h2><b>The Plan Was Instituted</b></h2>
<p>God gave His children commandments with a promise that if they would obey the commandments, the experiences they would have on earth would perfect them and bring them into full harmony with the conditions of His law and that they would then be qualified to return to dwell with Him and live the style of life He lives.</p>
<p>The commandments that God gave His children are very simple: “that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship” (D&amp;C 20:19).</p>
<p>There was to be no force. All God’s children were to have free agency, the authority to choose for themselves. They could obey the commandments and gain the blessed results, or they could disobey. God taught His children that if they disobeyed, they could not return. He explained to His children that while they were upon the earth, He could not leave them alone. He would send His teachings, His word, by way of messengers, and by His Spirit, and by the communication of prayer. There would be prophets to whom He would reveal His will for His children’s progress. There would be examples, all of which they could take full advantage of, but nevertheless they must choose for themselves and act according to their choices. They were also taught the consequences of disobedience.</p>
<p>All of this was organized into a plan, a plan for the salvation and exaltation of God’s children. The plan was carefully and precisely taught to us. All the consequences of the plan were considered and provisions made for them. Administrators of the plan were chosen.</p>
<p>Let me use God’s own words as He tells us of this process. He said one of His sons, whose name was Lucifer,</p>
<p><i>came before me saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i></p>
<p><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i> [Moses 4:1, 3, 4]</p>
<h2><b>The Doctrine of Fallen Man</b></h2>
<p>God placed His children upon the earth, male and female, and gave them physical bodies to house their spirit bodies, but they listened to Satan and transgressed the holy laws of God. “By the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man” (D&amp;C 20:20).</p>
<p><i>Fallen man</i> simply means that death came upon us. There are two kinds of death. One kind is known about by all of us. It is that our physical bodies die. No one ever escapes this death. There is nothing that can be done to avoid it. It overcomes us in an hour that we know not.</p>
<p>We all love life. We cling to it. We endure pain and sorrow in the process, but we are willing to endure almost anything if it will sustain life. We fear death only because death is clouded by the unknown.</p>
<p>This death of the physical body separates us from those with whom we have lived in mortality. Our spirit body lives on, but the spirit body of fallen man cannot return to that glorious dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>Just as our physical body is separated from our home and loved ones at its death, so then must our spirit body be separated from our heavenly home and environment forever, to live the conditions of darkness and sorrow forever, and this because of disobedience to God’s commandments which made us fallen man.</p>
<p>Oh, what agony! Oh, what unquenchable grief! Oh, what a pitiful circumstance to be doomed to an everlasting misery, separated from both physical body and the presence of God.</p>
<p>Oh, fallen man, from whence is thy recovery? From what source thy redemption?</p>
<h2><b>A Savior Was Provided</b></h2>
<p>“Wherefore, the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son” (D&amp;C 20:21).</p>
<p>He said, “But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me—Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever” (Moses 4:2).</p>
<p>This Only Begotten Son’s name is Jesus Christ. He came to the earth and did a work which was sufficient to overcome both physical death, which is the separation of the physical body from the spirit body, and spiritual death, which is separation of the spirit body from God.</p>
<p><i>He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.</i></p>
<p><i>He was crucified, died, and rose again the third day.</i> [D&amp;C 20:22–23]</p>
<p>And since his children had fallen, the Almighty God saw their awful carnal state and enacted</p>
<p><i>the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</i></p>
<p><i>And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance . . . and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory</i>. [Alma 22:13–14]</p>
<p>After Christ had completed this work, He</p>
<p><i>ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father;</i></p>
<p><i>That as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end, should be saved</i>. [D&amp;C 20:24–25]</p>
<p><i>And we know that all men </i>must<i> repent and believe on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God</i>. [D&amp;C 20:29; emphasis added]</p>
<p>This is the most transcendent and magnificent of all things that man can know.</p>
<p>“Death is conquered, man is free. / Christ has won the victory” (Cecil Alexander, “He Is Risen,” <i>Hymns</i>, No. 61).</p>
<p>I solemnly testify that I speak of what I know. That which I have said is true.</p>
<h2><b>The Witness of the Book of Mormon</b></h2>
<p>There may be those who say to themselves, “How do you know it is true?” To you I say: I hold in my hand the Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ. This book has cost the lives of millions to preserve and bring forth. The Almighty God has stretched forth his arm and has let fall the sword in behalf of the preservation of this book. The book contains two things that make it absolutely vital to us. The first is that it contains a record of a fallen people.</p>
<p>Why is it so vital that we have a record of a fallen people? Why would such a record merit the trial and suffering of those who have sacrificed to bring forth this book, even to the constant and direct intervention of God Almighty?</p>
<p>I submit to you that no one, regardless of race or creed, can ever understand the role of and the need for a savior and a redeemer unless he first knows from what he needs to be saved or redeemed. No person, regardless of his religion or tradition, can understand victory over death and the terms upon which his salvation depends unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man.</p>
<p>Satan from the beginning, when Adam and Eve were first placed upon the earth, has gone forth deceiving the children of our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>They have been beguiled and, through the ages, but for a few, have had no understanding of the true doctrine of fallen man.</p>
<p>Therefore, behold this book which contains a record of fallen man,</p>
<p><i>By these things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;</i></p>
<p><i>And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them;</i></p>
<p><i>And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.</i></p>
<p><i>But by the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man.</i> [D&amp;C 20:17–20]</p>
<p>Fallen man is he who must forever be separated from his physical body and from the presence of God, forever dead in that there is no return to God for fallen man.</p>
<p>The second thing this book contains is the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That marvelous plan which God has prepared for the salvation and exaltation of His children is named the gospel of Jesus Christ. It outlines in every detail what men may do, <i>if they will</i>, to return to God our Father to dwell where He dwells and live the style of life He lives. It outlines to the mind of men who Christ really is. It places Him in His supreme role as Savior and Redeemer and the Almighty who rules and reigns over this earth.</p>
<h2><b>The Witness of the Holy Spirit</b></h2>
<p>“How do you know it is true?” you may ask.</p>
<p>When Christ ascended to heaven to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father, He did not leave us alone. He sent the Holy Ghost to the earth, the Holy Ghost, the third member of the holy trinity, a member of the presiding Godhead. This Holy Ghost is the Comforter. He witnesses to God’s children that the message I have just presented is true.</p>
<p>By these things I know that it is true: By the doctrine of fallen man, by the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as contained in the Book of Mormon, and by the witness of the Holy Ghost who has come to me and has overcome my soul so that I know it is true.</p>
<h2><b>The Undeniable Witness</b></h2>
<p>The most transcendent and magnificent message in the heavens and in the earth is that there is a God in heaven, that He is our Father, and that we are His children. Oh, that the world knew that message!</p>
<p>Those who know this marvelous truth have the privilege and responsibility to declare it throughout the world. Upon our ability to bring God’s children to this knowledge and understanding rests the success of our labors.</p>
<p>I repeat, no man can know and understand the need for a savior unless he understands first what it is that he must be saved from. And no man can understand what he must be saved from unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man. And no man can understand the doctrine of fallen man unless he understands that God is our Father and that He gave us commandments and that because of transgression and disobedience to these commandments, man became sensual and devilish and <i>fallen man</i>.</p>
<p>This Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. No man can be exalted in the celestial kingdom unless he knows and lives the doctrine contained in this book. This book comes with a sacred promise. If you will read it and then lift up your voice to God in prayer, if you will ask, “God, are you there? Are you my Father? Is this true?” He will send the Holy Ghost, who will overcome your soul, and you will know that it is true. This happens in that same indescribable way by which you know that you love someone or that someone loves you.</p>
<p>Again I declare unto you with the undeniable witness of the Holy Ghost that this message is true and that the book is true. May God grant that you become a partaker of these glorious gifts of exaltation. God lives. He is there in His heaven. He loves us and awaits our return. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In preparing my remarks for today, I could not help remembering a recent experience of mine.
Some months ago, I enjoyed the privilege of presiding at a stake conference alongside Elder Donald J. Keyes, one of our noble Area Seventies. During the course of the Saturday evening session—often one of the highlights of a stake conference—we were required to adjust our program at short notice because of the inclusion of some additional speakers. In view of the fact that a duet, sung by a young couple, was to be moved in the program to follow Elder Keyes’s remarks and precede mine, I accordingly quietly whispered the proposed change in the program to him.
After doing so, it was quickly apparent that he had not fully grasped what I had just said, which required me to repeat my message a second time. Unfortunately, this time, and to my dismay, his lack of understanding was now amplified by a look of incredulity and utter disbelief. Realizing now that I had somehow failed in my attempt to clearly convey the change in our program, I repeated my message in a manner that could not be mistaken: I said, and this time more clearly and slowly than I had done previously, but with some added emphasis, “Don, the duet will be sung between you and me!”
This time my message hit the mark, for now his incredulity and disbelief were replaced by a nervous giggle and a hint of terror.
I then reviewed carefully in my mind what I had just said and at last realized my terrible error: When I had said, “The duet will be sung between us,” he had taken my words literally. In other words, he had understood that the duet would be sung by the two of us!
I am pleased to reassure all of you here today that neither I, nor President Samuelson, have any intention of singing any duet, anywhere, at anytime, to anyone!
My beloved brothers and sisters, it is truly a rare privilege to be in your presence today. As I speak, our children and their families are viewing this broadcast in our home, back in South Africa, where it is just after eight o’ clock in the evening. Just think about the power of modern technology! One day, when I am released from this calling, Diane and I expect to sit alongside our children in our home in Featherbrooke, South Africa, and continue to enjoy the blessings of these great gatherings via satellite broadcast.
I am pleased to convey the love and greetings of the First Presidency to you. Alongside your parents and loved ones, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as stewards of the keys of the kingdom of God, have a deep interest in you and an abiding faith in your progress and development.
When one considers the glorious work of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, nothing surpasses in importance and power the restoration of a true knowledge and understanding of God the Eternal Father and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. In the world in which we</span>

He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son, Jesus Christ. Like Alma, “I testify unto you that I do know that these things . . . are true. . . . They are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God” (Alma 5:45–46). I know these things because of my own journey. And if Heavenly Father loves me and knows of me—since He is no respecter of persons—He loves you as well.
My purpose today is to share with you five facets of my testimony that show God loves us. These are simple and quite personal. I pray that your testimony of God’s love for you will grow as you think of your own experiences and that together we may receive the “word of truth” through the Holy Ghost (D&amp;C 50:17). I hope that as I speak, you will contemplate the many ways that God loves you. As I conclude today, I will ask you a question: “So what are you going to do?”
First: I testify that God loves us because He grants unto us the revelator known as the Holy Ghost.
It was October of 1972, a clear and sunny Sunday. I was a freshman at BYU. I rode my bicycle up Provo Canyon to Upper Falls. There I contemplated what in the world I was doing here. You see, I came to BYU as a nonmember. Why? Well, several friends at high school were going to BYU, and they simply invited me along. I applied to BYU, and when my parents and I visited campus, coming from smoggy and dry Southern California, we were sold. I knew very little about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints except that they didn’t smoke or drink.
I had arrived on campus a week or so early to attend a late summer honors program. There I met my first roommate, Rahn Price. After a long day we were ready to go to sleep in our room in Deseret Towers (may they rest in peace). Then something unusual happened. Rahn rolled out of bed, knelt at his bedside, and prayed silently. I didn’t know what to do. I was quite astonished. I finally said my own prayer:
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;
Should I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.
I was done well before he was. Much later, Rahn said that was the most awkward prayer he had ever said. However, I’m grateful that he did say that prayer.
As the semester began, I learned about agency from a Book of Mormon teacher named Bruce Hafen. I learned of the Atonement. Although I had grown up in a Christian church and was raised by “goodly parents” (1 Nephi 1:1), these concepts were certainly deeper than the wading pool of doctrine I had grown up with.
Once the semester began, my friends in Helaman Halls invited me to church, but I respectfully declined. They did not pester me or make me feel out of place. On Sundays I would just do my ow</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Several years ago, during a challenging and hectic period in my life, I read a statement by President Brigham Young that has meant a great deal to me ever since. He said:
When you . . . see our Father, you will see a being with whom you have long been acquainted, and He will receive you into His arms, and you will be ready to fall into His embrace and kiss Him. . . . You will be so glad and joyful. . . . When you are qualified and purified, . . . you can endure the glory of eternity. [JD 4:54–55]
How blessed we are to know what President Young taught us about our Heavenly Father—what kind of a being He is, what He is really like. How many people over the space of thousands of years have not even known that there is a Father in Heaven? How many individuals’ lives might have been different if they could only have known about our loving, merciful, and caring Heavenly Father? Indeed, how blessed we are to have such teachings that center on the nature of our Father in Heaven. It is about God, our Eternal Father, that I wish to speak today.
The first article or principle in our declaration of faith as Latter-day Saints states, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father” (Articles of Faith 1:1). I do not think it is accidental or coincidental that this statement comes first in our 13 Articles of Faith.
The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God” (Teachings, 345). In other words, one of the foundation stones of the restored gospel is a knowledge of what kind of being God actually is. But not only do we need to understand what kind of being God is, we must come to know God. In the same sermon from which we just quoted, the Prophet Joseph further stated, “If any man does not know God, . . . he will realize that he has not eternal life; for there can be eternal life on no other principle” (Teachings, 344). In His great high-priestly or Intercessory Prayer, the Savior confirmed that life eternal was to “know . . . the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [the Father] hast sent” (John 17:3).
Thus everything of sacred significance connected with our future rests on both our coming to know about God the Eternal Father and, ultimately, our coming to know Him. “If men do not comprehend the character of God,” said Joseph Smith, “they do not comprehend themselves” (Teachings, 343). God and men are of the same divine, eternal species, and if we do not comprehend the nature of God, we cannot appreciate our divine parentage nor the very real potential we possess to become like our heavenly parents.
God Must Be Revealed
Coming to know God is not for the spiritually lazy. He can only be known through revelation. And powerful personal revelation, as many of you know, is predicated upon righteous living and spiritual discipline. Elder Bruce R. McConki</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to David Whitmer, we are told that eternal life “is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (D&amp;C 14:7). When we understand that the entire work and glory of the Savior is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39), a most significant question for us is “How do we obtain eternal life?” The Savior provided the key in His great intercessory prayer recorded by John, the beloved apostle: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3). The key, then, to eternal life is to know God the Father and Jesus Christ.
Here at BYU, as at any university, we are engaged in the business of knowing. Our knowledge is tested in exams, papers, laboratories, and applied settings. If you are like me, some of those things we know just long enough to take a test for, and there are other things we know and retain long past any examination.
I believe that the “knowing” spoken of by the Savior is far above a knowing of facts, techniques, or theories. To know Jesus Christ requires a different kind of knowledge. To gain eternal life we cannot merely be acquainted with Him or recall some factoid about His life as if we were playing a trivia game. We cannot simply read about Him. Knowing Him is more than knowing His doctrine and certainly more than professing His doctrine. The New Testament tells of many who spent time with Jesus, who heard His words and even saw His miracles, but who, sadly, never knew Him. Knowing Him in the way that He has counseled and pled with us to know Him requires everything we are and, in the end, changes our beings forever.
Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone described the transforming power of knowing Him in this way:
One who truly knows Him does not—nor cannot, nor will not—forget Him, ever. Whatever daily task, pleasure, sport, or activity we may be involved in, His desires are supreme in our lives. If we become careless in the way we wear the garment, haphazardly use the Lord&#8217;s name, or serve only socially in the Church, we clearly do not “know” the Master. We might even know the Church is true, but actually knowing Jesus Christ would dramatically change our conduct. We would no longer have a disposition to do evil; rather, we would feel absolutely submissive to His will and turn our lives over to Him. Knowing Him is much, much more than knowing about Him. [Vaughn J. Featherstone, The Incomparable Christ: Our Master and Model (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1995), 26]
We gain understanding of the power of knowing Him when we reflect on His visit to the American continent. What happened changed the way those people “knew” the Savior. His words had been available to them for their entire lifetimes. Believers among them had taught of Him and prophesied of Him. But when the people really “knew Him,” their </span>
