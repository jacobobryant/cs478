  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="The history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a "marvelous work and a wonder," an unfolding story of revelation, sacrifice, and faith. As a Church historian, I am continually amazed at why it is that some toss and tangle with our past to discredit their faith and that of those around them while others find solace, cheer, and comfort from our past. I am of the latter persuasion and have chosen to see the hand of the Lord not only in our history but also in the discovery of new understandings of His handiwork in the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days. If my bias is showing, it is only because of my firm testimony that in all its ups and downs, comings and goings, this is the Lords doing and His hand figures carefully, if not always prominently, in this great work. And as for Church history, we learn patiently "line upon line," or, as the scripture says: "But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it" (Romans 8:25). I wish to discuss one example of this today.

My purpose is to share with you new light on a very important episode in our history. In 1970 the late Stanley B. Kimball published an article in &lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt; in which he examined the significance of the so-called "Anthon Transcript," the identity of the leading scholars who Martin Harris consulted in February 1828, and why Harris returned so committed to financing the printing of the Book of Mormon.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; My specific purpose in delivering this much abridged version of a longer study I have recently published is to reveal the identity of the three "wise men" Harris visited - Luther Bradish, Charles Anthon, and Samuel L. Mitchill - and what in their background, training, and personalities uniquely prepared them for Harriss visit and why Harris left New York so resolved to pay for the Book of Mormons printing.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The outlines of this story are well known. In late 1827, working with the gold plates and the Urim and Thummim, Joseph Smith began translating the "reformed Egyptian" characters found in the book of Lehi on the large plates of Nephi. As part of this early work, he transcribed some of the characters as a sort of alphabet or reference guide. His primary scribe was then Martin Harris - a well-known and respected Palmyra farmer, an early and keen supporter of Joseph Smiths work, and later one of the Three Witnesses. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the resentment of his wife, Lucy, at his growing involvement, Harris persuaded Joseph to let him take a transcription to New York City, as historian B. H. Roberts wrote, "to submit them to men of learning for their inspection."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Roberts says Harris submitted "two papers containing different transcripts, to Professors Anthon and Mitchell [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;], of New York, one that was translated and one not translated."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

According to Anthons own accounts, Harris first visited Mitchill, who wrote him a letter referring him to Anthon,&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; who in turn "stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian" and that the characters "were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyric, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters . . . and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; However, when Harris said that an angel had given Joseph the book, Anthon tore up his certificate, vehemently denied the possibility of heavenly manifestations, and told Harris to bring him the plates, which he would translate. When Harris replied he could not do so and that parts of the plates were sealed, Anthon brusquely responded, "I cannot read a sealed book."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Harris promptly returned to Mitchill, "who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Sometime later this entire episode came to be interpreted as fulfilling Isaiah 29:11, which speaks of "the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Whatever else Harris gleaned from these leading scholars, they confirmed his beliefs and encouraged him to devote his time, energy, and resources to the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon. If he left Palmyra wondering and inquiring, Harris returned supporting and defending.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luther Bradish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
William W. Phelps recalled that Harris went to New York City by way of Albany, the state capital.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Pomeroy Tucker mentioned that "he sought . . . the interpretation and bibliological scrutiny of such scholars as Hon. Luther Bradish, Dr. Mitchell, Professor Anthon, and others."&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Why was Harris interested in this man Bradish?

In 1828 Luther Bradish (17881863) was a newly elected member of the New York State Assembly who would later run for governor. Born and raised in Massachusetts, Bradish had lived for a considerable period of time in Palmyra, where his parents had moved in 1798. Bradish remained in Massachusetts to attend Williams College, graduating with a BA in 1804. After graduation he rejoined his parents in Palmyra before accepting a teaching post in 1806 at Union Hall Academy in Jamaica, Long Island. By 1810 Bradish had opted for a law career, and he became a very successful, relatively wealthy lawyer whose clients included such well-known literary figures as Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper. On several occasions, certainly in 1815 and again in 1819, he had made extensive visits to Palmyra.

Thus Martin Harris was calling on a man with whom he was already well acquainted. The Harris and Bradish families had both come to Palmyra in the 1790s. In 1804 both Martins and Luther Bradishs fathers were together elected as overseers of roads. By 1811 Martin Harris and Calvin Bradish, Luthers older brother, had replaced their fathers as overseers and worked together for a year.

In April 1816 Bradishs wife, Helen, died in giving birth to their son, who also perished. Bradish sought consolation or at least distraction by traveling abroad. A Whig like John Quincy Adams (then secretary of state and later U.S. president), Bradish applied for a special passport in 1820 offering to serve his country if it cared to take advantage of his whereabouts.

Adams was particularly interested in promoting American commercial interests with the Ottoman Empire at a time when acute tensions were developing between Turkey and the Muslim countries on the one side and Greece, Russia, and Great Britain on the other. England was especially wary about American interference in this volatile Mediterranean region. Thus Bradish went to Turkey as a private citizen but in a secret, quasi-official capacity. His assigned objectives were to discover whether American interests could be furthered by a treaty of amity and commerce with the Ottoman Empire; to determine the best way of accomplishing this objective; and, finally, to obtain free passage for American ships to Russian ports on the Black Sea. Secretly transported by American naval ships, young Bradish traveled to Constantinople, capital of the Ottoman Empire, which then held loose control over Egypt, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. With a special passport from the sultans government, Bradish secretly embarked for Egypt in February 1821. He stayed there for five months and held several meetings with the Egyptian ruler Mohammed Ali Pasha.

His visit to Egypt coincided with the "war of the consuls" between England and France over the archaeological spoils of Egypt, then being plundered by European excavators. Since Napoleons invasion of Egypt in 1798, an intense European interest in Egyptian antiquities had developed, highlighted by the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 and its eventual decipherment in 1822 by the brilliant French linguist Jean-Franois Champollion. Interest in all things Egyptian was at a fever pitch when Bradish, the only known American in Egypt at the time, sailed up the Nile to the Second Cataract. As his biographer stated, "His curiosity led him into areas few other Americans of his day even knew existed."&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; He was at Dendera at precisely the same time the French excavator Jean Baptiste Leloraine was removing the famed Circular or Dendera Zodiac from the roof of the Hathor Temple for transport to Paris. Bradish was consequently well versed in the excavations and archaeological intrigues of his time. He finally returned home to America in December 1825.

Thus Bradish was more conversant with contemporary American interests in the Middle East and with Egyptian archaeological excavations and the emerging field of biblical archaeology than any other contemporary American. Though not a linguist by training or profession, he knew firsthand of the rising interest in Egyptian hieroglyphics and antiquities. This fact coupled with the strong likelihood that Martin Harris and Luther Bradish were acquainted and that Bradish knew men in New York City renowned for their learning may explain why Harris visited Bradish in Albany before continuing on down the Hudson to New York City.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A Man to Be Obeyed": Dr. Charles Anthon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Our second wise man of the east was the young and coming scholar of linguistics, thirty-one-year-old Professor Charles Anthon (17971867), who had become a professor of languages at Columbia in 1820. While he later achieved fame for his 1825 edition of Lemprieres &lt;i&gt;Classical Dictionary,&lt;/i&gt; at the time of Harriss visit in 1828 Anthon was but an adjunct professor of Greek and Latin - more an accomplished grammarian than a prestigious scholar.

His first love was the classics, especially the works of Homer and Herodotus. While he had superb mastery of Greek, Latin, German, and French, there is little indication that he knew much about Egyptian, Hebrew, or any other Middle Eastern language. But because of his love of languages, he was probably aware of emerging research interests in Egyptian hieroglyphics and knew that Champollion had recently deciphered the ancient Egyptian writings on the Rosetta Stone.

By force of his own brusque personality, he laid claim to much greater knowledge in this area than he actually possessed. A bachelor, crotchety recluse, and strict disciplinarian with an iron constitution, Anthon rose early and retired late. A personal interview might elicit an unpleasant experience, as Anthon hated interruptions, whether from college administrators or lowly students. He shunned faculty parties and all forms of social life. His life was his books and the halls of academia. A man of decisive mannerisms, authoritarian bearing, ready wit, and "sometimes biting sarcasm," Anthon was clearly a "man to be obeyed."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Samuel L. Mitchill: "A Chaos of Knowledge"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third man in our story was the leading natural scientist in America: Professor Samuel Latham Mitchill, formerly of Columbia College and, at the time of Harriss visit, vice president of Rutgers Medical College in New York City. A Quaker from birth who was "rather short and inclining to corpulency," full faced with a "large double chin and a pleasant open countenance," Mitchill in 1828 was sixty-four and nearing the end of an illustrious career. He was regarded by presidents and paupers, farmers and fishermen, as one of Americas greatest minds and scholars, a man of the many and a friend of every class. He possessed a voracious curiosity and a "taste for . . . new discoveries."&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Eager to learn from everyone, no matter what their station in life, he was as gracious as Anthon was abrupt.

Born in Long Island, New York, in 1764, Mitchill graduated in medicine from the University of Edinburgh in 1786. Upon returning to America, he joined the faculty of Columbia College (formerly Kings College under the recently terminated British rule) as professor of chemistry, natural history, and agriculture. Here he taught for eleven years. In 1797 Mitchill launched Americas first medical/scientific journal, the &lt;i&gt;Medical Repository,&lt;/i&gt; and he remained its chief editor for eighteen years. He also founded and edited the &lt;i&gt;American Chemist&lt;/i&gt; and was a pioneer in the study of hydrogen and evaporation.

In 1799 he married Catharine ("Kate") Ackerly; from their voluminous correspondence they enjoyed a most felicitous relationship. A popular public figure, Mitchill served as an assemblyman in the New York Legislature (17971800), then resigned from Columbia in 1801 to serve until 1805 in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was then elected U.S. senator, a post he held until 1809. He was an ardent supporter of Robert Fultons efforts to build the first steamboat, which churned up the Hudson River in 1808, and was also an enthusiastic proponent of the Erie Canal, a major project of his friend Governor De Witt Clinton. As senator, Mitchill had supported President Jeffersons efforts to explore "certain remote and unknown parts of Louisiana" and worked hard to gain funding for the Louisiana Purchase.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Jefferson sent Mitchill and the American Philosophical Society several new specimens of flora and fauna forwarded to him by Lewis and Clark during their famous explorations westward.

A member of forty-nine different learned societies in eleven countries, he lectured widely and published papers on geography, earthquakes, hurricanes, hydrography, botany, and zoology. Author of several books and scores of articles on topics ranging from his groundbreaking study of the importance of sanitation in fighting pestilential disease to his massive report on the states ichthyology and fish species,&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; by the time he died on September 7, 1831, he had earned the plaudits of the great and the small. Benjamin Moore called him "a chaos of knowledge."&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; He was known among his colleagues as "the Nestor of American science,"&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; also the "Stalking Library,"&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; and "the Delphic Oracle of New York."&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; And even President Thomas Jefferson referred to him as the "Congressional Dictionary."&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; At his burial in Greenwood Cemetery in New York City, the sexton described Mitchill with the following: "A great character. One who knew all things on earth, and in the waters of the great deep."&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A Nation Now Extinct Which He Named"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In addition, Mitchill possessed special interests and experiences that may have prompted Bradish and Anthon to send Harris to see him: his intimate knowledge of the American Indian and New York States geology and mineralogy; a marked familiarity with western New York, including Ontario County, as well as with American antiquities; a knowledge of ancient languages and hieroglyphics; and finally, his genuine love of people.

His interest in Americas native peoples grew directly out of his careful observations and prodigious knowledge as perhaps the leading mineralogist and geologist of his time. A frequent visitor to Niagara, Ontario, Genesee, Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga counties, he had found and catalogued a great many salt-based sea fossils from this region.

Mitchills many expeditions significantly contributed to his massive collection or "museum" of geological specimens, which formed the basis of his "Mitchillian Cabinet" packed with fossils, rocks, skeletons, ancient artifacts, and specimens. His research interests had led him to discover several ancient Indian burial mounds and fortifications stretching across upstate New York from Sacketts Harbor to Boughton Hill in Ontario County and from Canandaigua to Onondaga. His lifelong friend and fervent admirer De Witt Clinton likewise came to consider such constructions to be of ancient origin, the places of great battles between ancient Indian tribes long before the arrival of the European races.

Trusted and highly respected, Mitchill had been adopted into the Mohawk fraternity, had learned their language, and had translated into English many of their Indian war songs. The Oneidas and the Onondagas had even bestowed personal names on him.&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; He sustained an abiding interest in Indian languages and later concluded that all tribal languages were derived from the same linguistic root. A longtime member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia; the Natural History Society of New York City; the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts; and many other contemporary centers of research; he shared his findings freely with contemporary colleagues and students of the American Indian at a time when much discussion focused on their origins and culture.

Stemming from his work with the Indian nations and from his years in the U.S. Senate as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Mitchill had developed his own theory on the origin of the ancient American Indians. He had come to the conviction that "three races of Malays, Tartars, and Scandinavians, contribute to make up the American population."&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Mitchill believed that the "Tartars" (as he called the originating stock) were primarily from northeastern Russia and China.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

After visiting various caves in Kentucky and carefully examining mummies and bones found there and elsewhere, he originated the idea that another "more delicate race" had once co-inhabited ancient America. He believed that this delicate race, whom he termed "Australasians" or "Malays," had originated in the Polynesian Islands. Their physical size and physiognomy "all have a perfect resemblance" to those of "the Sandwich, the Caroline, and the Fegee [Fiji] Islands," he asserted.&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; These tribes of "the lower latitudes" had "greater proficients [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;] in the arts" than their northern enemies, "particularly of making cloths, clearing the ground, and erecting works of defence."&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; They began with

&lt;i&gt;colonies of Australasians, or Malays,&lt;/i&gt; [who] &lt;i&gt;landed in North America, and penetrated across the continent, to the region lying between the Great Lakes and the Gulph of Mexico. There they resided, and constructed the fortifications, mounds, and other ancient structures, which every person who beholds them admires.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What has become of them? They have probably been overcome by the more warlike and ferocious hordes that entered our hemisphere from the northeast of Asia. These Tartars of the higher latitudes have issued from the great hive of nations, and desolated, in the course of their migrations, the southern tribes of America, as they have done to those of Asia and Europe. The greater part of the present American natives are of the Tartar stock, the descendants of the hardy warriours who destroyed the weaker Malays that preceded them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;

Mitchill had advanced his theory to the point that the Iroquois of New York were of "Tartar descent, who expelled or destroyed the former possessors of the fertile tracts reaching from Lake Ontario south westwardly to the River Ohio."&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;

Stanley Kimball argued that Mitchill knew little or nothing about ancient languages or hieroglyphics and therefore could not have substantiated much of what Anthon was saying.&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; That description may not be entirely accurate. When Martin Harris brought the characters to Mitchill, it was not the first time that Mitchill had received or had been shown hieroglyphics and transcriptions from other languages. He had already received hand-drawn hieroglyphics with possible translations from various regions of the globe. And he had on hand writings that he could compare to the characters Harris showed him. For instance, he had studied many such "Indian hieroglyphics" from the Mohawk languages.&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, along with his ability to read and translate classical Greek and Latin, he had also studied Oriental tongues and Hebrew. As early as 1817 American explorers to the Middle East had been sending to him writings and hieroglyphics from ancient Babylonian tombs and temples for his review, if not verification.

There remain two other significant reasons why Mitchill showed such interest in his Palmyra visitor. The first was the simple matter of timing. Harris could not have caught the good professor at a more propitious moment. For the previous eight years Mitchill had been busily propounding and publishing one aspect or another of his "two-races" theory of ancient America.&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; His interest in the history of the ancient American Indians was at a peak when Harris arrived. The second was Mitchills boundless curiosity, kindliness, and open and engaging personality. As important as anything the two men said to one another was the simple matter of personality, for Mitchill was a man who delighted in listening to, and learning from, all kinds of people. As one put it, he was "an interpreter to all their queries."&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; People from every walk or station of life felt comfortable talking with him about their discoveries and found in him a warm and receptive audience. Unlike Anthon, he was

&lt;i&gt;never disconcerted by intruders, however ignorant, or idle, or indiscreet - and managed to send each away contented. . . . No man was ever more universally accessible than he - holding so high a place in society, yet he condescended to the lowest without ostentation - descending even to the capacity of a child, to instruct, to encourage the love of study, or to amuse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;

Finally, there remains the intriguing possibility that historians for all these many years have viewed the whole story in reverse. In what might be the very first written record of Harris visit - predating Joseph Smiths 1832 history, E. D. Howes 1834 account, Lucy Mack Smiths 1844 story, and certainly B. H. Robertss version in the &lt;i&gt;History of the Church - &lt;/i&gt;the celebrated Scottish-born New York journalist James Gordon Bennett, then associate editor of the &lt;i&gt;Morning Courier and New York Enquirer,&lt;/i&gt;wrote in 1831 that Harris carried the engravings from the plates to New York and

&lt;i&gt;showed them to Professor Anthon who said that he did not know what language they were - told him to carry them to Dr. Mitchell&lt;/i&gt; [sic]. &lt;i&gt;Dr. Mitchell examined them - and compared them with other hieroglyphics - thought them very curious - and&lt;/i&gt; [said]&lt;i&gt;they were the characters of a nation now extinct which he named - Harris returned to Anthon who put some questions to him and got angry with Harris.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;

This account is elaborated upon in James Gordon Bennetts article, published in September 1831:

&lt;i&gt;They attempted to get the Book printed, but could not raise the means till Harris stept&lt;/i&gt; [sic] &lt;i&gt;forward, and raised money on his farm for that purpose. Harris with several manuscripts in his pocket, went to the city of New York, and called upon one of the Professors of Columbia College for the purpose of shewing them to him. Harris says that the Professor thought them very curious, but admitted that he could not decypher them. Said he to Harris, "Mr. Harris you had better go to the celebrated Doct. Mitchell and shew them to him. He is very learned in these ancient languages, and I have no doubt will be able to give you some satisfaction." "Where does he live," asked Harris. He was told, and off he posted with the engravings from the Golden Plates to submit to Doc. Mitchell - Harris says that the Doctor received him very "purlitely," looked at his engravings - made a learned dissertation on them - compared them with the hieroglyphics discovered by Champollion in Egypt - and set them down as the language of a people formerly in existence in the East, but now no more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;

Four elements in Bennetts account demand serious study. First, written in 1831, it is the earliest known record of Harris visit to New York City. Second, Bennett states that Anthon "did not know what language they were." This we now understand is correct, since Anthon was a grammarian, a promising but youthful scholar who knew virtually nothing about Egyptian, reformed Egyptian, or whatever kind of writings or characters were on the "Anthon Transcript." Third, the statement that Mitchill "compared" the transcript that Harris brought him with "other hieroglyphics" conforms to what we now know of Mitchill. He not only had many such writings on hand in his cabinets of antiquities, but he had also translated ancient writings for others. Whether he tried to translate Harris characters on the spot is not known, but he certainly seems to have studied them carefully enough to deliver a "learned dissertation" on them and to identify them as those of "a nation now extinct which he named." Finally, and almost certainly, he saw in these characters additional evidence for his own richly developed theories on the extinct "delicate" Australasian race that had been destroyed by the more ferocious Tartars somewhere in upstate New York not far from where Harris lived in Palmyra.

We may never know the full extent of the conversations Martin Harris had with Luther Bradish, Samuel Mitchill, or Charles Anthon that winter of 1828. While it is probably safe to say that the discussions between Harris and Anthon will ever prove more popular among Latter-day Saint readers as a fulfillment of prophecy, the fact remains that Harris found encouragement to pursue his sponsorship of the Book of Mormon not only from Anthon. It may well be that the secondary characters in this story - Luther Bradish and Samuel L. Mitchill - were far more important than we have previously supposed.

He therefore with his wife Drew of[f] the Caricters exactley like the ancient and sent Martin Harris to see if he Could git them Translated. He went to Albeny and to Philadelpha and to new york and he found men that Could Translate some of the Carictors in all those places. Mitchel [Samuel L. Mitchill] and Anthony [Charles Anthon] of New York ware the most Larded [learned] But there were some Caricters they could not well understand. Therefore Anthony told him that he thot if he had the original he culd translate it. And he rote a very good piece to Joseph and said if he would send the original he would translate it. But at Last Martin Harris told him that he Could not have the original for it was Commanded not to be shone. And he was mad and said what Does this mean, and he tore the paper that he wrote all to pieces and stampid it under his feet and says Bring me the original or I will not translate it. Mr Harris, seeing he was in a passion, he said, well I will go home and see, and if they can be had I will wright to you immeditely. So he Came home and told how it was and they went to him no more. Then was fulfild the 29th Chapter of Isiah." (In Dean Jessee, "Joseph Knights Recollection of Early Mormon History," &lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt; 17, no. 1 [autumn 1976]: 3435.)

			<p>The history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a "marvelous work and a wonder," an unfolding story of revelation, sacrifice, and faith. As a Church historian, I am continually amazed at why it is that some toss and tangle with our past to discredit their faith and that of those around them while others find solace, cheer, and comfort from our past. I am of the latter persuasion and have chosen to see the hand of the Lord not only in our history but also in the discovery of new understandings of His handiwork in the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days. If my bias is showing, it is only because of my firm testimony that in all its ups and downs, comings and goings, this is the Lords doing and His hand figures carefully, if not always prominently, in this great work. And as for Church history, we learn patiently "line upon line," or, as the scripture says: "But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it" (Romans 8:25). I wish to discuss one example of this today.</p>
<p>My purpose is to share with you new light on a very important episode in our history. In 1970 the late Stanley B. Kimball published an article in <i>BYU Studies</i> in which he examined the significance of the so-called "Anthon Transcript," the identity of the leading scholars who Martin Harris consulted in February 1828, and why Harris returned so committed to financing the printing of the Book of Mormon.<sup>1</sup> My specific purpose in delivering this much abridged version of a longer study I have recently published is to reveal the identity of the three "wise men" Harris visited - Luther Bradish, Charles Anthon, and Samuel L. Mitchill - and what in their background, training, and personalities uniquely prepared them for Harriss visit and why Harris left New York so resolved to pay for the Book of Mormons printing.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The outlines of this story are well known. In late 1827, working with the gold plates and the Urim and Thummim, Joseph Smith began translating the "reformed Egyptian" characters found in the book of Lehi on the large plates of Nephi. As part of this early work, he transcribed some of the characters as a sort of alphabet or reference guide. His primary scribe was then Martin Harris - a well-known and respected Palmyra farmer, an early and keen supporter of Joseph Smiths work, and later one of the Three Witnesses. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the resentment of his wife, Lucy, at his growing involvement, Harris persuaded Joseph to let him take a transcription to New York City, as historian B. H. Roberts wrote, "to submit them to men of learning for their inspection."<sup>3</sup> Roberts says Harris submitted "two papers containing different transcripts, to Professors Anthon and Mitchell [<i>sic</i>], of New York, one that was translated and one not translated."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>According to Anthons own accounts, Harris first visited Mitchill, who wrote him a letter referring him to Anthon,<sup>5</sup> who in turn "stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian" and that the characters "were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyric, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters . . . and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct."<sup>6</sup> However, when Harris said that an angel had given Joseph the book, Anthon tore up his certificate, vehemently denied the possibility of heavenly manifestations, and told Harris to bring him the plates, which he would translate. When Harris replied he could not do so and that parts of the plates were sealed, Anthon brusquely responded, "I cannot read a sealed book."<sup>7</sup> Harris promptly returned to Mitchill, "who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation."<sup>8</sup> Sometime later this entire episode came to be interpreted as fulfilling Isaiah 29:11, which speaks of "the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed."<sup>9</sup> Whatever else Harris gleaned from these leading scholars, they confirmed his beliefs and encouraged him to devote his time, energy, and resources to the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon. If he left Palmyra wondering and inquiring, Harris returned supporting and defending.</p>
<h2><b>Luther Bradish</b></h2>
<p>William W. Phelps recalled that Harris went to New York City by way of Albany, the state capital.<sup>10</sup> Pomeroy Tucker mentioned that "he sought . . . the interpretation and bibliological scrutiny of such scholars as Hon. Luther Bradish, Dr. Mitchell, Professor Anthon, and others."<sup>11</sup> Why was Harris interested in this man Bradish?</p>
<p>In 1828 Luther Bradish (17881863) was a newly elected member of the New York State Assembly who would later run for governor. Born and raised in Massachusetts, Bradish had lived for a considerable period of time in Palmyra, where his parents had moved in 1798. Bradish remained in Massachusetts to attend Williams College, graduating with a BA in 1804. After graduation he rejoined his parents in Palmyra before accepting a teaching post in 1806 at Union Hall Academy in Jamaica, Long Island. By 1810 Bradish had opted for a law career, and he became a very successful, relatively wealthy lawyer whose clients included such well-known literary figures as Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper. On several occasions, certainly in 1815 and again in 1819, he had made extensive visits to Palmyra.</p>
<p>Thus Martin Harris was calling on a man with whom he was already well acquainted. The Harris and Bradish families had both come to Palmyra in the 1790s. In 1804 both Martins and Luther Bradishs fathers were together elected as overseers of roads. By 1811 Martin Harris and Calvin Bradish, Luthers older brother, had replaced their fathers as overseers and worked together for a year.</p>
<p>In April 1816 Bradishs wife, Helen, died in giving birth to their son, who also perished. Bradish sought consolation or at least distraction by traveling abroad. A Whig like John Quincy Adams (then secretary of state and later U.S. president), Bradish applied for a special passport in 1820 offering to serve his country if it cared to take advantage of his whereabouts.</p>
<p>Adams was particularly interested in promoting American commercial interests with the Ottoman Empire at a time when acute tensions were developing between Turkey and the Muslim countries on the one side and Greece, Russia, and Great Britain on the other. England was especially wary about American interference in this volatile Mediterranean region. Thus Bradish went to Turkey as a private citizen but in a secret, quasi-official capacity. His assigned objectives were to discover whether American interests could be furthered by a treaty of amity and commerce with the Ottoman Empire; to determine the best way of accomplishing this objective; and, finally, to obtain free passage for American ships to Russian ports on the Black Sea. Secretly transported by American naval ships, young Bradish traveled to Constantinople, capital of the Ottoman Empire, which then held loose control over Egypt, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. With a special passport from the sultans government, Bradish secretly embarked for Egypt in February 1821. He stayed there for five months and held several meetings with the Egyptian ruler Mohammed Ali Pasha.</p>
<p>His visit to Egypt coincided with the "war of the consuls" between England and France over the archaeological spoils of Egypt, then being plundered by European excavators. Since Napoleons invasion of Egypt in 1798, an intense European interest in Egyptian antiquities had developed, highlighted by the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 and its eventual decipherment in 1822 by the brilliant French linguist Jean-Franois Champollion. Interest in all things Egyptian was at a fever pitch when Bradish, the only known American in Egypt at the time, sailed up the Nile to the Second Cataract. As his biographer stated, "His curiosity led him into areas few other Americans of his day even knew existed."<sup>12</sup> He was at Dendera at precisely the same time the French excavator Jean Baptiste Leloraine was removing the famed Circular or Dendera Zodiac from the roof of the Hathor Temple for transport to Paris. Bradish was consequently well versed in the excavations and archaeological intrigues of his time. He finally returned home to America in December 1825.</p>
<p>Thus Bradish was more conversant with contemporary American interests in the Middle East and with Egyptian archaeological excavations and the emerging field of biblical archaeology than any other contemporary American. Though not a linguist by training or profession, he knew firsthand of the rising interest in Egyptian hieroglyphics and antiquities. This fact coupled with the strong likelihood that Martin Harris and Luther Bradish were acquainted and that Bradish knew men in New York City renowned for their learning may explain why Harris visited Bradish in Albany before continuing on down the Hudson to New York City.</p>
<h2><b>"A Man to Be Obeyed": Dr. Charles Anthon</b></h2>
<p>Our second wise man of the east was the young and coming scholar of linguistics, thirty-one-year-old Professor Charles Anthon (17971867), who had become a professor of languages at Columbia in 1820. While he later achieved fame for his 1825 edition of Lemprieres <i>Classical Dictionary,</i> at the time of Harriss visit in 1828 Anthon was but an adjunct professor of Greek and Latin - more an accomplished grammarian than a prestigious scholar.</p>
<p>His first love was the classics, especially the works of Homer and Herodotus. While he had superb mastery of Greek, Latin, German, and French, there is little indication that he knew much about Egyptian, Hebrew, or any other Middle Eastern language. But because of his love of languages, he was probably aware of emerging research interests in Egyptian hieroglyphics and knew that Champollion had recently deciphered the ancient Egyptian writings on the Rosetta Stone.</p>
<p>By force of his own brusque personality, he laid claim to much greater knowledge in this area than he actually possessed. A bachelor, crotchety recluse, and strict disciplinarian with an iron constitution, Anthon rose early and retired late. A personal interview might elicit an unpleasant experience, as Anthon hated interruptions, whether from college administrators or lowly students. He shunned faculty parties and all forms of social life. His life was his books and the halls of academia. A man of decisive mannerisms, authoritarian bearing, ready wit, and "sometimes biting sarcasm," Anthon was clearly a "man to be obeyed."<sup>13</sup></p>
<h2><b>Samuel L. Mitchill: "A Chaos of Knowledge"</b></h2>
<p>The third man in our story was the leading natural scientist in America: Professor Samuel Latham Mitchill, formerly of Columbia College and, at the time of Harriss visit, vice president of Rutgers Medical College in New York City. A Quaker from birth who was "rather short and inclining to corpulency," full faced with a "large double chin and a pleasant open countenance," Mitchill in 1828 was sixty-four and nearing the end of an illustrious career. He was regarded by presidents and paupers, farmers and fishermen, as one of Americas greatest minds and scholars, a man of the many and a friend of every class. He possessed a voracious curiosity and a "taste for . . . new discoveries."<sup>14</sup> Eager to learn from everyone, no matter what their station in life, he was as gracious as Anthon was abrupt.</p>
<p>Born in Long Island, New York, in 1764, Mitchill graduated in medicine from the University of Edinburgh in 1786. Upon returning to America, he joined the faculty of Columbia College (formerly Kings College under the recently terminated British rule) as professor of chemistry, natural history, and agriculture. Here he taught for eleven years. In 1797 Mitchill launched Americas first medical/scientific journal, the <i>Medical Repository,</i> and he remained its chief editor for eighteen years. He also founded and edited the <i>American Chemist</i> and was a pioneer in the study of hydrogen and evaporation.</p>
<p>In 1799 he married Catharine ("Kate") Ackerly; from their voluminous correspondence they enjoyed a most felicitous relationship. A popular public figure, Mitchill served as an assemblyman in the New York Legislature (17971800), then resigned from Columbia in 1801 to serve until 1805 in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was then elected U.S. senator, a post he held until 1809. He was an ardent supporter of Robert Fultons efforts to build the first steamboat, which churned up the Hudson River in 1808, and was also an enthusiastic proponent of the Erie Canal, a major project of his friend Governor De Witt Clinton. As senator, Mitchill had supported President Jeffersons efforts to explore "certain remote and unknown parts of Louisiana" and worked hard to gain funding for the Louisiana Purchase.<sup>15</sup> Jefferson sent Mitchill and the American Philosophical Society several new specimens of flora and fauna forwarded to him by Lewis and Clark during their famous explorations westward.</p>
<p>A member of forty-nine different learned societies in eleven countries, he lectured widely and published papers on geography, earthquakes, hurricanes, hydrography, botany, and zoology. Author of several books and scores of articles on topics ranging from his groundbreaking study of the importance of sanitation in fighting pestilential disease to his massive report on the states ichthyology and fish species,<sup>16</sup> by the time he died on September 7, 1831, he had earned the plaudits of the great and the small. Benjamin Moore called him "a chaos of knowledge."<sup>17</sup> He was known among his colleagues as "the Nestor of American science,"<sup>18</sup> also the "Stalking Library,"<sup>19</sup> and "the Delphic Oracle of New York."<sup>20</sup> And even President Thomas Jefferson referred to him as the "Congressional Dictionary."<sup>21</sup> At his burial in Greenwood Cemetery in New York City, the sexton described Mitchill with the following: "A great character. One who knew all things on earth, and in the waters of the great deep."<sup>22</sup></p>
<h2><b>"A Nation Now Extinct Which He Named"</b></h2>
<p>In addition, Mitchill possessed special interests and experiences that may have prompted Bradish and Anthon to send Harris to see him: his intimate knowledge of the American Indian and New York States geology and mineralogy; a marked familiarity with western New York, including Ontario County, as well as with American antiquities; a knowledge of ancient languages and hieroglyphics; and finally, his genuine love of people.</p>
<p>His interest in Americas native peoples grew directly out of his careful observations and prodigious knowledge as perhaps the leading mineralogist and geologist of his time. A frequent visitor to Niagara, Ontario, Genesee, Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga counties, he had found and catalogued a great many salt-based sea fossils from this region.</p>
<p>Mitchills many expeditions significantly contributed to his massive collection or "museum" of geological specimens, which formed the basis of his "Mitchillian Cabinet" packed with fossils, rocks, skeletons, ancient artifacts, and specimens. His research interests had led him to discover several ancient Indian burial mounds and fortifications stretching across upstate New York from Sacketts Harbor to Boughton Hill in Ontario County and from Canandaigua to Onondaga. His lifelong friend and fervent admirer De Witt Clinton likewise came to consider such constructions to be of ancient origin, the places of great battles between ancient Indian tribes long before the arrival of the European races.</p>
<p>Trusted and highly respected, Mitchill had been adopted into the Mohawk fraternity, had learned their language, and had translated into English many of their Indian war songs. The Oneidas and the Onondagas had even bestowed personal names on him.<sup>23</sup> He sustained an abiding interest in Indian languages and later concluded that all tribal languages were derived from the same linguistic root. A longtime member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia; the Natural History Society of New York City; the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts; and many other contemporary centers of research; he shared his findings freely with contemporary colleagues and students of the American Indian at a time when much discussion focused on their origins and culture.</p>
<p>Stemming from his work with the Indian nations and from his years in the U.S. Senate as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Mitchill had developed his own theory on the origin of the ancient American Indians. He had come to the conviction that "three races of Malays, Tartars, and Scandinavians, contribute to make up the American population."<sup>24</sup> Mitchill believed that the "Tartars" (as he called the originating stock) were primarily from northeastern Russia and China.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>After visiting various caves in Kentucky and carefully examining mummies and bones found there and elsewhere, he originated the idea that another "more delicate race" had once co-inhabited ancient America. He believed that this delicate race, whom he termed "Australasians" or "Malays," had originated in the Polynesian Islands. Their physical size and physiognomy "all have a perfect resemblance" to those of "the Sandwich, the Caroline, and the Fegee [Fiji] Islands," he asserted.<sup>26</sup> These tribes of "the lower latitudes" had "greater proficients [<i>sic</i>] in the arts" than their northern enemies, "particularly of making cloths, clearing the ground, and erecting works of defence."<sup>27</sup> They began with</p>
<p><i>colonies of Australasians, or Malays,</i> [who] <i>landed in North America, and penetrated across the continent, to the region lying between the Great Lakes and the Gulph of Mexico. There they resided, and constructed the fortifications, mounds, and other ancient structures, which every person who beholds them admires.</i></p>
<p><i>What has become of them? They have probably been overcome by the more warlike and ferocious hordes that entered our hemisphere from the northeast of Asia. These Tartars of the higher latitudes have issued from the great hive of nations, and desolated, in the course of their migrations, the southern tribes of America, as they have done to those of Asia and Europe. The greater part of the present American natives are of the Tartar stock, the descendants of the hardy warriours who destroyed the weaker Malays that preceded them.</i><sup>28</sup></p>
<p>Mitchill had advanced his theory to the point that the Iroquois of New York were of "Tartar descent, who expelled or destroyed the former possessors of the fertile tracts reaching from Lake Ontario south westwardly to the River Ohio."<sup>29</sup></p>
<p>Stanley Kimball argued that Mitchill knew little or nothing about ancient languages or hieroglyphics and therefore could not have substantiated much of what Anthon was saying.<sup>30</sup> That description may not be entirely accurate. When Martin Harris brought the characters to Mitchill, it was not the first time that Mitchill had received or had been shown hieroglyphics and transcriptions from other languages. He had already received hand-drawn hieroglyphics with possible translations from various regions of the globe. And he had on hand writings that he could compare to the characters Harris showed him. For instance, he had studied many such "Indian hieroglyphics" from the Mohawk languages.<sup>31</sup> Furthermore, along with his ability to read and translate classical Greek and Latin, he had also studied Oriental tongues and Hebrew. As early as 1817 American explorers to the Middle East had been sending to him writings and hieroglyphics from ancient Babylonian tombs and temples for his review, if not verification.</p>
<p>There remain two other significant reasons why Mitchill showed such interest in his Palmyra visitor. The first was the simple matter of timing. Harris could not have caught the good professor at a more propitious moment. For the previous eight years Mitchill had been busily propounding and publishing one aspect or another of his "two-races" theory of ancient America.<sup>32</sup> His interest in the history of the ancient American Indians was at a peak when Harris arrived. The second was Mitchills boundless curiosity, kindliness, and open and engaging personality. As important as anything the two men said to one another was the simple matter of personality, for Mitchill was a man who delighted in listening to, and learning from, all kinds of people. As one put it, he was "an interpreter to all their queries."<sup>33</sup> People from every walk or station of life felt comfortable talking with him about their discoveries and found in him a warm and receptive audience. Unlike Anthon, he was</p>
<p><i>never disconcerted by intruders, however ignorant, or idle, or indiscreet - and managed to send each away contented. . . . No man was ever more universally accessible than he - holding so high a place in society, yet he condescended to the lowest without ostentation - descending even to the capacity of a child, to instruct, to encourage the love of study, or to amuse.</i><sup>34</sup></p>
<p>Finally, there remains the intriguing possibility that historians for all these many years have viewed the whole story in reverse. In what might be the very first written record of Harris visit - predating Joseph Smiths 1832 history, E. D. Howes 1834 account, Lucy Mack Smiths 1844 story, and certainly B. H. Robertss version in the <i>History of the Church - </i>the celebrated Scottish-born New York journalist James Gordon Bennett, then associate editor of the <i>Morning Courier and New York Enquirer,</i>wrote in 1831 that Harris carried the engravings from the plates to New York and</p>
<p><i>showed them to Professor Anthon who said that he did not know what language they were - told him to carry them to Dr. Mitchell</i> [sic]. <i>Dr. Mitchell examined them - and compared them with other hieroglyphics - thought them very curious - and</i> [said]<i>they were the characters of a nation now extinct which he named - Harris returned to Anthon who put some questions to him and got angry with Harris.</i><sup>35</sup></p>
<p>This account is elaborated upon in James Gordon Bennetts article, published in September 1831:</p>
<p><i>They attempted to get the Book printed, but could not raise the means till Harris stept</i> [sic] <i>forward, and raised money on his farm for that purpose. Harris with several manuscripts in his pocket, went to the city of New York, and called upon one of the Professors of Columbia College for the purpose of shewing them to him. Harris says that the Professor thought them very curious, but admitted that he could not decypher them. Said he to Harris, "Mr. Harris you had better go to the celebrated Doct. Mitchell and shew them to him. He is very learned in these ancient languages, and I have no doubt will be able to give you some satisfaction." "Where does he live," asked Harris. He was told, and off he posted with the engravings from the Golden Plates to submit to Doc. Mitchell - Harris says that the Doctor received him very "purlitely," looked at his engravings - made a learned dissertation on them - compared them with the hieroglyphics discovered by Champollion in Egypt - and set them down as the language of a people formerly in existence in the East, but now no more.</i><sup>36</sup></p>
<p>Four elements in Bennetts account demand serious study. First, written in 1831, it is the earliest known record of Harris visit to New York City. Second, Bennett states that Anthon "did not know what language they were." This we now understand is correct, since Anthon was a grammarian, a promising but youthful scholar who knew virtually nothing about Egyptian, reformed Egyptian, or whatever kind of writings or characters were on the "Anthon Transcript." Third, the statement that Mitchill "compared" the transcript that Harris brought him with "other hieroglyphics" conforms to what we now know of Mitchill. He not only had many such writings on hand in his cabinets of antiquities, but he had also translated ancient writings for others. Whether he tried to translate Harris characters on the spot is not known, but he certainly seems to have studied them carefully enough to deliver a "learned dissertation" on them and to identify them as those of "a nation now extinct which he named." Finally, and almost certainly, he saw in these characters additional evidence for his own richly developed theories on the extinct "delicate" Australasian race that had been destroyed by the more ferocious Tartars somewhere in upstate New York not far from where Harris lived in Palmyra.</p>
<p>We may never know the full extent of the conversations Martin Harris had with Luther Bradish, Samuel Mitchill, or Charles Anthon that winter of 1828. While it is probably safe to say that the discussions between Harris and Anthon will ever prove more popular among Latter-day Saint readers as a fulfillment of prophecy, the fact remains that Harris found encouragement to pursue his sponsorship of the Book of Mormon not only from Anthon. It may well be that the secondary characters in this story - Luther Bradish and Samuel L. Mitchill - were far more important than we have previously supposed.</p>

<p>9. Joseph Knight, "sometime" between 1833 and 1847, remembered the story this way: "[Joseph Smith] Began to be anxious to git them translated. He therefore with his wife Drew of[f] the Caricters exactley like the ancient and sent Martin Harris to see if he Could git them Translated. He went to Albeny and to Philadelpha and to new york and he found men that Could Translate some of the Carictors in all those places. Mitchel [Samuel L. Mitchill] and Anthony [Charles Anthon] of New York ware the most Larded [learned] But there were some Caricters they could not well understand. Therefore Anthony told him that he thot if he had the original he culd translate it. And he rote a very good piece to Joseph and said if he would send the original he would translate it. But at Last Martin Harris told him that he Could not have the original for it was Commanded not to be shone. And he was mad and said what Does this mean, and he tore the paper that he wrote all to pieces and stampid it under his feet and says Bring me the original or I will not translate it. Mr Harris, seeing he was in a passion, he said, well I will go home and see, and if they can be had I will wright to you immeditely. So he Came home and told how it was and they went to him no more. Then was fulfild the 29th Chapter of Isiah." (In Dean Jessee, "Joseph Knights Recollection of Early Mormon History," <i>BYU Studies</i> 17, no. 1 [autumn 1976]: 3435.)</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you for your welcome today at Brigham Young University. I love this university, and I feel blessed by every opportunity to feel the spirit that is unique to this campus. Because of my service on the Church Board of Education, I can testify of the Lords interest in this marvelous institution, and, in your honor, I wore my best BYU blue today.
As I have pondered this opportunity to speak to you, a number of different subjects came to my mind. I thought I might try to add to the teaching you have had about dating, marriage, and establishing eternal families. Or some people suggested that I speak to you about your dress and appearance. I even thought about saying some things about what your mother wishes you had learned before you left home. But the Spirit has persisted in giving me ideas about why we are organized into quorums and Relief Societies.
Although this is probably an unusual topic for most of you to consider, I hope the Spirit will use me to teach you some things that will bless your lives as you continue to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and contribute to building His kingdom.
When I was a young girl my father was called to preside over the Brazilian Mission. At that time there was only one mission in Brazil. There were no stakes or wards; there wasnt an elders quorum in the country. That means there were no home teachers. There were over forty branches, which were generally presided over by missionaries who conducted a weekly sacrament meeting and sometimes held Sunday School and branch activities. My father had served as a stake president and a bishop prior to his call as a mission president, and he had an understanding of how to establish the Lords Church. He began to organize branches and districts in the pattern we are familiar with today in anticipation of future stakes and wards.
To begin the organization, some priorities were followed. First, a branch president and then an elders quorum president and a Relief Society president were called. It was understood that there could be no functioning branch without a quorum president and a Relief Society president.
As the Prophet Joseph Smith began establishing the Church in this dispensation, the Lord directed him to follow similar inspired patterns. When he set the course for the Relief Society, he told the sisters they were organized "under the priesthood after the pattern of the priesthood."1 This gave the sisters official responsibilities in the restored Church and the authority to function in those responsibilities. This was a pattern similar to that given to a president of a quorum of elders, who was to counsel with his presidency.2
Before we can understand why we are thus organized, it may be helpful to review the definition of a priesthood quorum and a Relief Society. Many people have the mistaken idea that a quorum or a Relief Society is merely a class or a place to sit during</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June of 1843 the Prophet Joseph Smith announced the appointment of apostle Orson Hyde and George J. Adams to serve as missionaries in "that vast empire" of Russia, with which, he continued, are connected "some of the most important things concerning the advancement and building up of the kingdom of God in the last days, which cannot be explained at this time" (HC 6:41). Although months of preparation followed this announcement, the two men never served in Russia.
Much later, in 1903, the land of Russia was dedicated for missionary work by an apostle, Francis M. Lyman, who offered dedicatory prayers in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Subsequently, many Church leaders and members, professional men and women, statesmen, educators, and, significantly, BYU performing groups helped prepare the way for the introduction of the restored gospel to Russia.
It was especially during Gorbachevs era of glasnost, beginning in 1985, that conditions gradually became favorable for establishing a mission in that country. In particular, Elder Russell M. Nelson, assisted by European area president Hans B. Ringger and Austria Vienna East and Finland Helsinki mission presidents Dennis B. Neuenschwander and Steven R. Mecham, established vital contacts, opened doors long closed, and commenced the missionary effort.
By the time my wife and I, accompanied by our three youngest children - Betsy, Katie, and Jon - arrived to begin our missionary service in what was originally named the Finland Helsinki East Mission, three young, but already flourishing, branches of the Church existed: the largest in Leningrad, with nearly a hundred members; then Tallinn, Estonia, with almost fifty members; and Vyborg (located between Helsinki and Leningrad), with approximately twenty-five members.
Many of the earliest Russian and Estonian members joined the Church while visiting abroad in Europe and, especially, Finland. Finnish members of the Church, among them the Kemppainens, Jakkos, Laitinens, Kirsis, Lammintauses, Rotos, and Forsmans, were particularly active in friendshipping, teaching, fellowshipping, and training Soviet members and their friends.
Soon President Mecham in Finland received authorization to send the first fulltime Finland Helsinki missionaries - mainly Americans who had previously studied Russian - for a few days at a time to conduct home teaching and fellowshipping visits in the apartments of baptized members living in the USSR. While with members, these Finnish and American Church representatives answered members and their nonmember friends questions and taught them about the Church and, if requested, gospel doctrine.
Among the factors that inhibited our missionary work was the millennium-long and very rich heritage of the Russian Orthodox Church, so tightly interwoven into societys cultural, educational, and political lives. On the other end of the spectrum are over seven decades of official atheism</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you and would like to invite you to explore with me some ways of applying gospel truth. I prefer to define this process as exploring avenues of application rather than as a mere erudite academic inquiry. The kingdom of God is not a spectator sport. It is an action process requiring learning, commitment, and a special kind of understanding in order to translate truth into action. So I ask you to engage in that process - exploring ways of applying gospel truths.
Organizations and Relationships
As a focus for our discussion, I would like to emphasize one important area of gospel truth. Of the many ways to define the purpose of the gospel, let me suggest one for your consideration - the idea of the gospel as a mechanism that (1) defines the meaning of certain organizations, and (2) establishes a set of criteria for quality relationships within those organizations. Now, if this sounds suspiciously close to my academic field, it is. But after all, what else is there besides people behaving, relating, making mistakes, learning, changing, growing?
We have many scriptures and pronouncements from prophets that emphasize the significance of a series of organizations: the family, the neighborhood, the community, the state, the occupational world, the Church, and, ultimately, the kingdom of heaven. The value of the individual is defined and worth is measured in terms of the quality of the relationships we develop in each of these organizational settings: husband and wife, parent and child, individual and neighbor, individual and community, individual and state, individual and occupational setting, individual and the Church, and, finally, individual and God. The principle and ordinances of the gospel are geared not indirectly, but directly, to teaching us what it takes to develop quality relationships in each of these settings. The degree to which we attain those quality relationships is a determinant of our place in the kingdom of God.
Counseling with God
I would like to suggest as a text the book of Psalms, where David, reflecting on the challenge of reconciliation with God, cries and struggles as he attempts to escape the consequences of his behavior. In the Twenty-third Psalm David pleads for solace, peace, safety, and protection, but in the Fifty-fifth Psalm he attempts to redefine his relationship with God. In his appeal, he expresses the wish "Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I flyaway, and be at rest" (Psalms 55:6). Of course he found he could not. He couldnt hide. It wasnt like a military encounter, where he could prove himself by leading the armies of Israel. He had to come to terms with himself. He had to accept Gods definition of a quality relationship both with others (some of whom he had mistreated) and, most significantly, with God. In so doing, he described God as "a man mine equal" - an interest</span>

I think that I have never seen this many people in this building before, and to know that you are all here worshipping God and wanting to hear more about his work makes me feel very humble before you.
But I want you to know that I am grateful for the privilege of being here; I am grateful for the inspiration you are to me; I am grateful for this great University and for the marvelous work that it is doing, not only on this campus but in many parts of the world as your groups travel from place to place.
I believe that you represent one of the finest testimonies for the truthfulness of this Church for which we could ask. It is a marvelous thing in a day like this, with all of the difficulties there are in the world, to have this many young people all under one roof - more than 20,000 of you - here believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and coming to worship him and to receive the gift of his Holy Spirit as you sit here. I think that it is a great tribute to the Church, and a great tribute to all of you and to the homes from which you come, and that it shows the depth of your conversion.
When President Pearson spoke about the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought it would be quite appropriate to read one of the testimonies that Paul gave of the Savior. It is one of the finest that we have in holy writ - it is found in the first chapter of Colossians, verses fourteen through eighteen. He is talking here about the Savior:
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
For by him were all things created [and that is something that we should remember], that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist:
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
What a marvelous testimony to the Savior! You remember that when Paul wrote of the Savior to the Hebrews and said very much the same thing in the first and second verses of the first chapter of that epistle.
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets,
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.
Again Paul testifies that Jesus Christ is the Creator and that creation came about by an act of the Son of God. It did not come about by accident; it did not come about just spontaneously. It came about by an act of God working through the Son, Jesus Christ. And that is why John spoke </span>
