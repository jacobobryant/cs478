  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; Good morning! We add our voice of welcome to all of you at the beginning of a new year and new winter semester. While it is chilly outside, you exude a warmth that is both pleasant and encouraging. We join you in looking forward to an exciting and productive experience as we push forward to make 2014 one of our best years ever.

Two years ago, in the devotional that began the 2012 winter semester, we spoke to the theme of things that we appreciate most about BYU. Some may recall that we mentioned our Mission and Aims statements, our Honor Code, and our opportunities to attend devotionals and to speak freely about our faith and testimonies. We do not plan to repeat that message today but have chosen to discuss a similar, but different, topic: the reason we do some of the things we do at BYU. We intend our focus to reach far beyond the local culture and environment that we on campus experience and enjoy.

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; In the October 1999 general conference priesthood session, President Gordon B. Hinckley, then our prophet and chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees, gave an interesting address concerning some of the things our sponsoring Church does and why they are done. At that time Sharon and I were not at BYU and had absolutely no inkling that I would have the assignment that has occupied us these last several years. Because he was the president of the Church and also because I occasionally wondered about some of these things myself, I was particularly interested in the matters he might choose to address in the limited time remaining in that great priesthood gathering.

Before speaking to any specific topics, President Hinckley’s prefatory comments included the following:

&lt;i&gt;Our great mission is to testify of&lt;/i&gt; [Jesus Christ’s] &lt;i&gt;living reality. We should not be involved with anything not in harmony with this major objective. We should be involved with whatever is in harmony with this objective. &lt;/i&gt;[“Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;November 1999, 52]

He then went on to address this question: Why does the Church sponsor BYU? (See “Why We Do,” 52.)

We wish our time this morning would allow us to repeat all he said on that occasion. His impressive message is widely available electronically and in print, and I commend its careful reading and study to all who have an interest in this great institution of BYU specifically and in Church education generally.

President Hinckley began by declaring that the Church’s support for education has a doctrinal root in the Doctrine and Covenants.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; Then he quoted these important verses from Doctrine and Covenants 88:78–80:

&lt;i&gt;Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms—&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; President Hinckley lamented that because of the great expense related to BYU and other Church educational efforts, it is not possible to serve all those who would like and deserve this great learning experience. He said the Church would try to make it available to as many as possible through BYU, our other schools, institutes of religion, and seminaries. He mentioned how grateful all who are here should be as well as his disappointment with the occasional person who complains or does not seem to appreciate the unique opportunity to be at BYU.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; President Hinckley then went on to say the following:

&lt;i&gt;Moreover, the university has brought much favorable notice to the Church. Its sponsoring organization, the Church, is widely recognized. It has become known for standards and ideals which have been written about and talked about and which have let the world know of those things in which we believe. Its academic programs and its athletic programs have both brought honor to the university and the Church. And as generations of students move through its halls and on to graduation and then out across the world, they will bring honor to their alma mater and its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. &lt;/i&gt;[“Why We Do,” 52–53]

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; President Hinckley made further comments and assurances about BYU and Church education generally before moving on to other important topics, but it is very clear how our prophet leaders think about BYU. We feel it appropriate that we should express some pleasure and comfort about this remarkable support and reassurance, but we also hope all at BYU feel the tremendous responsibility this entails for everyone so associated with Brigham Young University. With that heavy but blessed burden in mind, let us now delve into a few of the reasons that we at BYU do some of the things we do.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; First, let us mention you students. After all, it would be a very difficult proposition to make the case for having a university without students. We are aware that at some places and at some times, it may seem to those studying that they are viewed as a necessary nuisance rather than a fundamental reason for the establishment of a university. Should that ever be the case, please read and carefully consider those verses from section 88 that President Hinckley quoted and that we have repeated today. For BYU to be the best it can be, the students who study here and represent the university in so many ways must also strive to be the best they can be.

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; All of you students have been very carefully selected. Your excellence in academic achievement and potential are widely understood—and at least as important in our admissions considerations is your “fit” for BYU, meaning your willingness and capacity to meet and follow the mission and aims of a BYU education. Our Honor Code, our commitment to service to others, and striving to be spiritually strengthened go hand in hand—all being essential for successful students at BYU. It is this inspired combination of values and attributes that reflect the now widely recognized ability of BYU graduates to serve their families, churches, communities, and nations with such effectiveness and remarkable contributions. You who come here are not perfect, nor is the admissions process perfect, nor anyone or anything else at BYU, but hopefully you and others will understand the breadth of prayerful consideration that goes into our admissions decisions and also the sadness we feel that we cannot accommodate more who would like to come and who could grow and contribute.

Second, we work very hard at continually striving to improve the quality of the university in both broad and narrow ways. In many respects, the measure of a great university is found in the caliber and attributes of its faculty. BYU has always been blessed with a devoted and committed faculty. Over our history from humble beginnings, we have had a gradual but significant strengthening of our faculty in all of its dimensions. In virtually every discipline in which we are engaged, we now have professors and colleagues who have achieved broad distinction in their endeavors while keeping their primary focus on our tremendous students. Our mentoring efforts and successes, for example, have led to national leadership among universities in placing our graduates in the most outstanding graduate and professional education programs in the United States and abroad.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; Third, we have the responsibility to become a light unto the world wherever we can. President Hinckley mentioned both our academics and athletics. In each of these areas, and in others as well, we have continued to advance, and, had we time today, we could list for you many successes and much recognition that have continued to bring acclaim to both BYU and our sponsoring Church.

By now I am sure that some of you wonder if we think our primary responsibility at BYU is to brag. Let us defend ourselves a little by sharing just two bits of homespun philosophy you may or may not recognize. First, someone once said, “If you done it, it ain’t bragging.” Second, Ann Landers, the former queen of etiquette, in a newspaper column said, “Bragging is not an attractive trait, but let us be honest. A man who catches a big fish does not go home through an alley” (Ann Landers nugget of the day, 20 January 1989).

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; We fully realize the potential conflict or confusion between what Jesus said about “let[ting] your light so shine” (Matthew 5:16) and keeping your “candle . . . under a bushel” (Matthew 5:15). Our purpose today is to be clear about why we do some of the things we do at BYU and the potential impact for good that these things have not only for the Church but also for the university and for others as well.

Although there are many examples supporting the premise that we must share what we do at BYU as well as render service broadly, time allows us only a brief glimpse at a few matters. Most would be aware that we have frequent visits to campus from people of prominence who represent the best of many cultures, professions, and peoples. We invite them because of what they can teach us and help us better understand about the world around us, but we also are anxious to host them on campus because of what it is they may learn and better understand about who and what we are. Our students have the regular privilege of hearing these distinguished visitors in addresses and classroom discussions.

We also host conferences that have gained wide recognition and appeal. Just one example would be the Law and Religion Symposium that is jointly sponsored by the J. Reuben Clark Law School and our supporting Church. Here we bring distinguished legal scholars and governmental leaders who share our concerns about the importance of religious liberty throughout the world. As with many of our impressive visitors, a number of them might find it awkward to respond to an invitation to visit our Church leaders alone but feel it quite natural to come to a renowned university of quality to participate in significant learning, teaching, and sharing. This would not be possible if Brigham Young University did not have a reputation as a fine and serious academic institution.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; BYU also has a tradition of solid outreach throughout the world. For many years we have had the opportunity to send volunteer teachers to China, for example, to teach English and increase appreciation for Western thought and cooperation. Our nursing students and faculty, our engineering students and faculty, and several of our outstanding performing groups have increased friendships and cooperation all around the globe. All of these things are expensive, and all are opportunities that bring friendship, gratitude, and recognition to and an understanding of BYU and our sponsoring Church.

Likewise, we regularly have some remarkable events on campus that have a major impact locally and afar. Currently the BYU Museum of Art is hosting the &lt;i&gt;Sacred Gifts&lt;/i&gt; exhibit, which displays some of the finest religious artwork of Carl Bloch, Heinrich Hofmann, and Frans Schwartz. Most of these pieces are on loan to BYU from Denmark, Sweden, and the Riverside Church in New York City. Our friends in Europe have allowed them to come because of the respect and trust enjoyed there by BYU and its museum of art. These paintings have never left Denmark before and likely never will again. We hope you will take the opportunity to see these wonderful masterpieces.

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; Over the decade we have been at BYU, both at home and as we have traveled, we have had many personal experiences that emphasize and clarify the point Sharon has just made. My dear, why don’t you tell our friends about the remarkable trip we took to Rome, Italy, with Noel and Sydney Reynolds and Christian Heal soon after we arrived at BYU in 2003?

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; Although we had been to Rome a couple of times before, we were very excited to have a unique experience with these colleagues because we had been invited to the Vatican Library by Catholic leaders to discuss a cooperative venture regarding the preservation and translation of ancient Syriac texts that the Vatican Library possesses. We were treated cordially and respectfully as details of our continued cooperation with the library were discussed. Never before had we understood to this degree how important the substantial and serious scholarship going on at BYU is in making friends and having a positive influence for the university and the Church throughout the world. We are pleased that this special project continues and also several others that could equally be mentioned. Even though most of our students might not be fully aware of such activities, they are extremely important and valuable in the broader work and initiatives of Brigham Young University.

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; For many years the Division of Continuing Education at BYU has blessed thousands of lives by providing courses and instruction, increasingly online, for those living far from campus.

As another example, an increasingly significant part of our educational outreach activities is found in the various venues of BYU Broadcasting. Through the combined efforts of BYUtv, KBYU, BYU Radio, BYUtv International, and our 24/7 Internet streaming around the world, we are reaching millions of people. In the United States alone BYUtv is now in about 50 million households. In 2009 BYUtv was found in only one Nielsen rating measurable market. In 2013 that figure had risen to forty-six of the major markets in the USA.

Before we say more about what we are doing with BYU Broadcasting, let us return to the words of President Hinckley in the 1999 address we mentioned at the beginning of our remarks today. As he spoke of our sponsoring Church, President Hinckley reminded us that “it is concerned primarily with worship of the Lord Jesus Christ” (“Why We Do,” 52). Therefore, all that we do ultimately must be in harmony with that key objective and responsibility. That is why in 2009 our BYU Broadcasting efforts adopted the slogan of “Seeing the Good in the World.” When you read the words of the Savior in Matthew 5, you will see the roots of that phrasing.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; Now, how is that to be accomplished? Many of you know that I am an avid BYU sports fan. While we both attend as many sporting events, lectures, and musical and dramatic presentations as we can, we are extremely grateful that we can follow many of these events on BYUtv when we cannot personally be in attendance. In this we are not unique. We know of those who have tuned into one of our television or radio stations to watch or listen to a sporting event and have stayed tuned to other programming because they really do want to “see the good in the world.”

Programs like &lt;i&gt;Granite Flats, Studio C, American Ride, The Story Trek, &lt;/i&gt;and others have a large following among our BYU and Church communities, but they have also attracted many not of our faith because of the wholesome quality of these programs. Let’s listen to what a few have had to say about their BYUtv experiences.

&lt;b&gt;[Some short video clips were shown.]&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; Several years ago the Church Missionary Department developed a strategy that we have borrowed and refined at BYUtv. While surveys of various kinds have demonstrated that people describe their desire for the increased availability of wholesome and educational television programming, it is clear from viewing patterns that the primary motivation for choosing a particular program or event is to be entertained. Thus you see in our programming that we do seek to have high-quality entertainment that is uplifting and clean but also that tends first to engage and then enlighten the viewers. It is common for people to become aware of our devotionals, general conference sessions, and Mormon Tabernacle Choir broadcasts, as well as scripture roundtables and other Church-sponsored events, while simply, at least initially, seeking just to be entertained.

&lt;b&gt;SGS:&lt;/b&gt; Likewise, many good people have been introduced to wonderful, uplifting programming attractive to people of many faiths by shows such as &lt;i&gt;Fires of Faith, Silent Night, &lt;/i&gt;and the upcoming production on Handel’s &lt;i&gt;Messiah&lt;/i&gt; that will premiere later this year. Let’s view just a couple of brief clips from these programs that have gained national acclaim and attention.

&lt;b&gt;[Some short video clips were shown.]&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;COS:&lt;/b&gt; Hopefully this brief account of why we do some of the things we do at BYU will increase both understanding of and appreciation for the opportunities and responsibilities we have as members of the Brigham Young University community. We wish we could share many more examples, and we encourage you to think of those you have observed that have contributed so broadly.

BYU is a great institution established by the Lord’s prophets to fulfill sacred purposes. It is prospered under the hand of heaven. We can never adequately express our appreciation for being associated with BYU and hope you sense the same feeling.

We know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. We, like you, feel honored and blessed to have the privilege of being involved in this great work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p><b>SGS:</b> Good morning! We add our voice of welcome to all of you at the beginning of a new year and new winter semester. While it is chilly outside, you exude a warmth that is both pleasant and encouraging. We join you in looking forward to an exciting and productive experience as we push forward to make 2014 one of our best years ever.</p>
<p>Two years ago, in the devotional that began the 2012 winter semester, we spoke to the theme of things that we appreciate most about BYU. Some may recall that we mentioned our Mission and Aims statements, our Honor Code, and our opportunities to attend devotionals and to speak freely about our faith and testimonies. We do not plan to repeat that message today but have chosen to discuss a similar, but different, topic: the reason we do some of the things we do at BYU. We intend our focus to reach far beyond the local culture and environment that we on campus experience and enjoy.</p>
<p><b>COS:</b> In the October 1999 general conference priesthood session, President Gordon B. Hinckley, then our prophet and chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees, gave an interesting address concerning some of the things our sponsoring Church does and why they are done. At that time Sharon and I were not at BYU and had absolutely no inkling that I would have the assignment that has occupied us these last several years. Because he was the president of the Church and also because I occasionally wondered about some of these things myself, I was particularly interested in the matters he might choose to address in the limited time remaining in that great priesthood gathering.</p>
<p>Before speaking to any specific topics, President Hinckley’s prefatory comments included the following:</p>
<p><i>Our great mission is to testify of</i> [Jesus Christ’s] <i>living reality. We should not be involved with anything not in harmony with this major objective. We should be involved with whatever is in harmony with this objective. </i>[“Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,” <i>Ensign, </i>November 1999, 52]</p>
<p>He then went on to address this question: Why does the Church sponsor BYU? (See “Why We Do,” 52.)</p>
<p>We wish our time this morning would allow us to repeat all he said on that occasion. His impressive message is widely available electronically and in print, and I commend its careful reading and study to all who have an interest in this great institution of BYU specifically and in Church education generally.</p>
<p>President Hinckley began by declaring that the Church’s support for education has a doctrinal root in the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> Then he quoted these important verses from Doctrine and Covenants 88:78–80:</p>
<p><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i></p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms—</i></p>
<p><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i></p>
<p><b>COS:</b> President Hinckley lamented that because of the great expense related to BYU and other Church educational efforts, it is not possible to serve all those who would like and deserve this great learning experience. He said the Church would try to make it available to as many as possible through BYU, our other schools, institutes of religion, and seminaries. He mentioned how grateful all who are here should be as well as his disappointment with the occasional person who complains or does not seem to appreciate the unique opportunity to be at BYU.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> President Hinckley then went on to say the following:</p>
<p><i>Moreover, the university has brought much favorable notice to the Church. Its sponsoring organization, the Church, is widely recognized. It has become known for standards and ideals which have been written about and talked about and which have let the world know of those things in which we believe. Its academic programs and its athletic programs have both brought honor to the university and the Church. And as generations of students move through its halls and on to graduation and then out across the world, they will bring honor to their alma mater and its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. </i>[“Why We Do,” 52–53]</p>
<p><b>COS:</b> President Hinckley made further comments and assurances about BYU and Church education generally before moving on to other important topics, but it is very clear how our prophet leaders think about BYU. We feel it appropriate that we should express some pleasure and comfort about this remarkable support and reassurance, but we also hope all at BYU feel the tremendous responsibility this entails for everyone so associated with Brigham Young University. With that heavy but blessed burden in mind, let us now delve into a few of the reasons that we at BYU do some of the things we do.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> First, let us mention you students. After all, it would be a very difficult proposition to make the case for having a university without students. We are aware that at some places and at some times, it may seem to those studying that they are viewed as a necessary nuisance rather than a fundamental reason for the establishment of a university. Should that ever be the case, please read and carefully consider those verses from section 88 that President Hinckley quoted and that we have repeated today. For BYU to be the best it can be, the students who study here and represent the university in so many ways must also strive to be the best they can be.</p>
<p><b>COS:</b> All of you students have been very carefully selected. Your excellence in academic achievement and potential are widely understood—and at least as important in our admissions considerations is your “fit” for BYU, meaning your willingness and capacity to meet and follow the mission and aims of a BYU education. Our Honor Code, our commitment to service to others, and striving to be spiritually strengthened go hand in hand—all being essential for successful students at BYU. It is this inspired combination of values and attributes that reflect the now widely recognized ability of BYU graduates to serve their families, churches, communities, and nations with such effectiveness and remarkable contributions. You who come here are not perfect, nor is the admissions process perfect, nor anyone or anything else at BYU, but hopefully you and others will understand the breadth of prayerful consideration that goes into our admissions decisions and also the sadness we feel that we cannot accommodate more who would like to come and who could grow and contribute.</p>
<p>Second, we work very hard at continually striving to improve the quality of the university in both broad and narrow ways. In many respects, the measure of a great university is found in the caliber and attributes of its faculty. BYU has always been blessed with a devoted and committed faculty. Over our history from humble beginnings, we have had a gradual but significant strengthening of our faculty in all of its dimensions. In virtually every discipline in which we are engaged, we now have professors and colleagues who have achieved broad distinction in their endeavors while keeping their primary focus on our tremendous students. Our mentoring efforts and successes, for example, have led to national leadership among universities in placing our graduates in the most outstanding graduate and professional education programs in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> Third, we have the responsibility to become a light unto the world wherever we can. President Hinckley mentioned both our academics and athletics. In each of these areas, and in others as well, we have continued to advance, and, had we time today, we could list for you many successes and much recognition that have continued to bring acclaim to both BYU and our sponsoring Church.</p>
<p>By now I am sure that some of you wonder if we think our primary responsibility at BYU is to brag. Let us defend ourselves a little by sharing just two bits of homespun philosophy you may or may not recognize. First, someone once said, “If you done it, it ain’t bragging.” Second, Ann Landers, the former queen of etiquette, in a newspaper column said, “Bragging is not an attractive trait, but let us be honest. A man who catches a big fish does not go home through an alley” (Ann Landers nugget of the day, 20 January 1989).</p>
<p><b>COS:</b> We fully realize the potential conflict or confusion between what Jesus said about “let[ting] your light so shine” (Matthew 5:16) and keeping your “candle . . . under a bushel” (Matthew 5:15). Our purpose today is to be clear about why we do some of the things we do at BYU and the potential impact for good that these things have not only for the Church but also for the university and for others as well.</p>
<p>Although there are many examples supporting the premise that we must share what we do at BYU as well as render service broadly, time allows us only a brief glimpse at a few matters. Most would be aware that we have frequent visits to campus from people of prominence who represent the best of many cultures, professions, and peoples. We invite them because of what they can teach us and help us better understand about the world around us, but we also are anxious to host them on campus because of what it is they may learn and better understand about who and what we are. Our students have the regular privilege of hearing these distinguished visitors in addresses and classroom discussions.</p>
<p>We also host conferences that have gained wide recognition and appeal. Just one example would be the Law and Religion Symposium that is jointly sponsored by the J. Reuben Clark Law School and our supporting Church. Here we bring distinguished legal scholars and governmental leaders who share our concerns about the importance of religious liberty throughout the world. As with many of our impressive visitors, a number of them might find it awkward to respond to an invitation to visit our Church leaders alone but feel it quite natural to come to a renowned university of quality to participate in significant learning, teaching, and sharing. This would not be possible if Brigham Young University did not have a reputation as a fine and serious academic institution.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> BYU also has a tradition of solid outreach throughout the world. For many years we have had the opportunity to send volunteer teachers to China, for example, to teach English and increase appreciation for Western thought and cooperation. Our nursing students and faculty, our engineering students and faculty, and several of our outstanding performing groups have increased friendships and cooperation all around the globe. All of these things are expensive, and all are opportunities that bring friendship, gratitude, and recognition to and an understanding of BYU and our sponsoring Church.</p>
<p>Likewise, we regularly have some remarkable events on campus that have a major impact locally and afar. Currently the BYU Museum of Art is hosting the <i>Sacred Gifts</i> exhibit, which displays some of the finest religious artwork of Carl Bloch, Heinrich Hofmann, and Frans Schwartz. Most of these pieces are on loan to BYU from Denmark, Sweden, and the Riverside Church in New York City. Our friends in Europe have allowed them to come because of the respect and trust enjoyed there by BYU and its museum of art. These paintings have never left Denmark before and likely never will again. We hope you will take the opportunity to see these wonderful masterpieces.</p>
<p><b>COS:</b> Over the decade we have been at BYU, both at home and as we have traveled, we have had many personal experiences that emphasize and clarify the point Sharon has just made. My dear, why don’t you tell our friends about the remarkable trip we took to Rome, Italy, with Noel and Sydney Reynolds and Christian Heal soon after we arrived at BYU in 2003?</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> Although we had been to Rome a couple of times before, we were very excited to have a unique experience with these colleagues because we had been invited to the Vatican Library by Catholic leaders to discuss a cooperative venture regarding the preservation and translation of ancient Syriac texts that the Vatican Library possesses. We were treated cordially and respectfully as details of our continued cooperation with the library were discussed. Never before had we understood to this degree how important the substantial and serious scholarship going on at BYU is in making friends and having a positive influence for the university and the Church throughout the world. We are pleased that this special project continues and also several others that could equally be mentioned. Even though most of our students might not be fully aware of such activities, they are extremely important and valuable in the broader work and initiatives of Brigham Young University.</p>
<p><b>COS:</b> For many years the Division of Continuing Education at BYU has blessed thousands of lives by providing courses and instruction, increasingly online, for those living far from campus.</p>
<p>As another example, an increasingly significant part of our educational outreach activities is found in the various venues of BYU Broadcasting. Through the combined efforts of BYUtv, KBYU, BYU Radio, BYUtv International, and our 24/7 Internet streaming around the world, we are reaching millions of people. In the United States alone BYUtv is now in about 50 million households. In 2009 BYUtv was found in only one Nielsen rating measurable market. In 2013 that figure had risen to forty-six of the major markets in the USA.</p>
<p>Before we say more about what we are doing with BYU Broadcasting, let us return to the words of President Hinckley in the 1999 address we mentioned at the beginning of our remarks today. As he spoke of our sponsoring Church, President Hinckley reminded us that “it is concerned primarily with worship of the Lord Jesus Christ” (“Why We Do,” 52). Therefore, all that we do ultimately must be in harmony with that key objective and responsibility. That is why in 2009 our BYU Broadcasting efforts adopted the slogan of “Seeing the Good in the World.” When you read the words of the Savior in Matthew 5, you will see the roots of that phrasing.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> Now, how is that to be accomplished? Many of you know that I am an avid BYU sports fan. While we both attend as many sporting events, lectures, and musical and dramatic presentations as we can, we are extremely grateful that we can follow many of these events on BYUtv when we cannot personally be in attendance. In this we are not unique. We know of those who have tuned into one of our television or radio stations to watch or listen to a sporting event and have stayed tuned to other programming because they really do want to “see the good in the world.”</p>
<p>Programs like <i>Granite Flats, Studio C, American Ride, The Story Trek, </i>and others have a large following among our BYU and Church communities, but they have also attracted many not of our faith because of the wholesome quality of these programs. Let’s listen to what a few have had to say about their BYUtv experiences.</p>
<p><b>[Some short video clips were shown.]</b></p>
<p><b>COS:</b> Several years ago the Church Missionary Department developed a strategy that we have borrowed and refined at BYUtv. While surveys of various kinds have demonstrated that people describe their desire for the increased availability of wholesome and educational television programming, it is clear from viewing patterns that the primary motivation for choosing a particular program or event is to be entertained. Thus you see in our programming that we do seek to have high-quality entertainment that is uplifting and clean but also that tends first to engage and then enlighten the viewers. It is common for people to become aware of our devotionals, general conference sessions, and Mormon Tabernacle Choir broadcasts, as well as scripture roundtables and other Church-sponsored events, while simply, at least initially, seeking just to be entertained.</p>
<p><b>SGS:</b> Likewise, many good people have been introduced to wonderful, uplifting programming attractive to people of many faiths by shows such as <i>Fires of Faith, Silent Night, </i>and the upcoming production on Handel’s <i>Messiah</i> that will premiere later this year. Let’s view just a couple of brief clips from these programs that have gained national acclaim and attention.</p>
<p><b>[Some short video clips were shown.]</b></p>
<p><b>COS:</b> Hopefully this brief account of why we do some of the things we do at BYU will increase both understanding of and appreciation for the opportunities and responsibilities we have as members of the Brigham Young University community. We wish we could share many more examples, and we encourage you to think of those you have observed that have contributed so broadly.</p>
<p>BYU is a great institution established by the Lord’s prophets to fulfill sacred purposes. It is prospered under the hand of heaven. We can never adequately express our appreciation for being associated with BYU and hope you sense the same feeling.</p>
<p>We know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. We, like you, feel honored and blessed to have the privilege of being involved in this great work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
