  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Graduates and all who rejoice with you on this occasion: I enjoy commencement exercises. These are happy times for graduates, for parents, for friends, for teachers, and for administration. These are times to acknowledge past accomplishments and take proud notice of goals attained. These are also times to take notice of potentials certified and to anticipate future achievements.

Commencement exercises are also occasions to celebrate graduates’ progress from one status to another. That is what “commencement” signifies. It is a rite of passage, like a christening, a baptism, or a wedding reception. I am pleased to join in such a happy occasion.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Custom decrees that we dress up in robes for a commencement exercise and that graduates parade before the assembly to hear the reading of their names and to receive well-earned congratulations.

Custom also decrees that you receive ­written evidence of your new status—a diploma. Here I deviate from normal commencement rhetoric by calling attention to some embarrassing moments BYU has suffered in the preparation of these diplomas.

A minor example was reported in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Universe&lt;/i&gt; seventeen years ago. Every student who received a master’s degree in the April commencement in 1995 received a diploma in which the seal of the university contained the wrong date for its founding (see “Defective Y Diplomas Discovered, Replaced,” &lt;i&gt;Daily Universe,&lt;/i&gt; 20 September 1995, 1). Replacements were, of course, provided.

The report of that mistake, which I found in my files as I did research for this talk, reminded me of an even greater embarrassment that occurred during my own time as president of BYU. This one has never been reported, but since nearly forty years have now passed and since I do not want to continue selfishly concealing my unique knowledge of this matter, I choose to share it now.

In April 1974, BYU conferred an honorary degree on our beloved apostle Elder LeGrand Richards. Honorary degrees are titled by the awarding institution. Most frequently they are titled Doctor of Laws. In a creative moment, our BYU administration and board of trustees decided to give a unique title to Elder Richards’ degree: Doctor of Christian Service. The diploma was prepared and put into my hands, suitably framed in a presentation folder. With loving formality I presented it to Elder Richards in the commencement exercise.

As we took our seats, Elder Richards opened the folder and examined the diploma, which I had neglected to do. As the program went forward, he quietly handed me the opened folder and I read the beautifully inscribed degree: Doctor of Christian Science. Typical of that great gentleman, he never said anything about this embarrassing mistake. As for me, I quietly retained possession of the erroneous document, and we soon provided the correct one. Perhaps we will now have to endure the publicity we avoided in 1974, but I suppose we are now more suited to do so.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;II.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Custom also decrees that, as part of a graduation ceremony, graduates listen to speeches acknowledging the obvious fact that the mere gaining of knowledge and skill is only a partial view of the significance of education. Of even greater importance is how educational attainments will be used. As a result, commencement addresses commonly give graduates advice and take notice of the needs of the world in which they will serve.

You graduate in challenging times. We live in times of wars and rumors of wars, earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, recession, and the prospect of further financial disaster. Values and standards honored for thousands of years are being denied or cast aside. Evil is being called good, and good is being called evil. Selfishness is rampantly replacing service.

Though men’s hearts are failing them, you should take heart. There have always been challenging times. We, the generations of your predecessors, have survived daunting challenges, and so will you. The answer to all of these challenges is the same as it has always been. We have a Savior, and He has taught us what we should do. At the end of His ministry He declared: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).

As His witness I testify that His teachings are true and that the way He has marked out is the way to peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;III.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, what is your role in all of this?

Almost forty years ago President Marion G. Romney stood at this pulpit and spoke these words to graduates at a BYU commencement exercise:

&lt;i&gt;You all have a mark upon you after today. . . . You will be known as a graduate of Brigham Young University,&lt;/i&gt; [which is] &lt;i&gt;part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The people who know you and see you will judge the Church by you. Your great mission is to hold the banner high.&lt;/i&gt; [“Concluding Remarks,” BYU commencement address, 20 April 1973, 1]

You “have a mark upon you.” We all have marks or labels upon us. Our names and many characteristics of our appearance, such as family similarities, are marks. So is our speech. These marks are involuntary. Other marks are voluntarily assumed, like religious symbols that various faiths use on their apparel, which we honor, and tattoos, which we discourage. Our Savior is the model for a self-imposed mark of the utmost significance. Isaiah spoke messianically as he voiced the Savior’s declaration: “I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands” (Isaiah 49:16). In their own ways, each of these marks—holy and mundane—is a ­banner that sends a signal.

The mark you receive as a BYU graduate is neither involuntary nor self-imposed. You sought this mark, and it is put upon you by proper authority. After today you have more than a new line on your résumé. You have been marked. As a BYU graduate, you are, as we say, a marked man or woman.

The significance of a mark is twofold. First, like a banner, it will be visible and it will have an effect on others. “He” or “she” is a BYU graduate, some will say, and that statement will identify expectations or disappointment.

But the most important effect of the mark put upon you today is not the signal it sends to others but the influence it should have upon you. A mark can and should be a reminder of our relationship to those who put the mark upon us and also of the responsibilities we have assumed as a result of the certifications they have given us. These are the meanings probably intended when the apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians about their responsibilities as followers of Christ and concluded with his personal testimony that “I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus” (Galatians 6:17).

Paul’s marks may have been scars from persecution suffered in the service of the Master. Your marks from BYU may be academic to others, but to you the mark of a BYU degree should be a continuing reminder.

Foremost among the things you should remember from your years at BYU are the teachings you have received about the things of eternity and the principles of right and wrong that have been up-front in your religion classes and pervasive in many others. I will remind you of some of these teachings and do so in an unusual way. At Brigham Young University it seems appropriate to quote the teachings of the founder, Brigham Young. He spoke as an extraordinarily wise leader, and he also spoke as a prophet.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;IV.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Here are some of Brigham Young’s wise words about practical living:

&lt;i&gt;Some think too much, and should labor more, others labor too much and should think more, and thus maintain an equilibrium between the mental and physical members of the individual; then you will enjoy health and vigor, will be active, and ready to discern truly, and judge quickly.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 261]

&lt;i&gt;There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven. Sweet harmonious sounds give exquisite joy to human beings capable of appreciating music. . . . Every sweet musical sound that can be made belongs to the Saints and is for the Saints.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt;242–43]

Brigham Young was an aggressive teacher of self-reliance. Here are some of his words on that subject:

&lt;i&gt;Instead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us, let us inquire what we can do for ourselves.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 293]

&lt;i&gt;While we can help ourselves, it is our duty to do so.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 155]

&lt;i&gt;Have I any good reason to say to my Father in Heaven, “Fight my battles,” when he has given me the sword to wield, the arm and the brain that I can fight for myself? Can I ask him to fight my battles and sit quietly down waiting for him to do so? I cannot. . . . To ask God to do for me that which I can do for myself is preposterous to my mind.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 426]

&lt;i&gt;Ye Latter-day Saints, . . . learn to do without that which you cannot purchase and pay for; . . . you must and will live within your means.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 293]

Beyond Brigham Young’s wisdom—so ­necessary to lead the Saints in ­supporting themselves and in building their homes and society in a barren wilderness—he was foremost a prophet of God. He taught eternal truths and guided the Saints to apply them in their mortal circumstances.

&lt;i&gt;Our existence here is for the sole purpose of exaltation and restoration to the presence of our Father and God, where we may progress endlessly.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 37]

&lt;i&gt;The Gospel brings intelligence, happiness, and glory to all who obey it and live according to its precepts.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 53]

&lt;i&gt;The Lord has revealed to us a plan by which we may be saved both here and hereafter. God has done everything we could ask, and more. . . . The errand of Jesus to earth was to bring his brethren and sisters back into the presence of the Father; he has done his part of the work, and it remains for us to do ours. . . . He is now King of kings and Lord of lords, and the time will come when every knee will bow and every tongue confess, to the glory of God the Father, that Jesus is the Christ&lt;/i&gt;. [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 27]

In establishing the Academy that was to grow into Brigham Young University, this great founder taught that education was an imperative in the gospel of Jesus Christ.

&lt;i&gt;All our educational pursuits are in the service of God, for all these labors are to establish truth on the earth, and that we may increase in knowledge, wisdom, understanding in the power of faith and in the wisdom of God, that we may become fit subjects to dwell in a higher state of existence and intelligence than we now enjoy.&lt;/i&gt; [“Remarks by President Brigham Young” (6 October 1870), &lt;i&gt;Deseret News,&lt;/i&gt; Semi-Weekly, 25 October 1870, 2; quoted in&lt;i&gt;Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1997), 317]

&lt;i&gt;Man is organized and brought forth as the king of the earth, to understand, to criticize, examine, improve, manufacture, arrange, and organize the crude matter, and honor and glorify the work of God’s hands. . . . It is good for mortals to search out the things of this earth.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 49–50]

Brigham Young also taught that we have a responsibility to search out the things of God. And, typical of his philosophy of self-reliance, he taught that we have a duty to know these eternal truths for ourselves.

&lt;i&gt;I do not want men to come to me or my brethren for testimony as to the truth of this work; but let them take the Scriptures of divine truth, and there the path is pointed out to them as plainly as ever a guideboard indicated the right path to the weary traveler. There they are directed to go, not to . . . any Apostle or Elder in Israel, but to the Father in the name of Jesus, and ask for the information they need. Can they who take this course in honesty and sincerity receive information? Will the Lord turn away from the honest heart seeking for truth? No, he will not; he will prove to them, by the revelations of his Spirit.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 429–30]

Here is what Brigham Young said about this responsibility of personal revelation:

&lt;i&gt;How are we to know the voice of the Good Shepherd from the voice of a stranger? Can any person answer this question? I can. It is very easy. To every philosopher upon the earth, I say, your eye can be deceived, so can mine; your ear can be deceived, so can mine; . . . but the Spirit of God filling the creature with revelation and the light of eternity, cannot be mistaken—the revelation which comes from God is never mistaken. When an individual, filled with the Spirit of God, declares the truth of heaven, the sheep hear that, the Spirit of the Lord pierces their inmost souls . . . and they see and understand for themselves.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 431]

How was that individuality to be reconciled with the commandment to follow a prophet, even in the weighty exercise of authority ­necessary to settle the wilderness and hold back the world?

&lt;i&gt;The Lord Almighty leads this Church, and he will never suffer you to be led astray if you are found doing your duty. . . . If&lt;/i&gt; [your leaders] &lt;i&gt;should try to&lt;/i&gt; [lead you astray] &lt;i&gt;the Lord would quickly sweep them from the earth.&lt;/i&gt; [DBY, 137]

The next teaching I will quote is reminiscent of the Master’s teaching that man cannot serve two masters (see Matthew 6:24). In teaching the Saints how to conduct their lives in harmony with the gospel in a world that pursues other values, Brigham Young said:

&lt;i&gt;The man or woman who enjoys the spirit of our religion has no trials; but the man or woman who tries to live according to the Gospel of the Son of God, and at the same time clings to the spirit of the world, has trials and sorrows acute and keen, and that, too, continually.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 348]

As BYU graduates and other Saints suffer worldly criticism and perhaps even persecution, they will do well to remember Brigham Young’s declaration:

&lt;i&gt;Every time they persecute and try to overcome this people, they elevate us, weaken their own hands, and strengthen the hands and arms of this people. And every time they undertake to lessen our number, they increase it. And when they try to destroy the faith and virtue of this people, the Lord strengthens the feeble knees, and confirms the wavering in faith and power in God, in light, and intelligence.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 351]

Finally, Brigham Young had an inclusive attitude toward his fellowmen that all should understand and emulate:

&lt;i&gt;It has never altered my feelings towards individuals, as men or as women, whether they believe as I do or not. Can you live as neighbors with me? I can with you; and it is no particular concern of mine whether you believe with me or not.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 278–79]

&lt;i&gt;Our religion is adapted to the capacity of the whole human family. It does not send a portion of the people to howl in torment for ever and ever, but it reaches after the last son and daughter of Adam and Eve, and will pluck them from the prison, unlock the doors, and burst the bonds and bring forth every soul who will receive salvation.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY,&lt;/i&gt; 389]

These are some of the teachings of the great founder of this university. These are the ideals for which it still stands. I testify to you that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that He stands at the head of the church that sponsors this institution. And as His servant I invoke His blessings upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Graduates and all who rejoice with you on this occasion: I enjoy commencement exercises. These are happy times for graduates, for parents, for friends, for teachers, and for administration. These are times to acknowledge past accomplishments and take proud notice of goals attained. These are also times to take notice of potentials certified and to anticipate future achievements.</p>
<p>Commencement exercises are also occasions to celebrate graduates’ progress from one status to another. That is what “commencement” signifies. It is a rite of passage, like a christening, a baptism, or a wedding reception. I am pleased to join in such a happy occasion.</p>
<h2><b>I.</b></h2>
<p>Custom decrees that we dress up in robes for a commencement exercise and that graduates parade before the assembly to hear the reading of their names and to receive well-earned congratulations.</p>
<p>Custom also decrees that you receive ­written evidence of your new status—a diploma. Here I deviate from normal commencement rhetoric by calling attention to some embarrassing moments BYU has suffered in the preparation of these diplomas.</p>
<p>A minor example was reported in the <i>Daily Universe</i> seventeen years ago. Every student who received a master’s degree in the April commencement in 1995 received a diploma in which the seal of the university contained the wrong date for its founding (see “Defective Y Diplomas Discovered, Replaced,” <i>Daily Universe,</i> 20 September 1995, 1). Replacements were, of course, provided.</p>
<p>The report of that mistake, which I found in my files as I did research for this talk, reminded me of an even greater embarrassment that occurred during my own time as president of BYU. This one has never been reported, but since nearly forty years have now passed and since I do not want to continue selfishly concealing my unique knowledge of this matter, I choose to share it now.</p>
<p>In April 1974, BYU conferred an honorary degree on our beloved apostle Elder LeGrand Richards. Honorary degrees are titled by the awarding institution. Most frequently they are titled Doctor of Laws. In a creative moment, our BYU administration and board of trustees decided to give a unique title to Elder Richards’ degree: Doctor of Christian Service. The diploma was prepared and put into my hands, suitably framed in a presentation folder. With loving formality I presented it to Elder Richards in the commencement exercise.</p>
<p>As we took our seats, Elder Richards opened the folder and examined the diploma, which I had neglected to do. As the program went forward, he quietly handed me the opened folder and I read the beautifully inscribed degree: Doctor of Christian Science. Typical of that great gentleman, he never said anything about this embarrassing mistake. As for me, I quietly retained possession of the erroneous document, and we soon provided the correct one. Perhaps we will now have to endure the publicity we avoided in 1974, but I suppose we are now more suited to do so.</p>
<h2><b>II.</b></h2>
<p>Custom also decrees that, as part of a graduation ceremony, graduates listen to speeches acknowledging the obvious fact that the mere gaining of knowledge and skill is only a partial view of the significance of education. Of even greater importance is how educational attainments will be used. As a result, commencement addresses commonly give graduates advice and take notice of the needs of the world in which they will serve.</p>
<p>You graduate in challenging times. We live in times of wars and rumors of wars, earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, recession, and the prospect of further financial disaster. Values and standards honored for thousands of years are being denied or cast aside. Evil is being called good, and good is being called evil. Selfishness is rampantly replacing service.</p>
<p>Though men’s hearts are failing them, you should take heart. There have always been challenging times. We, the generations of your predecessors, have survived daunting challenges, and so will you. The answer to all of these challenges is the same as it has always been. We have a Savior, and He has taught us what we should do. At the end of His ministry He declared: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).</p>
<p>As His witness I testify that His teachings are true and that the way He has marked out is the way to peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come.</p>
<h2><b>III.</b></h2>
<p>Now, what is your role in all of this?</p>
<p>Almost forty years ago President Marion G. Romney stood at this pulpit and spoke these words to graduates at a BYU commencement exercise:</p>
<p><i>You all have a mark upon you after today. . . . You will be known as a graduate of Brigham Young University,</i> [which is] <i>part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The people who know you and see you will judge the Church by you. Your great mission is to hold the banner high.</i> [“Concluding Remarks,” BYU commencement address, 20 April 1973, 1]</p>
<p>You “have a mark upon you.” We all have marks or labels upon us. Our names and many characteristics of our appearance, such as family similarities, are marks. So is our speech. These marks are involuntary. Other marks are voluntarily assumed, like religious symbols that various faiths use on their apparel, which we honor, and tattoos, which we discourage. Our Savior is the model for a self-imposed mark of the utmost significance. Isaiah spoke messianically as he voiced the Savior’s declaration: “I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands” (Isaiah 49:16). In their own ways, each of these marks—holy and mundane—is a ­banner that sends a signal.</p>
<p>The mark you receive as a BYU graduate is neither involuntary nor self-imposed. You sought this mark, and it is put upon you by proper authority. After today you have more than a new line on your résumé. You have been marked. As a BYU graduate, you are, as we say, a marked man or woman.</p>
<p>The significance of a mark is twofold. First, like a banner, it will be visible and it will have an effect on others. “He” or “she” is a BYU graduate, some will say, and that statement will identify expectations or disappointment.</p>
<p>But the most important effect of the mark put upon you today is not the signal it sends to others but the influence it should have upon you. A mark can and should be a reminder of our relationship to those who put the mark upon us and also of the responsibilities we have assumed as a result of the certifications they have given us. These are the meanings probably intended when the apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians about their responsibilities as followers of Christ and concluded with his personal testimony that “I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus” (Galatians 6:17).</p>
<p>Paul’s marks may have been scars from persecution suffered in the service of the Master. Your marks from BYU may be academic to others, but to you the mark of a BYU degree should be a continuing reminder.</p>
<p>Foremost among the things you should remember from your years at BYU are the teachings you have received about the things of eternity and the principles of right and wrong that have been up-front in your religion classes and pervasive in many others. I will remind you of some of these teachings and do so in an unusual way. At Brigham Young University it seems appropriate to quote the teachings of the founder, Brigham Young. He spoke as an extraordinarily wise leader, and he also spoke as a prophet.</p>
<h2><b>IV.</b></h2>
<p>Here are some of Brigham Young’s wise words about practical living:</p>
<p><i>Some think too much, and should labor more, others labor too much and should think more, and thus maintain an equilibrium between the mental and physical members of the individual; then you will enjoy health and vigor, will be active, and ready to discern truly, and judge quickly.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 261]</p>
<p><i>There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven. Sweet harmonious sounds give exquisite joy to human beings capable of appreciating music. . . . Every sweet musical sound that can be made belongs to the Saints and is for the Saints.</i> [<i>DBY,</i>242–43]</p>
<p>Brigham Young was an aggressive teacher of self-reliance. Here are some of his words on that subject:</p>
<p><i>Instead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us, let us inquire what we can do for ourselves.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 293]</p>
<p><i>While we can help ourselves, it is our duty to do so.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 155]</p>
<p><i>Have I any good reason to say to my Father in Heaven, “Fight my battles,” when he has given me the sword to wield, the arm and the brain that I can fight for myself? Can I ask him to fight my battles and sit quietly down waiting for him to do so? I cannot. . . . To ask God to do for me that which I can do for myself is preposterous to my mind.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 426]</p>
<p><i>Ye Latter-day Saints, . . . learn to do without that which you cannot purchase and pay for; . . . you must and will live within your means.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 293]</p>
<p>Beyond Brigham Young’s wisdom—so ­necessary to lead the Saints in ­supporting themselves and in building their homes and society in a barren wilderness—he was foremost a prophet of God. He taught eternal truths and guided the Saints to apply them in their mortal circumstances.</p>
<p><i>Our existence here is for the sole purpose of exaltation and restoration to the presence of our Father and God, where we may progress endlessly.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 37]</p>
<p><i>The Gospel brings intelligence, happiness, and glory to all who obey it and live according to its precepts.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 53]</p>
<p><i>The Lord has revealed to us a plan by which we may be saved both here and hereafter. God has done everything we could ask, and more. . . . The errand of Jesus to earth was to bring his brethren and sisters back into the presence of the Father; he has done his part of the work, and it remains for us to do ours. . . . He is now King of kings and Lord of lords, and the time will come when every knee will bow and every tongue confess, to the glory of God the Father, that Jesus is the Christ</i>. [<i>DBY,</i> 27]</p>
<p>In establishing the Academy that was to grow into Brigham Young University, this great founder taught that education was an imperative in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i>All our educational pursuits are in the service of God, for all these labors are to establish truth on the earth, and that we may increase in knowledge, wisdom, understanding in the power of faith and in the wisdom of God, that we may become fit subjects to dwell in a higher state of existence and intelligence than we now enjoy.</i> [“Remarks by President Brigham Young” (6 October 1870), <i>Deseret News,</i> Semi-Weekly, 25 October 1870, 2; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1997), 317]</p>
<p><i>Man is organized and brought forth as the king of the earth, to understand, to criticize, examine, improve, manufacture, arrange, and organize the crude matter, and honor and glorify the work of God’s hands. . . . It is good for mortals to search out the things of this earth.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 49–50]</p>
<p>Brigham Young also taught that we have a responsibility to search out the things of God. And, typical of his philosophy of self-reliance, he taught that we have a duty to know these eternal truths for ourselves.</p>
<p><i>I do not want men to come to me or my brethren for testimony as to the truth of this work; but let them take the Scriptures of divine truth, and there the path is pointed out to them as plainly as ever a guideboard indicated the right path to the weary traveler. There they are directed to go, not to . . . any Apostle or Elder in Israel, but to the Father in the name of Jesus, and ask for the information they need. Can they who take this course in honesty and sincerity receive information? Will the Lord turn away from the honest heart seeking for truth? No, he will not; he will prove to them, by the revelations of his Spirit.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 429–30]</p>
<p>Here is what Brigham Young said about this responsibility of personal revelation:</p>
<p><i>How are we to know the voice of the Good Shepherd from the voice of a stranger? Can any person answer this question? I can. It is very easy. To every philosopher upon the earth, I say, your eye can be deceived, so can mine; your ear can be deceived, so can mine; . . . but the Spirit of God filling the creature with revelation and the light of eternity, cannot be mistaken—the revelation which comes from God is never mistaken. When an individual, filled with the Spirit of God, declares the truth of heaven, the sheep hear that, the Spirit of the Lord pierces their inmost souls . . . and they see and understand for themselves.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 431]</p>
<p>How was that individuality to be reconciled with the commandment to follow a prophet, even in the weighty exercise of authority ­necessary to settle the wilderness and hold back the world?</p>
<p><i>The Lord Almighty leads this Church, and he will never suffer you to be led astray if you are found doing your duty. . . . If</i> [your leaders] <i>should try to</i> [lead you astray] <i>the Lord would quickly sweep them from the earth.</i> [DBY, 137]</p>
<p>The next teaching I will quote is reminiscent of the Master’s teaching that man cannot serve two masters (see Matthew 6:24). In teaching the Saints how to conduct their lives in harmony with the gospel in a world that pursues other values, Brigham Young said:</p>
<p><i>The man or woman who enjoys the spirit of our religion has no trials; but the man or woman who tries to live according to the Gospel of the Son of God, and at the same time clings to the spirit of the world, has trials and sorrows acute and keen, and that, too, continually.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 348]</p>
<p>As BYU graduates and other Saints suffer worldly criticism and perhaps even persecution, they will do well to remember Brigham Young’s declaration:</p>
<p><i>Every time they persecute and try to overcome this people, they elevate us, weaken their own hands, and strengthen the hands and arms of this people. And every time they undertake to lessen our number, they increase it. And when they try to destroy the faith and virtue of this people, the Lord strengthens the feeble knees, and confirms the wavering in faith and power in God, in light, and intelligence.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 351]</p>
<p>Finally, Brigham Young had an inclusive attitude toward his fellowmen that all should understand and emulate:</p>
<p><i>It has never altered my feelings towards individuals, as men or as women, whether they believe as I do or not. Can you live as neighbors with me? I can with you; and it is no particular concern of mine whether you believe with me or not.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 278–79]</p>
<p><i>Our religion is adapted to the capacity of the whole human family. It does not send a portion of the people to howl in torment for ever and ever, but it reaches after the last son and daughter of Adam and Eve, and will pluck them from the prison, unlock the doors, and burst the bonds and bring forth every soul who will receive salvation.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 389]</p>
<p>These are some of the teachings of the great founder of this university. These are the ideals for which it still stands. I testify to you that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that He stands at the head of the church that sponsors this institution. And as His servant I invoke His blessings upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
