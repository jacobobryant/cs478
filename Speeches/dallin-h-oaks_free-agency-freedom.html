  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I appreciate this opportunity to participate in BYUs annual symposium on the Book of Mormon. This year you are focusing on the second book of Nephi. That book provides some of our most important doctrinal insights on the significance of free agency in the gospel plan. I have therefore chosen to speak about free agency and freedom.

The scriptural terms are &lt;i&gt;agency&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt;. When we refer to agency, we usually combine the two words and say &lt;i&gt;free agency.&lt;/i&gt; But we sometimes use this term to refer to freedom as well as agency. And the scriptural term &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; sometimes means free agency and sometimes means &lt;i&gt;freedom&lt;/i&gt;.

In view of this confusion, I need to define the terms I will use. When I say &lt;i&gt;free agency&lt;/i&gt; I refer to what scripture calls &lt;i&gt;agency,&lt;/i&gt; which means an exercise of the will, the power to choose. (In view of the current prominence of this term on the sports pages, I must add that this "free agency" does not refer to the contract status of professional athletes.) When I say &lt;i&gt;freedom,&lt;/i&gt; I mean the power and privilege to carry out our choices. This includes everything from thoughts, such as hate, to actions, such as running.

In the first part of my talk I will speak of the doctrine of the Church. In the second part I will describe some applications of that doctrine.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;I. Doctrine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Sister Oaks is my best critic. She tells me that when I speak about doctrine my talks are pretty dry, probably more understandable to read than to hear. Perhaps it would help listeners to this first part if I began with an outline of the nine points I will make from the scriptures.

1. Before the world was created, we existed in the presence of God.

2. Free agency is a gift of God.

3. We had free agency in the premortal existence.

4. There Satan presented a plan that would have taken away our free agency.

5. When God rejected Satans plan, Satan and those who followed him rebelled and were cast out of heaven.

6. Pursuant to Gods plan, Adam and Eve made the choice that caused the Fall, making mankind subject to mortality and sin in the world.

7. We are here to be tested, and this cannot occur without opposition in all things.

8. To provide that opposition, Satan is permitted to try to persuade us to use our free agency to choose evil.

9. If we choose evil and do not repent, we can ultimately become captives of Satan.

To appreciate the significance of the added gospel knowledge restored in this dispensation, notice how many of these essential gospel truths are revealed or clarified in the Book of Mormon, especially in 2 Nephi, and in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price.

1. &lt;i&gt;Before the world was created, we existed in the presence of God (see D&amp;amp;C 93:29). &lt;/i&gt;Abraham saw that God stood in the midst of these spirits and chose some of them to make his rulers (see Abraham 3:23). We do not know much about the premortal existence. The scriptures sometimes refer to preexistent "intelligences" and sometimes to preexistent "spirits" (see Moses 6:36; Abraham 3:1823, 5:7; D&amp;amp;C 93:2933.) For present purposes it is unnecessary to distinguish between the two. The important thing is that in the premortal existence we had individual identities and we dwelt in the presence of God.

2. &lt;i&gt;Free agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God.&lt;/i&gt; As we read in 2 Nephi: "Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself" (2 Nephi 2:16). Further:

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves - to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 10:23]

And in modern revelation the Lord said, "Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself" (D&amp;amp;C 29:35).

The Prophet Joseph Smith described agency as "that free independence of mind which heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human family as one of its choicest gifts" (&lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; p. 49). The word &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; is also used to describe free agency in this hymn Latter-day Saints have been singing since our first hymnbook in 1835:

&lt;i&gt;Know this, that evry soul is free&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To choose his life and what hell be;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For this eternal truth is givn:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That God will force no man to heavn.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hell call, persuade, direct aright,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And bless with wisdom, love, and light,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In nameless ways be good and kind,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But never force the human mind.&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 240]

3. &lt;i&gt;We had free agency in the premortal existence.&lt;/i&gt; This is evident from the fact that more than one plan was put forward in the Council in Heaven, and that a third of the hosts of heaven could choose to follow Satan and rebel against the Father. (See Joseph Fielding Smith, &lt;i&gt;Doctrines of Salvation,&lt;/i&gt; comp. Bruce R. McConkie [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 195456], 1:64, 70.)

4. &lt;i&gt;Satans plan, presented in the premortal existence, would have taken away our free agency.&lt;/i&gt; During what we call the Council in Heaven, the Father explained the conditions of the next step in the progression of his spirit children. They needed to receive a mortal body, and it was necessary for God to "prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).

Satan came before God with this proposal:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 4:1]

But the Beloved Son, our Savior, who was "Chosen from the beginning," said to the Father: "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27), and "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2).

In the book of Moses God describes Satans effort:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 4:34].

Satans method of assuring "that one soul shall not be lost" (Moses 4:1) would be to "destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). Under his plan, Satan would have been our master, and he would have led us "captive at his will" (Moses 4:4). Without the power of choice, we would have been mere robots or puppets in his hands.

&lt;i&gt;5. When God rejected Satans plan, Satan and those who followed him rebelled and were cast out of heaven.&lt;/i&gt;

The contest the scriptures call the "war in heaven" (Revelation 12:7) concerned Satans attempts to usurp the power of God and to destroy the free agency of his children. One-third of the hosts of heaven exercised their agency to follow Satan. The Bible describes this in veiled references to Lucifers attempt to exalt himself and to a war in which the dragon and his angels were cast out of heaven. (See Isaiah 14:1215, Revelation 12:79, Abraham 3:28.) The event is described more clearly in modern revelation:

&lt;i&gt;For &lt;/i&gt;[the devil] &lt;i&gt;rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 29: 3637; see also D&amp;amp;C 76:2526]

In his great poem "Immanuel," Orson F. Whitney describes this event in the council of gods when "The destiny of worlds unborn hung trembling in the scale." One arose:

&lt;i&gt;A stature mingling strength and grace,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Of meek though Godlike mien,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The luster of whose countenance&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Outshone the noon-day sheen.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The hair was white as purest foam,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Or frost of Alpine hill.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He spake - attention grew more grave - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The stillness een more still.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Father!" - the voice like music fell,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Clear as the murmuring flow&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Of mountain streamlet, trickling down&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;From heights of virgin snow - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Father!" it said, "since One must die&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thy children to redeem,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Whilst Earth - as yet unformed and void - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;With pulsing life shall teem;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"And thou, great Michael, foremost fall,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That mortal man may be,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And chosen Savior yet must send,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lo, here am I, send me!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I ask - I seek no recompense,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Save that which then were mine;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mine be the willing sacrifice,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The endless glory - Thine!"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He ceased and sat; when sudden rose&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Aloft a towering Form,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Proudly erect, as lowering peak&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That looms above the storm.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A presence bright and beautiful,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;With eye of flashing fire,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A lip whose haughty curl bespoke&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A sense of inward ire.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Give me to go," he boldly cried,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;With scarce concealed disdain,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"And none shall hence, from heaven to earth,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That shall not rise again.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;My saving plan exception scorns - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mans agency unknown.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As recompense, I claim the right&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To sit on yonder Throne!"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Resumed and denser grew.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;All eyes were turned; the general gaze&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;One common magnet drew.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A moment there was solemn pause - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Then, like the thunder-burst,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rolled forth from lips Omnipotent,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The words: "ILL SEND THE FIRST!"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Twas done. From congregation vast,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tumultuous murmurs rose;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Waves of conflicting sound, as when&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Two meeting seas oppose.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Twas finished - but the heavens wept - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And still their annals tell&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How Gods elect was chosen Christ,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oer One who fighting fell.&lt;/i&gt;
["Immanuel - A Christmas Idyl," &lt;i&gt;The Poetical Writings of Orson F. Whitney&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1889), pp. 136142]

&lt;i&gt;6. Pursuant to Gods plan, Adam and Eve made the choice that caused the Fall, making mankind subject to mortality and sin in the world.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it&lt;/i&gt; [the Lord told Adam and Eve], &lt;i&gt;nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 3:17]

Adam and Eve were able to bring about the Fall by choice because they had alternatives and they had free agency, whose essence is described in these words: "Thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).

Thus we see that what we call "the Fall" and the "transgression of Adam" was a necessary step that resulted from our first parents exercise of their gift of free agency. As we read in 2 Nephi, Lehi explained:

&lt;i&gt;But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 2:2425]

With the Fall came mortality and an opportunity to be tested. The Lord told Adam that his children were given "to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves" (Moses 6:56). Alma taught that with the Fall man became

&lt;i&gt;as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 12:31; also see Alma 42:7]

Similarly, the prophet Samuel taught:

&lt;i&gt;For behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 14:30]

Note that in this teaching the word "free" means free agency.

7. &lt;i&gt;We are here to be tested, and this cannot occur without opposition in all things.&lt;/i&gt;

On this subject 2 Nephi enlarges our understanding. Father Lehi taught his son Jacob:

&lt;i&gt;For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 2:11]

In other words, if we did not have opposition, we could not exercise our free agency by making choices. "Wherefore," Father Lehi explained, "the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other" (2 Nephi 2:16).

Without opposition in all things we could not achieve righteousness. All things would be a compound in one, a mixture - no distinction between wickedness and holiness. In that state of innocence, mankind would be "having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin" (2 Nephi 2:23). As we read in modern revelation,

&lt;i&gt;And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 29:39]

8. &lt;i&gt;To provide the needed opposition, Satan is permitted to try to persuade us to use our free agency to choose evil.&lt;/i&gt;

In 2 Nephi, Lehi declares that the Messiah will come "in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall" (2 Nephi 2:26). Then he gives us this important explanation:

&lt;i&gt;And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Nephi 2:2627]

"Free . . . to act for themselves" and "free to choose" refer to free agency. "Free according to the flesh" refers to freedom, as I will illustrate later.

9. &lt;i&gt;If we choose evil and do not repent, we can ultimately become captives of Satan.&lt;/i&gt;

Lehis assurance that we are free "to act for [ourselves] and not to be acted upon" has this exception: "save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day" if we have chosen "captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:2627). He then pleads with his sons not to

&lt;i&gt;choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.&lt;/i&gt; [vs. 29]

Similarly, Amulek taught:

&lt;i&gt;For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 34:35]

In summary, free agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God, conferred on his children and exercised by them in the premortal existence. It is an essential precondition of the further progression we seek in mortality. But free agency cannot be exercised unless there is opposition in all things. That opposition is provided by Satan, who once sought to destroy our free agency. His effort continues. He tries to persuade us to do evil, and to make those choices that will finally give him the mastery he was denied in the premortal existence - to have all power over us, to lead us captive at his will.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;II. Application&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now I will discuss some applications of these scriptural principles.

&lt;i&gt;First,&lt;/i&gt; because &lt;i&gt;free agency&lt;/i&gt; is a God-given precondition to the purpose of mortal life, no person or organization can take away our free agency in mortality.

&lt;i&gt;Second,&lt;/i&gt; what can be taken away or reduced by the conditions of mortality is our &lt;i&gt;freedom,&lt;/i&gt; the power to act upon our choices. Free agency is absolute, but in the circumstances of mortality freedom is always qualified.

Freedom may be qualified or taken away (1) by physical laws, including the physical limitations with which we are born, (2) by our own action, and (3) by the action of others, including governments.
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lehi taught his son Jacob that "men are free [have freedom] according to the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
flesh" (2 Nephi 2:27). For example, in the flesh we are subject to the physical law of gravity. If I should hang from the catwalk here in the Marriott Center and release my grip, I would not be free to will myself into a soft landing. And I cannot choose to run through a brick wall.

A loss of freedom reduces the extent to which we can act upon our choices, but it does not deprive us of our God-given free agency. A woman who has spent much of her life confined to a wheelchair expressed that thought in verse. Annie Johnson Flint writes:

&lt;i&gt;I cannot walk, but I can fly;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No roof can house me from the stars&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No dwelling pen me in its bounds,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nor keep me fast with locks and bars.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;No narrow room my thoughts can cage,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No fetters hold my roving mind;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;From these four walls that shut me in,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;My soaring soul a way can find. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when the long, long day is done,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I clasp the dearest book of all,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And through the dim, sweet silences,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I hear my Fathers accents fall.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then, though, in chains, yet I am free;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Beyond the pressure of my care,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Above earths night, my spirit mounts&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On eagle wings of Faith and Prayer.&lt;/i&gt;
["My Wings," Annie Johnson Flint]

2. Other limitations on freedom are self-imposed, such as the immobility we seek when we buckle our seat belt or the commitment we make when we sign a contract. In these examples we limit one freedom in order to achieve a larger and more important one.

3. Many losses of freedom are imposed by others. The science of government is a consideration of the procedures by which and the extent to which the official representatives of one group of citizens can impose restrictions on the freedom of another group. Decisions on the extent to which government power should restrict the freedom of individuals are among the most difficult decisions we face in an organized society. How much should zoning laws restrict a persons right to use his own property? How many taxes should we extract, and what compulsory functions should government perform with them? How much harm can society allow a person to do himself, such as by self-mutilation or drug use? These are all questions of freedom.

We have to accept some government limitations on freedom if we who live in communities are to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A condition of uninhibited individual freedom would allow the strong to oppress the weak. It would allow the eccentric desires of one person to restrict the freedom of many.

Interferences with our freedom do not deprive us of our free agency. When Pharaoh put Joseph in prison, he restricted Josephs freedom, but he did not take away his free agency. When Jesus drove the money changers out of the temple, he interfered with their freedom to engage in a particular activity at a particular time in a particular place, but he did not take away their free agency.

During my nine years at BYU I read many letters to the editor in the &lt;i&gt;Universe&lt;/i&gt; that protested various rules as infringements of free agency. I am glad I dont see those funny arguments anymore, probably because I no longer have to read the letters to the editor in the &lt;i&gt;Universe&lt;/i&gt;. The Lord has told us in modern revelation that he established the Constitution of the United States to assure "that every man may act . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him" (D&amp;amp;C 101:78). In other words, God established our Constitution to give us the vital political freedom necessary for us to act upon our personal choices in civil government. This revelation shows the distinction between &lt;i&gt;agency&lt;/i&gt; (the power of choice), which is God-given, and &lt;i&gt;freedom,&lt;/i&gt; the right to act upon our choices, which is protected by the Constitution and laws of the land.

Freedom is obviously of great importance, but as these examples illustrate, freedom is always qualified in mortality. Consequently, when we oppose a government-imposed loss of freedom, it would be better if we did not conduct our debate in terms of a loss of our free agency, which is impossible under our doctrine. We ought to focus on the legality or the wisdom of the proposed restriction of our freedom.

&lt;i&gt;Third,&lt;/i&gt; we receive assurance from our doctrine that Satan, who sought to take away our free agency in the premortal existence, is not permitted to take it from us in this life. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the devil cannot compel men to do evil; he has "power over us only as we permit him" (&lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; pp. 181, 187, 189). Elder James E. Faust elaborated this in our last conference, when he said, "Certainly he can tempt and he can deceive, but he has no authority over us which we do not give him" ("The Great Imitator," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; October 1987, p. 35).

&lt;i&gt;Fourth,&lt;/i&gt; as suggested by these teachings, Satan is still trying to take away our free agency by persuading us to voluntarily surrender our will to his.

This subject has a morbid fascination for mankind. The long-lived German legend of Faust concerns a man who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power. This is also the theme of Stephen Vincent Benets "The Devil and Daniel Webster." A variety of modern practices tend toward this surrender, and they carry eternal dangers. As Elder Faust warned us at conference,

&lt;i&gt;The mischief of devil worship, sorcery, casting spells, witchcraft, voodooism, black magic, and all other forms of demonism should be avoided like the plague.&lt;/i&gt; ["The Great Imitator," p. 33]

&lt;i&gt;Fifth,&lt;/i&gt; we should also avoid any practices in which one person attempts to surrender even part of his will to another person or in which another person attempts to take it. Whether the means are chemical, behavioral, electronic, or others not yet dreamed of, such attempts run counter to the heavenly plan and further the adversarys plan. Free agency, the power to choose and direct our thoughts and our actions, is a gift of God, and we should resist any means that would compromise it.

&lt;i&gt;Sixth,&lt;/i&gt; we should avoid any behavior that is addictive. Whatever is addictive compromises our will. Subjecting our will to the overbearing impulses imposed by any form of addiction serves Satans purposes and subverts our Heavenly Fathers. This applies to addictions to drugs (such as narcotics, alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine), addiction to practices such as gambling, and any other addictive behavior. We can avoid addictions by keeping the commandments of God.

&lt;i&gt;Seventh,&lt;/i&gt; we should be aware that some people are more susceptible to some addictions than other people. Perhaps such susceptibility is inborn, like the unnamed ailment the Apostle Paul called "a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure" (2 Corinthians 12:7). One person has a taste for nicotine and is easily addicted to smoking. Another person cannot take an occasional drink without being propelled into alcoholism. Another person samples gambling and becomes a compulsive gambler.

Perhaps these persons, as the saying goes, were "born that way." But what does this mean? Does it mean that persons with susceptibilities or strong tendencies have no choice, no free agency in these matters? Our doctrine teaches us otherwise. Regardless of a persons susceptibility or tendency, his will is unfettered. His free agency is unqualified. It is his freedom that is impaired. Other persons are more free; though they unwisely sample the temptations, they seem immune to the addiction. But regardless of the extent of our freedom, we are all responsible for the exercise of our free agency.

As Lehi taught, in mortality we are only free "according to the flesh" (2 Nephi 2:27). Most of us are born with thorns in the flesh - some more visible, some more serious than others. We all seem to have susceptibilities to one disorder or another, but whatever our susceptibilities, we have the will and the power to control our thoughts and our actions. This must be so. God has said that he holds us accountable for what we do and what we think, so these must be controllable by our agency. Once we have reached the age or condition of accountability, "I was born that way" does not excuse actions or thoughts that fail to conform to the commandments of God. We need to learn how to live so that a weakness that is mortal will not prevent us from achieving the goal that is eternal.

God has promised that he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain (see 2 Nephi 2:2). The efforts we expend in overcoming an inherited weakness build spiritual strength that will serve us throughout eternity. Thus, when Paul prayed thrice that his "thorn in the flesh" would depart from him, the Lord replied, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Obedient, Paul concluded,

&lt;i&gt;Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Corinthians 12:910]

Whatever our susceptibilities or tendencies, they cannot subject us to eternal consequences unless we exercise our free agency to do or think the things forbidden by the commandments of God. For example, a susceptibility to alcoholism impairs its victims freedom to partake without addiction, but his free agency allows him to abstain and thus escape the physical debilitation of alcohol and the spiritual deterioration of addiction.

&lt;i&gt;Eighth,&lt;/i&gt; beware the argument that because a person has strong drives toward a particular act that he has no power of choice and therefore no responsibility for his actions. This contention runs counter to the most fundamental premises of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Satan would like us to believe that we are not responsible in this life. That is the result he tried to achieve by his contest in the premortal existence. A person who insists that he is not responsible for the exercise of his free agency because he was "born that way" is trying to ignore the outcome of the War in Heaven. We are responsible, and if we argue otherwise, our efforts become part of the propaganda effort of the adversary.

Individual responsibility is a law of life. It applies in the law of man and the law of God. Society holds people responsible to control their impulses so we can live in a civilized society. God holds his children responsible to control their impulses so they can keep his commandments and realize their eternal destiny. The law does not excuse the short-tempered man who surrenders to his impulse to pull a trigger on his tormentor, or the greedy man who surrenders to his impulse to steal, or the pedophile who surrenders to his impulse to satisfy his sexual desires with children.

I suppose it is inevitable that those who have surrendered to impulse would try to use the defense of "irresistible impulse." But in the courts on high, this defense will be transparent to the Great Judge, who sees all our actions and "knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Alma 18:32).

There is much we do not know about the extent of freedom we have in view of the various thorns in the flesh that afflict us in mortality. But this much we do know, we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have our free agency, and God holds us accountable for the way we use it in thought and deed. That is fundamental.

God has commanded us not to become entangled in sin (see D&amp;amp;C 88:86). In modern revelation he said:

&lt;i&gt;And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 38:42]

This principle of individual responsibility and these commands to go out from among the wicked and to be clean apply to a multitude of circumstances. In terms of free agency and freedom, I urge you to apply these commands in this way: If you have a weakness or a susceptibility to some particular transgression, especially one that can be addictive, use your free agency and your freedom to steer a course far from the circumstances of that particular transgression.

May God bless us to live our lives so as to avoid entangling ourselves in sin and compromising our precious and unique gift of free agency. May we accept responsibility for our thoughts and our actions. May we use our free agency to make righteous choices and to act upon them as we have the freedom to do so.

For my conclusion I come back to the words of Nephi in the concluding chapter of 2 Nephi:

&lt;i&gt;I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people . . . .&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 33:3]

&lt;i&gt;And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth . . .&lt;/i&gt; .[v. 5]

&lt;i&gt;. . . And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good . . . .&lt;/i&gt; [v. 10]

&lt;i&gt;And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.&lt;/i&gt; [v. 12]

I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I appreciate this opportunity to participate in BYUs annual symposium on the Book of Mormon. This year you are focusing on the second book of Nephi. That book provides some of our most important doctrinal insights on the significance of free agency in the gospel plan. I have therefore chosen to speak about free agency and freedom.</p>
<p>The scriptural terms are <i>agency</i> and <i>free</i>. When we refer to agency, we usually combine the two words and say <i>free agency.</i> But we sometimes use this term to refer to freedom as well as agency. And the scriptural term <i>free</i> sometimes means free agency and sometimes means <i>freedom</i>.</p>
<p>In view of this confusion, I need to define the terms I will use. When I say <i>free agency</i> I refer to what scripture calls <i>agency,</i> which means an exercise of the will, the power to choose. (In view of the current prominence of this term on the sports pages, I must add that this "free agency" does not refer to the contract status of professional athletes.) When I say <i>freedom,</i> I mean the power and privilege to carry out our choices. This includes everything from thoughts, such as hate, to actions, such as running.</p>
<p>In the first part of my talk I will speak of the doctrine of the Church. In the second part I will describe some applications of that doctrine.</p>
<h2><b>I. Doctrine</b></h2>
<p>Sister Oaks is my best critic. She tells me that when I speak about doctrine my talks are pretty dry, probably more understandable to read than to hear. Perhaps it would help listeners to this first part if I began with an outline of the nine points I will make from the scriptures.</p>
<p>1. Before the world was created, we existed in the presence of God.</p>
<p>2. Free agency is a gift of God.</p>
<p>3. We had free agency in the premortal existence.</p>
<p>4. There Satan presented a plan that would have taken away our free agency.</p>
<p>5. When God rejected Satans plan, Satan and those who followed him rebelled and were cast out of heaven.</p>
<p>6. Pursuant to Gods plan, Adam and Eve made the choice that caused the Fall, making mankind subject to mortality and sin in the world.</p>
<p>7. We are here to be tested, and this cannot occur without opposition in all things.</p>
<p>8. To provide that opposition, Satan is permitted to try to persuade us to use our free agency to choose evil.</p>
<p>9. If we choose evil and do not repent, we can ultimately become captives of Satan.</p>
<p>To appreciate the significance of the added gospel knowledge restored in this dispensation, notice how many of these essential gospel truths are revealed or clarified in the Book of Mormon, especially in 2 Nephi, and in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price.</p>
<p>1. <i>Before the world was created, we existed in the presence of God (see D&amp;C 93:29). </i>Abraham saw that God stood in the midst of these spirits and chose some of them to make his rulers (see Abraham 3:23). We do not know much about the premortal existence. The scriptures sometimes refer to preexistent "intelligences" and sometimes to preexistent "spirits" (see Moses 6:36; Abraham 3:1823, 5:7; D&amp;C 93:2933.) For present purposes it is unnecessary to distinguish between the two. The important thing is that in the premortal existence we had individual identities and we dwelt in the presence of God.</p>
<p>2. <i>Free agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God.</i> As we read in 2 Nephi: "Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself" (2 Nephi 2:16). Further:</p>
<p><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves - to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.</i> [2 Nephi 10:23]</p>
<p>And in modern revelation the Lord said, "Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself" (D&amp;C 29:35).</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith described agency as "that free independence of mind which heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human family as one of its choicest gifts" (<i>Teachings,</i> p. 49). The word <i>free</i> is also used to describe free agency in this hymn Latter-day Saints have been singing since our first hymnbook in 1835:</p>
<p><i>Know this, that evry soul is free</i><br />
<i>To choose his life and what hell be;</i><br />
<i>For this eternal truth is givn:</i><br />
<i>That God will force no man to heavn.</i><br />
<i>Hell call, persuade, direct aright,</i></p>
<p><i>And bless with wisdom, love, and light,</i><br />
<i>In nameless ways be good and kind,</i><br />
<i>But never force the human mind.</i><br />
[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 240]</p>
<p>3. <i>We had free agency in the premortal existence.</i> This is evident from the fact that more than one plan was put forward in the Council in Heaven, and that a third of the hosts of heaven could choose to follow Satan and rebel against the Father. (See Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i> comp. Bruce R. McConkie [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 195456], 1:64, 70.)</p>
<p>4. <i>Satans plan, presented in the premortal existence, would have taken away our free agency.</i> During what we call the Council in Heaven, the Father explained the conditions of the next step in the progression of his spirit children. They needed to receive a mortal body, and it was necessary for God to "prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).</p>
<p>Satan came before God with this proposal:</p>
<p><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i> [Moses 4:1]</p>
<p>But the Beloved Son, our Savior, who was "Chosen from the beginning," said to the Father: "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27), and "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2).</p>
<p>In the book of Moses God describes Satans effort:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i></p>
<p><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i> [Moses 4:34].</p>
<p>Satans method of assuring "that one soul shall not be lost" (Moses 4:1) would be to "destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). Under his plan, Satan would have been our master, and he would have led us "captive at his will" (Moses 4:4). Without the power of choice, we would have been mere robots or puppets in his hands.</p>
<p><i>5. When God rejected Satans plan, Satan and those who followed him rebelled and were cast out of heaven.</i></p>
<p>The contest the scriptures call the "war in heaven" (Revelation 12:7) concerned Satans attempts to usurp the power of God and to destroy the free agency of his children. One-third of the hosts of heaven exercised their agency to follow Satan. The Bible describes this in veiled references to Lucifers attempt to exalt himself and to a war in which the dragon and his angels were cast out of heaven. (See Isaiah 14:1215, Revelation 12:79, Abraham 3:28.) The event is described more clearly in modern revelation:</p>
<p><i>For </i>[the devil] <i>rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;</i></p>
<p><i>And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels.</i> [D&amp;C 29: 3637; see also D&amp;C 76:2526]</p>
<p>In his great poem "Immanuel," Orson F. Whitney describes this event in the council of gods when "The destiny of worlds unborn hung trembling in the scale." One arose:</p>
<p><i>A stature mingling strength and grace,</i><br />
<i>Of meek though Godlike mien,</i><br />
<i>The luster of whose countenance</i><br />
<i>Outshone the noon-day sheen.</i></p>
<p><i>The hair was white as purest foam,</i><br />
<i>Or frost of Alpine hill.</i><br />
<i>He spake - attention grew more grave - </i><br />
<i>The stillness een more still.</i></p>
<p><i>"Father!" - the voice like music fell,</i><br />
<i>Clear as the murmuring flow</i><br />
<i>Of mountain streamlet, trickling down</i><br />
<i>From heights of virgin snow - </i></p>
<p><i>"Father!" it said, "since One must die</i><br />
<i>Thy children to redeem,</i><br />
<i>Whilst Earth - as yet unformed and void - </i><br />
<i>With pulsing life shall teem;</i></p>
<p><i>"And thou, great Michael, foremost fall,</i><br />
<i>That mortal man may be,</i><br />
<i>And chosen Savior yet must send,</i><br />
<i>Lo, here am I, send me!</i></p>
<p><i>I ask - I seek no recompense,</i><br />
<i>Save that which then were mine;</i><br />
<i>Mine be the willing sacrifice,</i><br />
<i>The endless glory - Thine!"</i></p>
<p><i>He ceased and sat; when sudden rose</i><br />
<i>Aloft a towering Form,</i><br />
<i>Proudly erect, as lowering peak</i><br />
<i>That looms above the storm.</i></p>
<p><i>A presence bright and beautiful,</i><br />
<i>With eye of flashing fire,</i><br />
<i>A lip whose haughty curl bespoke</i><br />
<i>A sense of inward ire.</i></p>
<p><i>"Give me to go," he boldly cried,</i><br />
<i>With scarce concealed disdain,</i><br />
<i>"And none shall hence, from heaven to earth,</i><br />
<i>That shall not rise again.</i></p>
<p><i>My saving plan exception scorns - </i><br />
<i>Mans agency unknown.</i><br />
<i>As recompense, I claim the right</i><br />
<i>To sit on yonder Throne!"</i></p>
<p><i>Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush</i><br />
<i>Resumed and denser grew.</i><br />
<i>All eyes were turned; the general gaze</i><br />
<i>One common magnet drew.</i></p>
<p><i>A moment there was solemn pause - </i><br />
<i>Then, like the thunder-burst,</i><br />
<i>Rolled forth from lips Omnipotent,</i><br />
<i>The words: "ILL SEND THE FIRST!"</i></p>
<p><i>Twas done. From congregation vast,</i><br />
<i>Tumultuous murmurs rose;</i><br />
<i>Waves of conflicting sound, as when</i><br />
<i>Two meeting seas oppose.</i></p>
<p><i>Twas finished - but the heavens wept - </i><br />
<i>And still their annals tell</i><br />
<i>How Gods elect was chosen Christ,</i><br />
<i>Oer One who fighting fell.</i><br />
["Immanuel - A Christmas Idyl," <i>The Poetical Writings of Orson F. Whitney</i> (Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1889), pp. 136142]</p>
<p><i>6. Pursuant to Gods plan, Adam and Eve made the choice that caused the Fall, making mankind subject to mortality and sin in the world.</i></p>
<p><i>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</i> [the Lord told Adam and Eve], <i>nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i> [Moses 3:17]</p>
<p>Adam and Eve were able to bring about the Fall by choice because they had alternatives and they had free agency, whose essence is described in these words: "Thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).</p>
<p>Thus we see that what we call "the Fall" and the "transgression of Adam" was a necessary step that resulted from our first parents exercise of their gift of free agency. As we read in 2 Nephi, Lehi explained:</p>
<p><i>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</i></p>
<p><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</i> [2 Nephi 2:2425]</p>
<p>With the Fall came mortality and an opportunity to be tested. The Lord told Adam that his children were given "to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves" (Moses 6:56). Alma taught that with the Fall man became</p>
<p><i>as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good.</i> [Alma 12:31; also see Alma 42:7]</p>
<p>Similarly, the prophet Samuel taught:</p>
<p><i>For behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free. </i>[Helaman 14:30]</p>
<p>Note that in this teaching the word "free" means free agency.</p>
<p>7. <i>We are here to be tested, and this cannot occur without opposition in all things.</i></p>
<p>On this subject 2 Nephi enlarges our understanding. Father Lehi taught his son Jacob:</p>
<p><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one.</i> [2 Nephi 2:11]</p>
<p>In other words, if we did not have opposition, we could not exercise our free agency by making choices. "Wherefore," Father Lehi explained, "the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other" (2 Nephi 2:16).</p>
<p>Without opposition in all things we could not achieve righteousness. All things would be a compound in one, a mixture - no distinction between wickedness and holiness. In that state of innocence, mankind would be "having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin" (2 Nephi 2:23). As we read in modern revelation,</p>
<p><i>And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.</i> [D&amp;C 29:39]</p>
<p>8. <i>To provide the needed opposition, Satan is permitted to try to persuade us to use our free agency to choose evil.</i></p>
<p>In 2 Nephi, Lehi declares that the Messiah will come "in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall" (2 Nephi 2:26). Then he gives us this important explanation:</p>
<p><i>And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</i></p>
<p><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself. </i>[2 Nephi 2:2627]</p>
<p>"Free . . . to act for themselves" and "free to choose" refer to free agency. "Free according to the flesh" refers to freedom, as I will illustrate later.</p>
<p>9. <i>If we choose evil and do not repent, we can ultimately become captives of Satan.</i></p>
<p>Lehis assurance that we are free "to act for [ourselves] and not to be acted upon" has this exception: "save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day" if we have chosen "captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:2627). He then pleads with his sons not to</p>
<p><i>choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.</i> [vs. 29]</p>
<p>Similarly, Amulek taught:</p>
<p><i>For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</i> [Alma 34:35]</p>
<p>In summary, free agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God, conferred on his children and exercised by them in the premortal existence. It is an essential precondition of the further progression we seek in mortality. But free agency cannot be exercised unless there is opposition in all things. That opposition is provided by Satan, who once sought to destroy our free agency. His effort continues. He tries to persuade us to do evil, and to make those choices that will finally give him the mastery he was denied in the premortal existence - to have all power over us, to lead us captive at his will.</p>
<h2><b>II. Application</b></h2>
<p>Now I will discuss some applications of these scriptural principles.</p>
<p><i>First,</i> because <i>free agency</i> is a God-given precondition to the purpose of mortal life, no person or organization can take away our free agency in mortality.</p>
<p><i>Second,</i> what can be taken away or reduced by the conditions of mortality is our <i>freedom,</i> the power to act upon our choices. Free agency is absolute, but in the circumstances of mortality freedom is always qualified.</p>
<p>Freedom may be qualified or taken away (1) by physical laws, including the physical limitations with which we are born, (2) by our own action, and (3) by the action of others, including governments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lehi taught his son Jacob that "men are free [have freedom] according to the</li>
</ol>
<p>flesh" (2 Nephi 2:27). For example, in the flesh we are subject to the physical law of gravity. If I should hang from the catwalk here in the Marriott Center and release my grip, I would not be free to will myself into a soft landing. And I cannot choose to run through a brick wall.</p>
<p>A loss of freedom reduces the extent to which we can act upon our choices, but it does not deprive us of our God-given free agency. A woman who has spent much of her life confined to a wheelchair expressed that thought in verse. Annie Johnson Flint writes:</p>
<p><i>I cannot walk, but I can fly;</i><br />
<i>No roof can house me from the stars</i><br />
<i>No dwelling pen me in its bounds,</i><br />
<i>Nor keep me fast with locks and bars.</i></p>
<p><i>No narrow room my thoughts can cage,</i><br />
<i>No fetters hold my roving mind;</i><br />
<i>From these four walls that shut me in,</i><br />
<i>My soaring soul a way can find. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And when the long, long day is done,</i><br />
<i>I clasp the dearest book of all,</i><br />
<i>And through the dim, sweet silences,</i><br />
<i>I hear my Fathers accents fall.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, though, in chains, yet I am free;</i><br />
<i>Beyond the pressure of my care,</i><br />
<i>Above earths night, my spirit mounts</i><br />
<i>On eagle wings of Faith and Prayer.</i><br />
["My Wings," Annie Johnson Flint]</p>
<p>2. Other limitations on freedom are self-imposed, such as the immobility we seek when we buckle our seat belt or the commitment we make when we sign a contract. In these examples we limit one freedom in order to achieve a larger and more important one.</p>
<p>3. Many losses of freedom are imposed by others. The science of government is a consideration of the procedures by which and the extent to which the official representatives of one group of citizens can impose restrictions on the freedom of another group. Decisions on the extent to which government power should restrict the freedom of individuals are among the most difficult decisions we face in an organized society. How much should zoning laws restrict a persons right to use his own property? How many taxes should we extract, and what compulsory functions should government perform with them? How much harm can society allow a person to do himself, such as by self-mutilation or drug use? These are all questions of freedom.</p>
<p>We have to accept some government limitations on freedom if we who live in communities are to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A condition of uninhibited individual freedom would allow the strong to oppress the weak. It would allow the eccentric desires of one person to restrict the freedom of many.</p>
<p>Interferences with our freedom do not deprive us of our free agency. When Pharaoh put Joseph in prison, he restricted Josephs freedom, but he did not take away his free agency. When Jesus drove the money changers out of the temple, he interfered with their freedom to engage in a particular activity at a particular time in a particular place, but he did not take away their free agency.</p>
<p>During my nine years at BYU I read many letters to the editor in the <i>Universe</i> that protested various rules as infringements of free agency. I am glad I dont see those funny arguments anymore, probably because I no longer have to read the letters to the editor in the <i>Universe</i>. The Lord has told us in modern revelation that he established the Constitution of the United States to assure "that every man may act . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him" (D&amp;C 101:78). In other words, God established our Constitution to give us the vital political freedom necessary for us to act upon our personal choices in civil government. This revelation shows the distinction between <i>agency</i> (the power of choice), which is God-given, and <i>freedom,</i> the right to act upon our choices, which is protected by the Constitution and laws of the land.</p>
<p>Freedom is obviously of great importance, but as these examples illustrate, freedom is always qualified in mortality. Consequently, when we oppose a government-imposed loss of freedom, it would be better if we did not conduct our debate in terms of a loss of our free agency, which is impossible under our doctrine. We ought to focus on the legality or the wisdom of the proposed restriction of our freedom.</p>
<p><i>Third,</i> we receive assurance from our doctrine that Satan, who sought to take away our free agency in the premortal existence, is not permitted to take it from us in this life. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the devil cannot compel men to do evil; he has "power over us only as we permit him" (<i>Teachings,</i> pp. 181, 187, 189). Elder James E. Faust elaborated this in our last conference, when he said, "Certainly he can tempt and he can deceive, but he has no authority over us which we do not give him" ("The Great Imitator," <i>Ensign,</i> October 1987, p. 35).</p>
<p><i>Fourth,</i> as suggested by these teachings, Satan is still trying to take away our free agency by persuading us to voluntarily surrender our will to his.</p>
<p>This subject has a morbid fascination for mankind. The long-lived German legend of Faust concerns a man who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power. This is also the theme of Stephen Vincent Benets "The Devil and Daniel Webster." A variety of modern practices tend toward this surrender, and they carry eternal dangers. As Elder Faust warned us at conference,</p>
<p><i>The mischief of devil worship, sorcery, casting spells, witchcraft, voodooism, black magic, and all other forms of demonism should be avoided like the plague.</i> ["The Great Imitator," p. 33]</p>
<p><i>Fifth,</i> we should also avoid any practices in which one person attempts to surrender even part of his will to another person or in which another person attempts to take it. Whether the means are chemical, behavioral, electronic, or others not yet dreamed of, such attempts run counter to the heavenly plan and further the adversarys plan. Free agency, the power to choose and direct our thoughts and our actions, is a gift of God, and we should resist any means that would compromise it.</p>
<p><i>Sixth,</i> we should avoid any behavior that is addictive. Whatever is addictive compromises our will. Subjecting our will to the overbearing impulses imposed by any form of addiction serves Satans purposes and subverts our Heavenly Fathers. This applies to addictions to drugs (such as narcotics, alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine), addiction to practices such as gambling, and any other addictive behavior. We can avoid addictions by keeping the commandments of God.</p>
<p><i>Seventh,</i> we should be aware that some people are more susceptible to some addictions than other people. Perhaps such susceptibility is inborn, like the unnamed ailment the Apostle Paul called "a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure" (2 Corinthians 12:7). One person has a taste for nicotine and is easily addicted to smoking. Another person cannot take an occasional drink without being propelled into alcoholism. Another person samples gambling and becomes a compulsive gambler.</p>
<p>Perhaps these persons, as the saying goes, were "born that way." But what does this mean? Does it mean that persons with susceptibilities or strong tendencies have no choice, no free agency in these matters? Our doctrine teaches us otherwise. Regardless of a persons susceptibility or tendency, his will is unfettered. His free agency is unqualified. It is his freedom that is impaired. Other persons are more free; though they unwisely sample the temptations, they seem immune to the addiction. But regardless of the extent of our freedom, we are all responsible for the exercise of our free agency.</p>
<p>As Lehi taught, in mortality we are only free "according to the flesh" (2 Nephi 2:27). Most of us are born with thorns in the flesh - some more visible, some more serious than others. We all seem to have susceptibilities to one disorder or another, but whatever our susceptibilities, we have the will and the power to control our thoughts and our actions. This must be so. God has said that he holds us accountable for what we do and what we think, so these must be controllable by our agency. Once we have reached the age or condition of accountability, "I was born that way" does not excuse actions or thoughts that fail to conform to the commandments of God. We need to learn how to live so that a weakness that is mortal will not prevent us from achieving the goal that is eternal.</p>
<p>God has promised that he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain (see 2 Nephi 2:2). The efforts we expend in overcoming an inherited weakness build spiritual strength that will serve us throughout eternity. Thus, when Paul prayed thrice that his "thorn in the flesh" would depart from him, the Lord replied, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Obedient, Paul concluded,</p>
<p><i>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</i></p>
<p><i>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</i> [2 Corinthians 12:910]</p>
<p>Whatever our susceptibilities or tendencies, they cannot subject us to eternal consequences unless we exercise our free agency to do or think the things forbidden by the commandments of God. For example, a susceptibility to alcoholism impairs its victims freedom to partake without addiction, but his free agency allows him to abstain and thus escape the physical debilitation of alcohol and the spiritual deterioration of addiction.</p>
<p><i>Eighth,</i> beware the argument that because a person has strong drives toward a particular act that he has no power of choice and therefore no responsibility for his actions. This contention runs counter to the most fundamental premises of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Satan would like us to believe that we are not responsible in this life. That is the result he tried to achieve by his contest in the premortal existence. A person who insists that he is not responsible for the exercise of his free agency because he was "born that way" is trying to ignore the outcome of the War in Heaven. We are responsible, and if we argue otherwise, our efforts become part of the propaganda effort of the adversary.</p>
<p>Individual responsibility is a law of life. It applies in the law of man and the law of God. Society holds people responsible to control their impulses so we can live in a civilized society. God holds his children responsible to control their impulses so they can keep his commandments and realize their eternal destiny. The law does not excuse the short-tempered man who surrenders to his impulse to pull a trigger on his tormentor, or the greedy man who surrenders to his impulse to steal, or the pedophile who surrenders to his impulse to satisfy his sexual desires with children.</p>
<p>I suppose it is inevitable that those who have surrendered to impulse would try to use the defense of "irresistible impulse." But in the courts on high, this defense will be transparent to the Great Judge, who sees all our actions and "knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Alma 18:32).</p>
<p>There is much we do not know about the extent of freedom we have in view of the various thorns in the flesh that afflict us in mortality. But this much we do know, we <i>all</i> have our free agency, and God holds us accountable for the way we use it in thought and deed. That is fundamental.</p>
<p>God has commanded us not to become entangled in sin (see D&amp;C 88:86). In modern revelation he said:</p>
<p><i>And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.</i> [D&amp;C 38:42]</p>
<p>This principle of individual responsibility and these commands to go out from among the wicked and to be clean apply to a multitude of circumstances. In terms of free agency and freedom, I urge you to apply these commands in this way: If you have a weakness or a susceptibility to some particular transgression, especially one that can be addictive, use your free agency and your freedom to steer a course far from the circumstances of that particular transgression.</p>
<p>May God bless us to live our lives so as to avoid entangling ourselves in sin and compromising our precious and unique gift of free agency. May we accept responsibility for our thoughts and our actions. May we use our free agency to make righteous choices and to act upon them as we have the freedom to do so.</p>
<p>For my conclusion I come back to the words of Nephi in the concluding chapter of 2 Nephi:</p>
<p><i>I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people . . . .</i> [2 Nephi 33:3]</p>
<p><i>And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth . . .</i> .[v. 5]</p>
<p><i>. . . And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good . . . .</i> [v. 10]</p>
<p><i>And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.</i> [v. 12]</p>
<p>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you in this opening session of the 2017 BYU Campus Education Week. This years theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 50:24, with special emphasis on these words: "And he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light."
I am going to take a different approach to this theme than might be expected by exposing and illustrating some very cunning and effective ways that the "wicked one" prevents people from progressing and receiving more light (D&amp;C 93:39).
Many gospel principles come in pairs, meaning one is incomplete without the other. I want to refer to three of these doctrinal pairs today:

Agency and responsibility
Mercy and justice
Faith and works

When Satan is successful in dividing doctrinal pairs, he begins to wreak havoc upon mankind. It is one of his most cunning strategies to keep people from growing in the light.
You already know that faith without works really isnt faith (see James 2:17). My primary focus will be on the other two doctrinal pairs: first, to illustrate how avoiding responsibility affects agency; and second, how "denying justice," as it is referred to in the Book of Mormon (see Alma 42:30), affects mercy.
The Book of Mormon teaches us that we are agents to "act . . . and not to be acted upon" (2 Nephi 2:26) - or to be "free to act for [our]selves" (2 Nephi 10:23). This freedom of choice was not a gift of partial agency but of complete and total 100 percent agency. It was absolute in the sense that the One Perfect Parent never forces His children. He shows us the way and may even command us, but, "nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).
Assuming responsibility and being accountable for our choices are agencys complementary principles (see D&amp;C 101:78). Responsibility is to recognize ourselves as being the cause for the effects or results of our choices - good or bad. On the negative side, it is to always own up to the consequences of poor choices.
Except for those held innocent, such as little children and the intellectually disabled, gospel doctrine teaches us that each person is responsible for the use of their agency and "will be punished for their own sins" (Articles of Faith 1:2).1 It isnt just a heavenly principle but a law of nature - we reap what we sow.
Logically then, complete and total agency comes with complete and total responsibility:
 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it u</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">One of the most cunning aspects of the adversarys efforts to thwart our Father in Heavens plan of happiness is his deceitful teaching that there is no evil influence or devil1 and his attempt to redefine evil as good and good as evil, darkness as light and light as darkness, and bitter as sweet and sweet as bitter!2
This is sometimes called a paradigm shift - or "when the usual way of thinking about or doing something is replaced by a new and different way,"3 thus portraying things to be exactly the opposite of what they really are. In his classic novel The Screwtape Letters, C. S. Lewis wrote from a senior devils point of view. Lewis inverted traditional values using irony and satire to make evil appear good and good appear evil.4
In this vein I had a provocative meeting with an internationally recognized advertising expert a few months ago. He is an unusually gifted and creative thinker. We were discussing the influence of evil and the consequences of bad choices.
He envisioned an interesting hypothetical account of the adversary (Lucifer) meeting with an advertising agency. The adversary described his dilemma: He and his followers had rebelled and rejected the Fathers plan and had come to understand they could not prevail against God. Lucifer understood that while the Fathers plan was about joy and happiness, his own plan was resulting in grief and misery. The problem, Lucifer explained to the ad executive, was how to attract followers.
After contemplating this problem, it was determined that Lucifers only hope of success was to achieve a paradigm shift or values inversion - in other words, to characterize the Fathers plan as resulting in grief and misery and Lucifers plan as resulting in joy and happiness.
While this contemplated meeting with an advertising agency is hypothetical, it serves a useful purpose. The truth is, not only do the enemies of Fathers plan attempt to undermine the doctrine and principles of the plan, but they also attempt to mischaracterize the blessings that flow from the plan. Their basic effort is to make that which is good, righteous, and joyful seem utterly miserable.
I will discuss some of the adversarys efforts to mischaracterize and undermine the blessings of living according to the Fathers plan.
Word of Wisdom
My first example is the Word of Wisdom. I fully recognize that you magnificent students understand the importance of the Word of Wisdom and have agreed, on your honor, to live by it. However, over the course of a lifetime I have seen many of my friends lives blighted and sometimes destroyed by alcohol. An alcohol culture isnt just about Church doctrine; it is about the health and happiness of everyone. You can be an important voice in educating society about the consequences of this issue.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I was born in Mountain View, California, the second of (eventually) eleven children. We settled in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the east side of San Jose, not far from the rolling foothills that are crowned by the imposing Mount Hamilton, home to the Lick Observatory, "the first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory in the world."1 The weather was usually pleasant, even during the warm, sunny days of summer. As spring yielded to summer, the foothills would turn from a verdant green to a cozy, warm brown. But even on hot days, a cool breeze would flow off the bay every afternoon just as temperatures were peaking for the day.
Our subdivision consisted of a single principal street with four cul-de-sacs branching off toward the east. To the south was a walnut orchard that, in a childs mind, seemed dark and foreboding - the stuff of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. To the east was a large strawberry field. One day Mom sent my older brother, Jim, and me out to pick strawberries. I remember doing a lot of picking and eating; I dont remember bringing much home in the bowl she gave us.
Shortly thereafter, bulldozers and earthmovers took over as Interstate 680 came to our neighborhood. The walnut orchard also gave way to construction. "Silicon Valley" had to be built, and it seemed we were in the middle of it.
When I was fourteen years old, my father decided to purchase a microcomputer kit. This seemed like a sensible activity for a systems analyst in Silicon Valley. He chose the Heathkit H-89, and it was as amazing in 1979 as an iPad is today! I am sorry to get a little nerdy here, but I need to paint the picture properly. The H-89 was an all-in-one model with a keyboard and a twelve-inch display built right in. Its brain was an eight-bit Zilog brand Z80 CPU2 that ran at more than two megahertz (that is more than two million clock cycles per second). The kit came standard with 16K of RAM,3 but since Dad bought three expansion packs over time, we eventually had an entire 56K of RAM in which to lose ourselves. (In contrast, a typical smartphone today has billions of bytes of RAM and executes billions of clock cycles each second.)
Dad let us older boys help build the thing, but, as I recall, I was the most zealous deputy in the bunch. We had to bolt and solder all sorts of parts together, and soon enough there was this box - a true marvel of engineering and a testament to not only mankinds creativity but also our ability to follow complex instructions and manipulate tiny parts. There it was, sitting on our kitchen table with its fan purring, enthusiastically waiting for that next instruction to come in from its mass storage device, a cassette tape recorder. (Yes, it took another upgrade before we could use modern, high-capacity floppy disk technology.4)
The computer was built, so what next? I had to learn how to program it. I knew how it was as</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">We are and will be faced with all types of choices throughout our lives. Each choice we make or action we take carries some type of consequence. The consequence can be positive or negative. A consequence does not always have to be negative; I think we are conditioned to think of consequences as negative. Sometimes consequences appear to be both negative and positive, depending on your point of view.
Sometimes we make choices thinking we are doing good, only to have our good intentions and deeds backfire and make a bad situation worse. Sometimes we immediately regret a decision or choice. Sometimes regret comes later and with someone saying to us, "I told you so." Other times we may say or do something that we later find out actually inspired or uplifted someone. Sometimes we choose not to make a choice and instead let nature or circumstances unfold as they will. This reminds me of several lines from one of my favorite songs by Rush called "Freewill":
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill.
I will choose a path thats clear;
I will choose freewill.
Choosing Your Path
One of the great blessings we enjoy in this life is the blessing of choice - choosing the path our life will take and, maybe more important, the type of person we want to become.
We have a huge number of directions we can steer our lives in. You can allow others to steer for you and guide you on the path. There are plenty of people who will be more than happy to tell you what you should and should not do. They may even let you pay them for their advice. You can also decide to do whatever you fancy - it is your life, after all, and God has blessed you with agency. Or you can let life happen and just roll with the changes. Or maybe, best yet, you can be proactive and make the choices that best suit you and the direction you want your life to take.
Let me caution you that simply making certain decisions does not guarantee that you will end up exactly where you expect to be. The choice I am talking about is the type of person you want to be, regardless of where your life and vocation take you.
When I was in junior high and high school I was interested in several careers. The first and foremost was to play professional football. The second was to coach football and be a PE teacher. The third and most fleeting was to be a lead singer for an epic hard rock band.
The lead singer career was the first to fade as I realized three facts about myself: (1) I am not a good singer or screamer, (2) I really dont enjoy being on stage in front of people, and (3) I wasnt really ready for the superstar lifestyle and all that comes with it.
My poor singing ability was reconfirmed to me some years ago when my ward choir pleaded for male voices. They said any male voice was welcome. I</span>
