  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Eighteen days ago our daughter-in-law Sharon gave birth to twin boys, James and John. As you can imagine, there was much rejoicing the morning they were born. Excited and loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends all lined up in front of the hospital nursery window, marveling at the beautiful little faces and perfect little bodies.

"Are they identical?" we all asked. The preliminary tests were inconclusive, which of course only made us more curious. We stared at them, placed side by side, and compared them from their ears down to their toes. Was one lighter, darker, fatter, thinner, smaller, or bigger than his brother? This led to other questions in our minds: Would one be more athletically or musically inclined? Would one have an easier time in school? Would one have more friends?

Watching from outside the nursery window, we could see the new father, our son Michael, busily going from one baby to the other, speaking softly and gently touching them. When we were finally able to talk with him in the hallway, he was full of excitement and pride about how each one was doing, noting their individual characteristics. In our curiosity we had been drawing comparisons, but Michael, as the loving father, had focused on each boy separately.

As I left the hospital, I continued to think about these new little members of our family and whether it would be hard to be compared constantly with someone else. I hoped that our family would be able to value each child individually.

Then I began to think about life and how we often tend to compare ourselves to others. We compete with brothers, sisters, roommates, friends, or people with whom we work and go to school. Sometimes we even seem to be in competition with our husbands or wives. A few days later, still reflecting on this thought, I remarked to a friend, "Life is like being in school. We are continually grading ourselves on some imagined scorecard, trying to see who gets the A.

"You must remember," my wise friend answered, "the Lord does not grade on a curve."

This remarkable phrase caught my attention. Whatever we are doing, wherever we see ourselves on the scale of life, we need to put aside the worlds preconceived notions of what we should be and remember, "The Lord doesnt grade on a curve."

We all want to do our best as we go through life. Sometimes, however, the most visible measuring stick we use to examine how we are doing is the one devised by the world. We naturally recognize people who are "at the top." We applaud them, we see their names on honor rolls, we read about them in newspapers and magazines, and we try to emulate them. There is nothing wrong with that except when we try to determine our intrinsic worth or the value of those around us by our comparative grades, social status, acclaim, appearance, salaries, degrees, or possessions.

It is an inevitable fact of life that we compare ourselves to others. Yet it can be a very dangerous practice. If we give ourselves a superior rating, we fall into the trap of pride. President Ezra Taft Benson has warned us that "the proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success" ("Beware of Pride," &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;May 1989, p. 6).

If we see ourselves at the top of the ladder, we diminish the significance of others, sometimes overlooking important qualities that our grading scale ignores. We may not even be aware that we are doing this.

Not long ago, Rex and I visited a small ward in another part of the world. There was no organ or piano present. The bishop didnt own a suit jacket or even a tie. The Relief Society president didnt use a day planner. But the spirit in those meetings filled our hearts with love for our Savior and for our fellow beings. We went there thinking that because of our vast Church experience here on the Wasatch Front, there might be some way we could help lift or teach this little ward. Instead, they taught and lifted us with their pure testimonies of Christ.

An equally dangerous practice is giving ourselves an inferior rating. In this instance we often compare our weakest points with everybody elses strongest ones. If we believe we are at the bottom of the ladder of success, we feel defeated. I remember one afternoon sitting as a family in a sacrament meeting where a talented family performed a beautiful musical number. Each instrument was perfectly tuned and exquisitely played, creating an atmosphere of truly celestial music. At first I listened attentively, but soon a part of me became distracted as my thoughts broke through the Spirit. What kind of mother am I? I should have made our children practice more. Then, glancing at my row of children, I thought: Dont kid yourself - our gene pool just didnt produce great musicians. I supposed we could polish the piano keys, carry the instrument cases, or even wheel in the harp. But at that moment, in my very narrow perception, I felt we were among the lowly, and this musical family was surely several rungs up the celestial staircase.

Why do we do that to ourselves? When someone else does something well or owns something we do not have, why do we immediately knock ourselves down a rung or two? Appreciating the abilities and resources of others should lift us, not diminish us in any way. Every time we see or hear something of merit, we should be better because of it. The Lord must have intended it to be that way, because each of us has been given different gifts, unique abilities, and varying insights.

We cannot have every talent and every virtue. The only way we can experience all that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy is to enjoy at least some of it vicariously. We may never play tennis like Chris Evert, sing like Ariel Bybee, or throw a football like Steve Young, but we can come closer to appreciating those talents if we spend our time in joyful observation rather than in degrading envy. If we are troubled by the inadequacies of our home when we visit our neighbor, then we have rejected their gift of hospitality. If we belittle ourselves when we study with a brilliant friend, we close our minds to at least part of what we could be taught. If we berate ourselves as we observe the gentle nature of President Hunter, we miss the magic of his example. Being able to appreciate and encourage the gifts of others may well be the greatest gift of all.

The third danger is viewing ourselves in a dead heat with those around us. We need to be reminded that life is not a horse race. This past semester a student returned from the testing center with a lower grade than expected. She was discouraged, knowing she could have studied harder. Then one of her roommates suggested that she should wait to be depressed until she found out how everyone else in the class had done. Maybe the curve would be in her favor after all.

Sometimes this is how we view life. We justify our actions, feeling that those around us are doing no better than we are. In this situation we choose to make comparisons only with those who make us feel good about ourselves when we are not doing our best. When we do that, we are forgetting once again that the Lord does not grade on a curve.

The story of Enoch helps us to realize the Lords ability to measure our individual potential and worth. At the time the Lord called Enoch to prophesy to the people, Enoch basically responded, "Why have you chosen me?" He explained all the reasons he feels incapable: "I . . . am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech" (Moses 6:31). But the Lord knew Enochs heart and blessed him to become a mighty prophet who was respected and loved by the people.

As Elder Marvin J. Ashton explained:

&lt;i&gt;When the Lord measures an individual, He does not take a tape measure around the persons head to determine his mental capacity, nor his chest to determine his manliness, but He measures the heart as an indicator of the persons capacity and potential to bless others. &lt;/i&gt;["The Measure of Our Hearts," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt;November 1988, p. 15]

Never will our eternal value be measured in comparison with anothers performance. The Lord doesnt think in terms of quotas - only qualities. He does not accept just the top ten percent. He wants all of us. He sees our worth from where we are today and what we can become tomorrow. Each of us stands on equal footing as we work to develop Christlike qualities such as love, humility, patience, and charity. He will attend to our individual needs and assess our progress because it is "his work and his glory" to help us succeed.

When our measuring stick is Christs life and teachings, we need no other comparison. As President Hunter says, the Savior

&lt;i&gt;set a perfect example of right living, of kindness and mercy and compassion, in order that all of the rest of mankind might know how to live, know how to improve, and know how to become more godlike. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . We should try to be like him, even as the Primary children sing, "Try, try, try." (Childrens Songbook, &lt;/i&gt;p. 55). ["What Manner of Men Ought Ye to Be?"&lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;May 1994, p. 64]

I testify to you that each of us is loved and valued beyond any earthly means of measuring. Because the Lord knows our hearts and sees our individual worth, he does not grade us on a curve. That we may see ourselves and others in this light as we strive to emulate the teachings of our Savior is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Eighteen days ago our daughter-in-law Sharon gave birth to twin boys, James and John. As you can imagine, there was much rejoicing the morning they were born. Excited and loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends all lined up in front of the hospital nursery window, marveling at the beautiful little faces and perfect little bodies.</p>
<p>"Are they identical?" we all asked. The preliminary tests were inconclusive, which of course only made us more curious. We stared at them, placed side by side, and compared them from their ears down to their toes. Was one lighter, darker, fatter, thinner, smaller, or bigger than his brother? This led to other questions in our minds: Would one be more athletically or musically inclined? Would one have an easier time in school? Would one have more friends?</p>
<p>Watching from outside the nursery window, we could see the new father, our son Michael, busily going from one baby to the other, speaking softly and gently touching them. When we were finally able to talk with him in the hallway, he was full of excitement and pride about how each one was doing, noting their individual characteristics. In our curiosity we had been drawing comparisons, but Michael, as the loving father, had focused on each boy separately.</p>
<p>As I left the hospital, I continued to think about these new little members of our family and whether it would be hard to be compared constantly with someone else. I hoped that our family would be able to value each child individually.</p>
<p>Then I began to think about life and how we often tend to compare ourselves to others. We compete with brothers, sisters, roommates, friends, or people with whom we work and go to school. Sometimes we even seem to be in competition with our husbands or wives. A few days later, still reflecting on this thought, I remarked to a friend, "Life is like being in school. We are continually grading ourselves on some imagined scorecard, trying to see who gets the A.</p>
<p>"You must remember," my wise friend answered, "the Lord does not grade on a curve."</p>
<p>This remarkable phrase caught my attention. Whatever we are doing, wherever we see ourselves on the scale of life, we need to put aside the worlds preconceived notions of what we should be and remember, "The Lord doesnt grade on a curve."</p>
<p>We all want to do our best as we go through life. Sometimes, however, the most visible measuring stick we use to examine how we are doing is the one devised by the world. We naturally recognize people who are "at the top." We applaud them, we see their names on honor rolls, we read about them in newspapers and magazines, and we try to emulate them. There is nothing wrong with that except when we try to determine our intrinsic worth or the value of those around us by our comparative grades, social status, acclaim, appearance, salaries, degrees, or possessions.</p>
<p>It is an inevitable fact of life that we compare ourselves to others. Yet it can be a very dangerous practice. If we give ourselves a superior rating, we fall into the trap of pride. President Ezra Taft Benson has warned us that "the proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success" ("Beware of Pride," <i>Ensign, </i>May 1989, p. 6).</p>
<p>If we see ourselves at the top of the ladder, we diminish the significance of others, sometimes overlooking important qualities that our grading scale ignores. We may not even be aware that we are doing this.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Rex and I visited a small ward in another part of the world. There was no organ or piano present. The bishop didnt own a suit jacket or even a tie. The Relief Society president didnt use a day planner. But the spirit in those meetings filled our hearts with love for our Savior and for our fellow beings. We went there thinking that because of our vast Church experience here on the Wasatch Front, there might be some way we could help lift or teach this little ward. Instead, they taught and lifted us with their pure testimonies of Christ.</p>
<p>An equally dangerous practice is giving ourselves an inferior rating. In this instance we often compare our weakest points with everybody elses strongest ones. If we believe we are at the bottom of the ladder of success, we feel defeated. I remember one afternoon sitting as a family in a sacrament meeting where a talented family performed a beautiful musical number. Each instrument was perfectly tuned and exquisitely played, creating an atmosphere of truly celestial music. At first I listened attentively, but soon a part of me became distracted as my thoughts broke through the Spirit. What kind of mother am I? I should have made our children practice more. Then, glancing at my row of children, I thought: Dont kid yourself - our gene pool just didnt produce great musicians. I supposed we could polish the piano keys, carry the instrument cases, or even wheel in the harp. But at that moment, in my very narrow perception, I felt we were among the lowly, and this musical family was surely several rungs up the celestial staircase.</p>
<p>Why do we do that to ourselves? When someone else does something well or owns something we do not have, why do we immediately knock ourselves down a rung or two? Appreciating the abilities and resources of others should lift us, not diminish us in any way. Every time we see or hear something of merit, we should be better because of it. The Lord must have intended it to be that way, because each of us has been given different gifts, unique abilities, and varying insights.</p>
<p>We cannot have every talent and every virtue. The only way we can experience all that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy is to enjoy at least some of it vicariously. We may never play tennis like Chris Evert, sing like Ariel Bybee, or throw a football like Steve Young, but we can come closer to appreciating those talents if we spend our time in joyful observation rather than in degrading envy. If we are troubled by the inadequacies of our home when we visit our neighbor, then we have rejected their gift of hospitality. If we belittle ourselves when we study with a brilliant friend, we close our minds to at least part of what we could be taught. If we berate ourselves as we observe the gentle nature of President Hunter, we miss the magic of his example. Being able to appreciate and encourage the gifts of others may well be the greatest gift of all.</p>
<p>The third danger is viewing ourselves in a dead heat with those around us. We need to be reminded that life is not a horse race. This past semester a student returned from the testing center with a lower grade than expected. She was discouraged, knowing she could have studied harder. Then one of her roommates suggested that she should wait to be depressed until she found out how everyone else in the class had done. Maybe the curve would be in her favor after all.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is how we view life. We justify our actions, feeling that those around us are doing no better than we are. In this situation we choose to make comparisons only with those who make us feel good about ourselves when we are not doing our best. When we do that, we are forgetting once again that the Lord does not grade on a curve.</p>
<p>The story of Enoch helps us to realize the Lords ability to measure our individual potential and worth. At the time the Lord called Enoch to prophesy to the people, Enoch basically responded, "Why have you chosen me?" He explained all the reasons he feels incapable: "I . . . am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech" (Moses 6:31). But the Lord knew Enochs heart and blessed him to become a mighty prophet who was respected and loved by the people.</p>
<p>As Elder Marvin J. Ashton explained:</p>
<p><i>When the Lord measures an individual, He does not take a tape measure around the persons head to determine his mental capacity, nor his chest to determine his manliness, but He measures the heart as an indicator of the persons capacity and potential to bless others. </i>["The Measure of Our Hearts," <i>Ensign,</i>November 1988, p. 15]</p>
<p>Never will our eternal value be measured in comparison with anothers performance. The Lord doesnt think in terms of quotas - only qualities. He does not accept just the top ten percent. He wants all of us. He sees our worth from where we are today and what we can become tomorrow. Each of us stands on equal footing as we work to develop Christlike qualities such as love, humility, patience, and charity. He will attend to our individual needs and assess our progress because it is "his work and his glory" to help us succeed.</p>
<p>When our measuring stick is Christs life and teachings, we need no other comparison. As President Hunter says, the Savior</p>
<p><i>set a perfect example of right living, of kindness and mercy and compassion, in order that all of the rest of mankind might know how to live, know how to improve, and know how to become more godlike. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . We should try to be like him, even as the Primary children sing, "Try, try, try." (Childrens Songbook, </i>p. 55). ["What Manner of Men Ought Ye to Be?"<i>Ensign, </i>May 1994, p. 64]</p>
<p>I testify to you that each of us is loved and valued beyond any earthly means of measuring. Because the Lord knows our hearts and sees our individual worth, he does not grade us on a curve. That we may see ourselves and others in this light as we strive to emulate the teachings of our Savior is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Six years ago President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave a profound conference talk entitled "You Matter to Him."1 In his talk he explained that God is the Creator of all things and yet is concerned about each one of us individually. Today I would like to build upon President Uchtdorfs topic and title my remarks "BYU Matters to Him." However, I would like to redefine the acronym for Brigham Young University as B-Y-You, as in you (y-o-u). Thus the title of my address is "B-Y-You Matter to Him."
This past semester one of my students submitted the following account. With her permission, I share her tender feelings about when she first arrived at BYU:
 Leaving everything you have known for the entirety of your life to attend a university that is 547 miles away is difficult. You can no longer lean on the support of your family and friends; you can no longer enjoy the safety and security of your home; you can no longer simply follow your parents. Your life is in your own hands, and it is terrifying. I distinctly remember the hurricane of emotions I experienced as I bid farewell to my dad as he drove away, leaving me standing outside my dorm with five people I had never met. I had to make my own food, and I felt sorely unprepared. Actually, I felt more than unprepared - I felt absolutely and entirely lost.
My student then went on to describe her feelings that day as those of "ultimate vulnerability."2
As I pondered my students feelings of vulnerability and isolation, I felt a personal surge of deja vu from when I first arrived at BYU some forty-seven years ago. My students account stirred within me some tender and painful emotions from decades past. I suspect that many of you here today can also recall the daunting memories of when you first arrived on this campus. As I address you today, perhaps some of you find yourself in the throes of similar feelings of trepidation or of being lost.
The Greatness of BYU
I do not mean to minimize these feelings of loneliness or intimidation, but they present a marked contrast to the feelings we first had when we were accepted to BYU. Consider the following glossy accolades and advantages of attending Brigham Young University.
BYU consistently ranks in the top 25 percent of national universities.3 BYU is in the top five of the best value universities4 and costs around $30,000 less per year than other private schools.5 Consequently, BYU students graduate with substantially less debt.6 BYU is the number-one stone-cold sober university,7 and students will never have to tolerate drunk classmates or professors. Also, BYU has launched more of its students into PhD programs than Harvard, Yale, or Stanford.8 Upon arrival, every student here has a church unit waiting to receive and support them. Additionally, more than 60 percent of the students</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I tell people I am a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics and English Language, I am often asked, "How many languages do you speak?" Or they may react and say, "Oh, Id better watch my grammar." While it is true that linguists study language, they study it in many different ways, not just by learning languages or by watching for grammar mistakes. I would like to give you a taste of what some of the linguists in our department and college do.
A few of my colleagues study and describe lesser-known languages - some that are spoken in North America, such as the Ute and Salish languages, along with other languages spoken around the world, such as Quichua, Xinkan, and Marshallese. Other colleagues study older forms of language, such as Old, Middle, and Early Modern English, with some examining how language has changed over time. Others investigate the language rules we are taught and which rules are useful to us today. One colleague studies how ambiguity in language - that is, how words or sentences can have more than one meaning - is applied in advertising. Others study how the pronunciation, words, and grammar of a language vary from one region or group to another. Another colleague has dedicated many years to researching the language in the Book of Mormon and constructing its original text. Some use technology to solve difficult and complex language problems. Others use databases containing millions of words to find language patterns, while others look for words and language patterns used by specific writers. Another group focuses on how languages are learned, particularly second languages, with some investigating the best ways to accurately measure proficiency in a language.
This research has been applied to a number of real-world problems by supporting language-preservation projects, creating language-frequency dictionaries and academic vocabulary lists, helping missionaries learn languages and assessing their progress, and extracting genealogical facts from texts in a fraction of the time it used to take.
These are just a few examples, but as you can see, there is much diversity in what my colleagues study; however, one thing they have in common is that they are passionate about and engaged in their research and teaching. While they have different stories of how they were led to study linguistics, they all have dedicated much of their time and effort to making their unique contributions to our field.
You do not have to be a linguist to be interested in language. You may have noticed differences in your own language or in others language when you came here to BYU or as you have traveled to different places. Some of you may have taken surveys available online that sometimes quite accurately pinpoint the area of the country you are from. These surveys include questions about how you pronounce different words. How do you pronounce these words: mountain, crayon, caramel? Do you p</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, friends. A few months ago I had the opportunity to travel to Italy for the first time. While there I saw art created by the great masters: Michelangelo, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, and many others. In Milan I was able to see the famed The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci. This mural is in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and to see it one must purchase tickets ahead of time and wait for ones fifteen minutes with the painting. When my time drew near, I was corralled with twenty-four others into a waiting area, guided through two air-locked chambers, and finally allowed in front of the painting for fifteen minutes of communion.
As I sat there I contemplated the painting and why it is considered priceless - the value of which is beyond measure. Is it because the painting is old, created in the fifteenth century? Is it because of where it is located - in Milan? Is it because access is limited - few people can see it, so it is more valuable than paintings just anyone can see? Is it because it has been threatened in the past - like when Napoleon used the convent as an armory, a prison, and a stable or when it was partially destroyed by bombs during World War II? Is it because it was painted in an unconventional style - on a dry wall versus in the wet plaster - making it more fragile and rare? Is it because of who painted it - the great master da Vinci? Is it because of its subject?
These questions and others I chewed on while sitting and looking at this painting. Id like to say that I came up with profound answers that shook me to my core, but instead I came up with more questions. How do we measure value? What makes something - and, more important, someone - of worth?
Defining Value
As a professor of literature and culture, it is my job to look at systems of meaning and value, language being the first and foremost. If we go to the Oxford English Dictionary - the fifth standard work for all English majors - excerpts from the entry for the word value (n) read:
 worth or quality as measured by a standard of equivalence
 a standard of estimation or exchange
 [something] worth having
 material or monetary worth of something
 an appraisement
 relative rank or importance
 worth based on esteem
 estimation [based on] real or supposed desirability or utility [later extended] to an individual or group
 opinion of or liking for a person or thing
 worth or worthiness . . . in respect of rank1
According to these definitions, a things value is contingent on ideas of estimation, desirability, likeability, and worthiness. It is at the center of the word evaluate - to analyze - yet often we do not ask the questions, Who determines the system of val</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In his much-quoted talk on dating versus hanging out, Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:
A message given by a General Authority at a general conference . . . is given to be heard under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, with the intended result that the listener learns from the talk and from the Spirit what he or she should do about it. ["The Dedication of a Lifetime," CES fireside for young adults, Oakland, California, 1 May 2005; emphasis in original]
No one is more aware than your speaker today that you are not, in this gathering, listening to a General Authority at a general conference. However, I hope the same principle will apply: that something you hear in the words of the prophets and the scriptures we will consider this morning will impress upon your mind and heart something you personally "should do about it."
President Gordon B. Hinckley has repeatedly emphasized a harsh reality of which you are all aware. He has said, "The world into which you will move will be terribly competitive" ("Words of the Prophet: A Chosen Generation," New Era, January 1999, 6). He has also said, "You are moving into the most competitive age the world has ever known. All around you is competition" ("A Prophets Counsel and Prayer for Youth," Ensign, January 2001, 4). In general conference in April 2007, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said that our culture has an "obsession with comparing [and] competing" ("The Tongue of Angels," Ensign, May 2007, 17).
This morning I would like to review with you certain principles taught in the scriptures and by living prophets that relate to comparing and competing, first in our academic and professional lives, then more generally in our personal lives.
Preparation
One way to deal with academic and professional competition was recommended to me by my graduate advisor. He said, "The most important thing you need to do in graduate school is to impress the right people." I thought that the gospel teaches us that we arent supposed to do things to "be seen of men" (Matthew 6:5), to call attention to ourselves, and to "aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;C 121:35). And yet my advisor seemed to be saying that if I was going to succeed as a graduate student, thats exactly what I needed to do.
Of course there is truth in my advisors observation. Obviously, if you dont impress the coach, you dont make the team; if you dont impress an employer, you dont get the job. Many seek to impress others and aspire to the honors of men by deliberately calling attention to themselves. Jesus chastised those in His time who did "all their works . . . to be seen of men" (Matthew 23:5).
In April 2007 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer said:
To seek after the praise of men, the scriptures caution us, is to be led carefully away from the only safe path to f</span>
