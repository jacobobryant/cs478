  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you, President Samuelson, for that warm and friendly introduction. Sister Rasband and I are deeply honored to be here today to participate in this devotional.

We are grateful to have had all five of our own children, and some of their spouses, attend Brigham Young University and are pleased to have several of them, as well as other members of our extended family and dear friends, here in the audience with us today.

The year 2009 will be a historic year for the Church in Utah as we participate in the cultural events, open houses, and dedications of the Draper Utah and Oquirrh Mountain Utah temples in the Salt Lake Valley. These significant events are wonderful reminders and opportunities for us to inspire and strengthen each other in our personal commitment to attend the temple and worship there on a regular basis.

As we gather here this morning on the campus of Brigham Young University, thousands of members and many of those not of our faith are walking through the Draper Utah Temple, as the open house is under way for an eight-week period prior to the dedication. Obviously there is an extremely high interest among our members and friends to walk through this beautiful, new temple and experience the beauty, spirit, and inspiration that come with such a visit. This is the first temple open house in the Salt Lake Valley since 1981, when the Jordan River Temple had an open house and was dedicated.

The Draper Utah Temple will be the third temple to be dedicated in the Salt Lake Valley, the 12th in the state of Utah, and the 129th in the Church.

During the open-house period, over one million tickets have been requested and given out for the eight-week public open house. I have had the personal privilege of taking the media, interfaith groups, government officials, and my own family through this beautiful, new temple. As I have taken guests through the spacious baptistry, beautiful ordinance rooms, the holy celestial room, and sacred sealing rooms, I can tell you without any reservation that the Spirit of the Lord is already in this temple. It leaves a deep and wonderful impression on all who visit.

For those of you who have not made plans to visit the Draper Temple, I would invite you to do so today. You can still make reservations through the Church Web site (lds.org) and enjoy a wonderful opportunity with your friends and family in this most special and sacred place on earth, the house of the Lord.

On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, March 2022, 2009, the Draper Utah Temple will be formally dedicated by President Thomas S. Monson. Latter-day Saints in the area served by the new temple will attend 12 dedicatory sessions. After the dedication, the temple will serve approximately 60,000 members of the Church in Draper, Sandy, and surrounding communities.

Additionally, the First Presidency recently announced the dates for the new Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house and dedication. June 1 is the start of the eight-week open house. The dedication will be Friday through Sunday, August 1416, 2009. If you miss the Draper Temple open house, plan to visit the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house!

Temples are houses of the Lord, where our Saviors teachings are reaffirmed through sacred ordinances such as marriage, which unites families for all eternity. Sister Rasband, who is here with me today, and I were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on September 4, 1973, by her granduncle, Elder LeGrand Richards. On that occasion, Elder Richards, speaking to his niece, Sister Rasband, handed her the marriage certificate and said, "Melanie, here is the deed to your new property," meaning me! I have been safely in her watchful care ever since.

Years ago, at the Logan Temple cornerstone ceremony in 1877, President George Q. Cannon said this:

&lt;i&gt;Every foundation stone that is laid for a Temple, and every Temple completed . . . , lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our behalf, invokes and calls down upon us the blessings of the Eternal Gods, and those who reside in their presence.&lt;/i&gt; ["The Logan Temple," &lt;i&gt;Millennial Star&lt;/i&gt; 39, no. 46 (12 November 1877): 743]

Certainly in a day and time like we live in, the importance of every temple built and dedicated to the Lord cannot be overstated.

Concerning temple building, Brigham Young said in the early days of this work in Utah:

&lt;i&gt;To accomplish this work there will have to be not only one temple but thousands of them, and thousands and tens of thousands of men and women will go into those temples and officiate for people who have lived as far back as the Lord shall reveal.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 3:372]

Many years later, another of our latter-day prophets spoke of the importance of temple building. In 1980, President Ezra Taft Benson said this about temples:

&lt;i&gt;Our predecessors have prophesied that temples will dot the landscape of North and South America, the isles of the Pacific, Europe, and elsewhere. If this redemptive work is to be done on the scale it must be, hundreds of temples will be needed.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;TETB,&lt;/i&gt; 247]

At the time President Benson gave this message, there were 19 temples operating in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As President Gordon B. Hinckley became the prophet in 1995, early in his ministry he said this about his desire to see temples built and taken closer to the Latter-day Saints:

&lt;i&gt;I have in my heart a great burning desire, my brothers and sisters, to make it possible to have a temple where every faithful Latter-day Saint can come and receive his or her temple blessings, and have opportunity to extend those blessings to his or her forbears.&lt;/i&gt; ["Messages of Inspiration from President Hinckley," &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 4 May 1996, Z2]

When President Hinckley gave this message there were 47 temples operating in the Church.

I would suggest that one of the great legacies of President Gordon B. Hinckley is the number of temples that were built during his presidency. During his almost 13 years as our prophet there were 77 temples built and dedicated.

Now I ask you all, my dear brothers and sisters, to what end and to what purpose is all of this focus and emphasis on temple building? How does it apply to you at this stage of your life? As we consider this together, I am reminded of a passage of scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 52:14, which reads:

&lt;i&gt;And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.&lt;/i&gt;

I would recommend to you today that temple worship is an important pattern for each of you to set - individually and as families - as you consider your own areas of focus and attention, as you put in place firm foundations in your life. I know many of you already do this, and for that we are most grateful to you.

Let us ponder for a few moments some of the doctrine that has been revealed to us concerning temple worship. We know as Latter-day Saints that temple and family history work is one great work. We refer to the feelings that we can have in seeking out our departed ancestors as having the Spirit of Elijah. About this work President James E. Faust said:

&lt;i&gt;Searching for our kindred dead isnt just a hobby. It is a fundamental responsibility for all members of the Church. We believe that life continues after death and that all will be resurrected. We believe that families may continue in the next life if they have kept the special covenants made in one of the sacred temples under the authority of God. We believe that our deceased ancestors can also be eternally united with their families when we make covenants in their behalf in the temples. Our deceased forebears may accept these covenants, if they choose to do so, in the spirit world.&lt;/i&gt; ["The Phenomenon That Is You," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2003, 54]

A significant and wondrous prophecy was given by God to the ancient prophet Malachi some 400 years before the coming of Jesus Christ:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.&lt;/i&gt; [Malachi 4:56]

In this dispensation, the Lord spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith through His heavenly messenger Moroni. Joseph recorded the following concerning the evening of September 21, 1823, in his fathers home:

&lt;i&gt;While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;JS - H&lt;/i&gt; 1:30, 33]

The importance of this experience was emphasized with Moroni appearing four times and repeating the same message each time with some additions. Joseph recorded a portion of that experience as revelation in section 2 of the Doctrine and Covenants, chronologically the first section received:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 2:13]

When and where was this to happen? It had been over 2,200 years since Malachi first gave this prophecy. Direction came to Joseph Smith from the Lord, who instructed Joseph to build the first temple in this dispensation in Kirtland. This temple was built out of the poverty of the Saints, and shortly after its dedication the Lord came and accepted it. At that glorious time other heavenly manifestations also took place, including the fulfillment of the prophecy found in Malachi.

From section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, received in 1836, we read:

&lt;i&gt;After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi - testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 110:1316]

Since that remarkable day in 1836, through a continuation of the priesthood authority given to the Prophet Joseph, that power has been on the earth through prophets, seers, and revelators of the Church. We are so privileged to have President Thomas S. Monson as our prophet today. He holds that same priesthood authority that was given by Elijah to the Prophet Joseph in 1836. This is known as the sealing authority of God, by which we perform the sacred work in the temples today.

Let us ponder the importance of that experience at Kirtland and the sealing authority of God for each of us gathered here. This was stressed by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he declared: "The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead" (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 6:313). He also said, "Those Saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation" (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 4:426).

The First Presidency has issued an invitation to all the members of the Church, which certainly applies to you and me:

&lt;i&gt;Where time and circumstances permit, members are encouraged to replace some leisure activities with temple service. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"All of the ordinances which take place in the House of the Lord become expressions of our belief in that fundamental and basic doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. As we redouble our efforts and our faithfulness in going to the temple, the Lord will bless us."&lt;/i&gt; [Letter from the First Presidency, 11 March 2003; in "Encouraging Temple Worthiness and Preparation," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; June 2003, 76, and in &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; March 2004, 45]

As we, my young friends, consider righteous patterns that we want to establish in our lives, we all would be well to continue remembering this admonition from the First Presidency.

May we also consider the promised blessings by prophets, seers, and revelators as we faithfully attend the temple.

I would like to share a few of these promised blessings for our faithful service in the temple. First, from President Gordon B. Hinckley:

&lt;i&gt;I would hope that we might go to the house of the Lord a little more frequently. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . I encourage you to take greater advantage of this blessed privilege. It will refine your natures. It will peel off the selfish shell in which most of us live. It will literally bring a sanctifying element into our lives and make us better men and better women.&lt;/i&gt; ["Closing Remarks," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2004, 104, 105]

He also promised:

&lt;i&gt;If there were more temple work done in the Church, there would be less of selfishness, less of contention, less of demeaning others. The whole Church would increasingly be lifted to greater heights of spirituality, love for one another, and obedience to the commandments of God.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;TGBH,&lt;/i&gt; 622]

Now let me share a quote from President James E. Faust:

&lt;i&gt;We unavoidably stand in so many unholy places and are subjected to so much that is vulgar, profane, and destructive of the Spirit of the Lord that I encourage our Saints all over the world, wherever possible, to strive to stand more often in holy places. Our most holy places are our sacred temples. Within them is a feeling of sacred comfort.&lt;/i&gt; ["Standing in Holy Places," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2005, 62]

And from President Thomas S. Monson comes this promise:

&lt;i&gt;Come to the temple and place your burdens before the Lord and youll be filled with a new spirit and confidence in the future. Trust in the Lord, and if you do Hell hold you and cradle you and lead you step by step along that pathway that leads to the celestial kingdom of God.&lt;/i&gt; [Quoted in Dell Van Orden, "San Diego Temple: 45th House of the Lord Dedicated in Season for Temple Building," &lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 8 May 1993, Z8]

Brothers and sisters, another comforting blessing of temple worship is the assurance of protection and peace from the storm that is upon us in our day.

I think of a promise given in the Book of Mormon through Ammon in the book of Alma. Speaking of where members will be gathered into the garners, or temples of the Lord, he said:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 26:6; see also verse 5]

I bear my testimony, brothers and sisters, that some of the safest places that Heavenly Father has established for the gathering of His people are in the temples of the Lord. I invite you to the Draper Utah Temple open house - or the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house that will follow this summer - to experience anew the feeling that you receive in these temples of the Lord.

More important, I invite you, as has the First Presidency, to make temple worship a pattern in your life. Most all of you in this congregation can participate in the temple in one way or another. Most all of you can perform baptisms for the dead. Many of you who are endowed can perform washings and anointings, endowments, and sealings - first for yourselves and then for others living on the other side of the veil who are waiting for you and me to serve as proxies for them in this great redemptive work.

President Hinckley taught:

&lt;i&gt;Now, Id like to submit to you that when all is said and done, the work and the mission of this Church is to save. Its just that simple and just that profound . . . to save people. Thats the whole purpose of what we are doing. Thats why we have home teachers. Thats why we have visiting teachers. Thats why we have classes. Thats why we have sacrament meeting. Thats why we build temples, to save the living and the dead. Thats our work.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;TGBH,&lt;/i&gt; 119]

The statement on the outside facade of every temple reads: "Holiness to the Lord / The House of the Lord." I testify that all of the temples of the Lord are His sanctuaries here upon the earth. I invite all of you to attend more frequently, as your circumstances permit, and claim your blessings and protections that have been promised to you by prophets of God. Jesus Christ lives. This is His Church. This service in temples is rolling forward throughout the earth - as prophets throughout the ages have seen in vision and prophecy - to bless the lives of the Latter-day Saints and carry out the work of redeeming the dead.

I know that President Thomas S. Monson is Gods prophet upon the earth today and holds the sealing power of God, the same authority that was given to Joseph Smith by the prophet Elijah in the Kirtland Temple. It is by that authority that new families are created and sealed together for time and all eternity - so unlike that which is done out in the world relative to the divine institution of marriage.

I pray the Lord will bless each of us here today with a greater desire and greater intent to hearken unto the words of the living prophets and attend the temple.

I leave my testimony and reaffirm these prophetic blessings to all of you today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Thank you, President Samuelson, for that warm and friendly introduction. Sister Rasband and I are deeply honored to be here today to participate in this devotional.</p>
<p>We are grateful to have had all five of our own children, and some of their spouses, attend Brigham Young University and are pleased to have several of them, as well as other members of our extended family and dear friends, here in the audience with us today.</p>
<p>The year 2009 will be a historic year for the Church in Utah as we participate in the cultural events, open houses, and dedications of the Draper Utah and Oquirrh Mountain Utah temples in the Salt Lake Valley. These significant events are wonderful reminders and opportunities for us to inspire and strengthen each other in our personal commitment to attend the temple and worship there on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As we gather here this morning on the campus of Brigham Young University, thousands of members and many of those not of our faith are walking through the Draper Utah Temple, as the open house is under way for an eight-week period prior to the dedication. Obviously there is an extremely high interest among our members and friends to walk through this beautiful, new temple and experience the beauty, spirit, and inspiration that come with such a visit. This is the first temple open house in the Salt Lake Valley since 1981, when the Jordan River Temple had an open house and was dedicated.</p>
<p>The Draper Utah Temple will be the third temple to be dedicated in the Salt Lake Valley, the 12th in the state of Utah, and the 129th in the Church.</p>
<p>During the open-house period, over one million tickets have been requested and given out for the eight-week public open house. I have had the personal privilege of taking the media, interfaith groups, government officials, and my own family through this beautiful, new temple. As I have taken guests through the spacious baptistry, beautiful ordinance rooms, the holy celestial room, and sacred sealing rooms, I can tell you without any reservation that the Spirit of the Lord is already in this temple. It leaves a deep and wonderful impression on all who visit.</p>
<p>For those of you who have not made plans to visit the Draper Temple, I would invite you to do so today. You can still make reservations through the Church Web site (lds.org) and enjoy a wonderful opportunity with your friends and family in this most special and sacred place on earth, the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, March 2022, 2009, the Draper Utah Temple will be formally dedicated by President Thomas S. Monson. Latter-day Saints in the area served by the new temple will attend 12 dedicatory sessions. After the dedication, the temple will serve approximately 60,000 members of the Church in Draper, Sandy, and surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the First Presidency recently announced the dates for the new Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house and dedication. June 1 is the start of the eight-week open house. The dedication will be Friday through Sunday, August 1416, 2009. If you miss the Draper Temple open house, plan to visit the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house!</p>
<p>Temples are houses of the Lord, where our Saviors teachings are reaffirmed through sacred ordinances such as marriage, which unites families for all eternity. Sister Rasband, who is here with me today, and I were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on September 4, 1973, by her granduncle, Elder LeGrand Richards. On that occasion, Elder Richards, speaking to his niece, Sister Rasband, handed her the marriage certificate and said, "Melanie, here is the deed to your new property," meaning me! I have been safely in her watchful care ever since.</p>
<p>Years ago, at the Logan Temple cornerstone ceremony in 1877, President George Q. Cannon said this:</p>
<p><i>Every foundation stone that is laid for a Temple, and every Temple completed . . . , lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our behalf, invokes and calls down upon us the blessings of the Eternal Gods, and those who reside in their presence.</i> ["The Logan Temple," <i>Millennial Star</i> 39, no. 46 (12 November 1877): 743]</p>
<p>Certainly in a day and time like we live in, the importance of every temple built and dedicated to the Lord cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Concerning temple building, Brigham Young said in the early days of this work in Utah:</p>
<p><i>To accomplish this work there will have to be not only one temple but thousands of them, and thousands and tens of thousands of men and women will go into those temples and officiate for people who have lived as far back as the Lord shall reveal.</i> [<i>JD</i> 3:372]</p>
<p>Many years later, another of our latter-day prophets spoke of the importance of temple building. In 1980, President Ezra Taft Benson said this about temples:</p>
<p><i>Our predecessors have prophesied that temples will dot the landscape of North and South America, the isles of the Pacific, Europe, and elsewhere. If this redemptive work is to be done on the scale it must be, hundreds of temples will be needed.</i> [<i>TETB,</i> 247]</p>
<p>At the time President Benson gave this message, there were 19 temples operating in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>As President Gordon B. Hinckley became the prophet in 1995, early in his ministry he said this about his desire to see temples built and taken closer to the Latter-day Saints:</p>
<p><i>I have in my heart a great burning desire, my brothers and sisters, to make it possible to have a temple where every faithful Latter-day Saint can come and receive his or her temple blessings, and have opportunity to extend those blessings to his or her forbears.</i> ["Messages of Inspiration from President Hinckley," <i>Church News,</i> 4 May 1996, Z2]</p>
<p>When President Hinckley gave this message there were 47 temples operating in the Church.</p>
<p>I would suggest that one of the great legacies of President Gordon B. Hinckley is the number of temples that were built during his presidency. During his almost 13 years as our prophet there were 77 temples built and dedicated.</p>
<p>Now I ask you all, my dear brothers and sisters, to what end and to what purpose is all of this focus and emphasis on temple building? How does it apply to you at this stage of your life? As we consider this together, I am reminded of a passage of scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 52:14, which reads:</p>
<p><i>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.</i></p>
<p>I would recommend to you today that temple worship is an important pattern for each of you to set - individually and as families - as you consider your own areas of focus and attention, as you put in place firm foundations in your life. I know many of you already do this, and for that we are most grateful to you.</p>
<p>Let us ponder for a few moments some of the doctrine that has been revealed to us concerning temple worship. We know as Latter-day Saints that temple and family history work is one great work. We refer to the feelings that we can have in seeking out our departed ancestors as having the Spirit of Elijah. About this work President James E. Faust said:</p>
<p><i>Searching for our kindred dead isnt just a hobby. It is a fundamental responsibility for all members of the Church. We believe that life continues after death and that all will be resurrected. We believe that families may continue in the next life if they have kept the special covenants made in one of the sacred temples under the authority of God. We believe that our deceased ancestors can also be eternally united with their families when we make covenants in their behalf in the temples. Our deceased forebears may accept these covenants, if they choose to do so, in the spirit world.</i> ["The Phenomenon That Is You," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2003, 54]</p>
<p>A significant and wondrous prophecy was given by God to the ancient prophet Malachi some 400 years before the coming of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p><i>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</i></p>
<p><i>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</i> [Malachi 4:56]</p>
<p>In this dispensation, the Lord spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith through His heavenly messenger Moroni. Joseph recorded the following concerning the evening of September 21, 1823, in his fathers home:</p>
<p><i>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni.</i> [<i>JS - H</i> 1:30, 33]</p>
<p>The importance of this experience was emphasized with Moroni appearing four times and repeating the same message each time with some additions. Joseph recorded a portion of that experience as revelation in section 2 of the Doctrine and Covenants, chronologically the first section received:</p>
<p><i>Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i></p>
<p><i>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i> [D&amp;C 2:13]</p>
<p>When and where was this to happen? It had been over 2,200 years since Malachi first gave this prophecy. Direction came to Joseph Smith from the Lord, who instructed Joseph to build the first temple in this dispensation in Kirtland. This temple was built out of the poverty of the Saints, and shortly after its dedication the Lord came and accepted it. At that glorious time other heavenly manifestations also took place, including the fulfillment of the prophecy found in Malachi.</p>
<p>From section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, received in 1836, we read:</p>
<p><i>After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:</i></p>
<p><i>Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi - testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come - </i></p>
<p><i>To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse - </i></p>
<p><i>Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.</i> [D&amp;C 110:1316]</p>
<p>Since that remarkable day in 1836, through a continuation of the priesthood authority given to the Prophet Joseph, that power has been on the earth through prophets, seers, and revelators of the Church. We are so privileged to have President Thomas S. Monson as our prophet today. He holds that same priesthood authority that was given by Elijah to the Prophet Joseph in 1836. This is known as the sealing authority of God, by which we perform the sacred work in the temples today.</p>
<p>Let us ponder the importance of that experience at Kirtland and the sealing authority of God for each of us gathered here. This was stressed by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he declared: "The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead" (<i>HC</i> 6:313). He also said, "Those Saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation" (<i>HC</i> 4:426).</p>
<p>The First Presidency has issued an invitation to all the members of the Church, which certainly applies to you and me:</p>
<p><i>Where time and circumstances permit, members are encouraged to replace some leisure activities with temple service. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>"All of the ordinances which take place in the House of the Lord become expressions of our belief in that fundamental and basic doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. As we redouble our efforts and our faithfulness in going to the temple, the Lord will bless us."</i> [Letter from the First Presidency, 11 March 2003; in "Encouraging Temple Worthiness and Preparation," <i>Ensign,</i> June 2003, 76, and in <i>Ensign,</i> March 2004, 45]</p>
<p>As we, my young friends, consider righteous patterns that we want to establish in our lives, we all would be well to continue remembering this admonition from the First Presidency.</p>
<p>May we also consider the promised blessings by prophets, seers, and revelators as we faithfully attend the temple.</p>
<p>I would like to share a few of these promised blessings for our faithful service in the temple. First, from President Gordon B. Hinckley:</p>
<p><i>I would hope that we might go to the house of the Lord a little more frequently. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . I encourage you to take greater advantage of this blessed privilege. It will refine your natures. It will peel off the selfish shell in which most of us live. It will literally bring a sanctifying element into our lives and make us better men and better women.</i> ["Closing Remarks," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 104, 105]</p>
<p>He also promised:</p>
<p><i>If there were more temple work done in the Church, there would be less of selfishness, less of contention, less of demeaning others. The whole Church would increasingly be lifted to greater heights of spirituality, love for one another, and obedience to the commandments of God.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 622]</p>
<p>Now let me share a quote from President James E. Faust:</p>
<p><i>We unavoidably stand in so many unholy places and are subjected to so much that is vulgar, profane, and destructive of the Spirit of the Lord that I encourage our Saints all over the world, wherever possible, to strive to stand more often in holy places. Our most holy places are our sacred temples. Within them is a feeling of sacred comfort.</i> ["Standing in Holy Places," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 62]</p>
<p>And from President Thomas S. Monson comes this promise:</p>
<p><i>Come to the temple and place your burdens before the Lord and youll be filled with a new spirit and confidence in the future. Trust in the Lord, and if you do Hell hold you and cradle you and lead you step by step along that pathway that leads to the celestial kingdom of God.</i> [Quoted in Dell Van Orden, "San Diego Temple: 45th House of the Lord Dedicated in Season for Temple Building," <i>Church News,</i> 8 May 1993, Z8]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, another comforting blessing of temple worship is the assurance of protection and peace from the storm that is upon us in our day.</p>
<p>I think of a promise given in the Book of Mormon through Ammon in the book of Alma. Speaking of where members will be gathered into the garners, or temples of the Lord, he said:</p>
<p><i>Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</i> [Alma 26:6; see also verse 5]</p>
<p>I bear my testimony, brothers and sisters, that some of the safest places that Heavenly Father has established for the gathering of His people are in the temples of the Lord. I invite you to the Draper Utah Temple open house - or the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house that will follow this summer - to experience anew the feeling that you receive in these temples of the Lord.</p>
<p>More important, I invite you, as has the First Presidency, to make temple worship a pattern in your life. Most all of you in this congregation can participate in the temple in one way or another. Most all of you can perform baptisms for the dead. Many of you who are endowed can perform washings and anointings, endowments, and sealings - first for yourselves and then for others living on the other side of the veil who are waiting for you and me to serve as proxies for them in this great redemptive work.</p>
<p>President Hinckley taught:</p>
<p><i>Now, Id like to submit to you that when all is said and done, the work and the mission of this Church is to save. Its just that simple and just that profound . . . to save people. Thats the whole purpose of what we are doing. Thats why we have home teachers. Thats why we have visiting teachers. Thats why we have classes. Thats why we have sacrament meeting. Thats why we build temples, to save the living and the dead. Thats our work.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 119]</p>
<p>The statement on the outside facade of every temple reads: "Holiness to the Lord / The House of the Lord." I testify that all of the temples of the Lord are His sanctuaries here upon the earth. I invite all of you to attend more frequently, as your circumstances permit, and claim your blessings and protections that have been promised to you by prophets of God. Jesus Christ lives. This is His Church. This service in temples is rolling forward throughout the earth - as prophets throughout the ages have seen in vision and prophecy - to bless the lives of the Latter-day Saints and carry out the work of redeeming the dead.</p>
<p>I know that President Thomas S. Monson is Gods prophet upon the earth today and holds the sealing power of God, the same authority that was given to Joseph Smith by the prophet Elijah in the Kirtland Temple. It is by that authority that new families are created and sealed together for time and all eternity - so unlike that which is done out in the world relative to the divine institution of marriage.</p>
<p>I pray the Lord will bless each of us here today with a greater desire and greater intent to hearken unto the words of the living prophets and attend the temple.</p>
<p>I leave my testimony and reaffirm these prophetic blessings to all of you today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, I am humbled to stand before you. Many of you will know that the First Presidency originally assigned Elder L. Tom Perry to speak here today. I am honored to stand in his place.
In the past ninety days we have witnessed, as President Russell M. Nelson likes to say, "the graduation" of two extraordinary Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. President Boyd K. Packer was made a General Authority just after my tenth birthday. Elder L. Tom Perry was ordained an Apostle before my wife, Kathy, and I were married, when we were students here at Brigham Young University. For more than forty years they sat together in the Quorum of the Twelve, and for more than half of that time they sat next to one another. President Packer, with a smile, would say that the Lord put Elder Perry next to him to kick him in the ankles when he got out of line.
During those many decades they moved across the world and used every opportunity to testify of the divine mission of the Lord Jesus Christ and of the restoration of His gospel. And as they bore witness of Him, He refined them, purified them, and sanctified them. President Packer, who was by his nature a very private man, would lament at times that members of the Quorum of the Twelve were destined to die onstage.
President Packer had a very quick wit. One Thursday morning before our meeting began in the temple, Elder Perry was conversing with me at the junior end of the semicircle of chairs. President Packer, speaking in a cheerful voice so all could hear, said, "Tom, come up here where you belong. Ten good men have died to put you in this chair."
They both moved through the veil with dignity and spiritual power.
On the week that Elder Perry passed away, he attended our meeting on Tuesday. On Tuesday night, as recorded by his son, Lee, he had a spiritual experience that let him know his time was soon.1
With Elder Russell M. Nelson on assignment in eastern Europe, Elder Perry, on Wednesday morning, called Elder Oaks and Elder Ballard to his apartment. He told them his time was short and that he would not be coming back into the office. He recorded a six-minute message for the Quorum of the Twelve, telling us he loved us, encouraging us in the work ahead, and bearing his sure witness of the Savior. We were sobered as that recording was played for us Thursday morning in the temple.
The First Presidency went Thursday afternoon to say their good-byes to their dear friend. Elder Nelson called Elder Perry from Bulgaria Thursday evening. On Friday morning President Packer rose from his feeble condition and traveled to Elder Perrys apartment to say good-bye. They reflected on their many years together. President Packer reminded him that Elder Perry had always said that he wanted to go through the veil at least one day before President Packer. They rejoiced that they would soon see each other on the other side.
On Friday af</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a joy to be here at the Brigham Young University devotional. As you know, this is a very special place of learning. While you are at Brigham Young University, you are learning and preparing for your future - to support yourselves spiritually and temporally; to establish a means for providing for your families; and to use your time, talents, and other resources to serve the Lord and lift and strengthen His children.
I have pondered many subjects to teach during this devotional and have been impressed to talk about the importance of temple preparation and of having an eternal perspective during our mortal probation here on earth. The temple endowment blessings are as essential for each of us as was our baptism. For this reason we are to prepare ourselves that we may be clean to enter into the temple of God. Temple work is an opportunity to perform our personal endowments and covenants for the living and also perform these same ordinances for the redemption for the dead. It is for this reason we are instructed in the scriptures to build temples and prepare our lives to be worthy to partake of the sacred temple ordinances and covenants.
We have been taught in the scriptures that the personal worthiness required of us by the Lord to enter the temple and to take upon us the sacred covenants therein is one of the greatest blessings available to us in mortality. Then, after taking upon us the covenants in the temple, our obedience in living the covenants daily is a demonstration of our faith, love, devotion, and spiritual commitment to honor our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ and prepares us to live with Them in the eternities. The temples saving ordinances are essential to - and even the central focus of - the eternal plan of happiness.
Today I want to discuss the doctrine of the temple, the effects of the temple doctrine in your life, and the ways that you can prepare yourselves - and, we hope, your eternal companions can prepare themselves - to partake of the full blessings of the holy temple in mortality and in eternal life.
The Temple Doctrine
We need to acquire a testimony and a reverent feeling of the temple being the house of the Lord. The temple is truly a place where you are "in the world and not of the world." When you are troubled and when you have crucial decisions that weigh heavily on your mind and soul, you can take your cares to the temple and receive spiritual guidance.
To preserve the sanctity of the temple so that the temple may be kept pure and to invite the Spirit to bless those who enter the holy temple for their ordinances and covenants, we are taught that no unclean thing should enter the temple. Reverence in the temple is a vital element in inviting the Spirit to reside within it every hour of every day.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Sister Bateman and I are particularly pleased to welcome you to the new 20022003 school year at Brigham Young University. Normally the two of us share the podium during the devotionals. Because of a health challenge, Sister Bateman has asked that I represent the two of us today. We have been sweethearts for more than 40 years. Her experience during the last month has reinforced in my mind and heart how much she means to me and our family. Our prayers have become prayers of thankfulness. We are grateful that she is on the mend.
We extend a special welcome this morning to more than 5,000 new freshmen admitted to the university. We also welcome 3,500 returning missionaries, 1,500 transfer students, and 20,000 students returning from last year. You come from all 50 states and more than 110 countries and represent the peoples, languages, and cultures of the world. In addition, you understand the most important language of all - that of the Spirit.
Recently BYU received the results of a national survey rating universities according to five important "learning" categories. The purpose of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) is to measure the quality of academics at the various colleges and universities in America. Brigham Young University ranks high in all five areas. We are rated at the 99th percentile as one of the most "supportive campus environments" in the United States. This is the second year in a row in which BYU is a benchmark school. We are at the 91st percentile with regard to the "level of academic challenge." This means that BYUs academic expectations are among the highest in the nation.
This is important information for two reasons. First, it reflects the quality of the extraordinary faculty and staff at the university. Second, it is a warning - especially to freshmen and transfers - that the standards are high and you must put forth your best effort. You have been admitted because we believe you can succeed in this special environment, but it will require daily effort on your part. In high school it might have been possible for some to wait until the day before the examination to study. For those who procrastinate here, 19 out of 20 will not perform satisfactorily. A great many of you were "A" students before coming. This is a very competitive but supportive environment. All can succeed, but you must study two to three hours outside of class for every hour in class. I promise each of you that if you will be diligent in your studies, ask questions, and meet with faculty when you do not understand, you will have an incredible learning experience here.
In a different survey that has a much longer history, the university once again was named the number-one "stone-cold sober" school (see The Best 345 Colleges[New York: Random House/Princeton Review, 2002]; also see "The Best 345 College Rankings" at http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingT</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The dawn of a new millennium and the dusk of an old provide an opportunity to review key events and accomplishments of the recent past and ask what the future may hold. I realize that some believe the transition from one century and millennium to the next will occur at the end of the year 2000. For others who like to celebrate good things twice, the trial run has just been completed. And for those who base their counting on a multiplicity of zeroes, the new millennium has arrived. Regardless of how one counts, we "stand on the summit of the ages." In the October 1999 general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of standing "on the summit of the ages, awed by a great and solemn sense of history" ("At the Summit of the Ages," Ensign, November 1999, 74). With eloquence he said:
What an exciting and wonderful thing it is to step across the threshold of the centuries. . . . Even more exciting is our opportunity to bridge the millennium that is drawing to a close and greet a new thousand years. [Hinckley, "Summit," 72]
He continued:
For some reason unknown to us, but in the wisdom of God, we have been privileged to come to earth in this glorious age. There has been a great flowering of science. There has been a veritable explosion of learning. This is the greatest of all ages of human endeavor and human accomplishment. And more importantly, it is the season when God has spoken, when His Beloved Son has appeared, when the divine priesthood has been restored, when we hold in our hand another testament of the Son of God. What a glorious and wonderful day this is. [Hinckley, "Summit," 74]
There is an adage that says, "One does not see the future by looking in a rearview mirror." In contrast, there is another that declares: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" (George Santayana, "Flux and Constancy in Human Nature," in Reason in Common Sense, vol. 1 of The Life of Reason [New York: Charles Scribners Sons, 19051906], 284). For a moment I wish to remind us of some of the spiritual and temporal high points since Joseph Smiths day and then look forward to the new century in anticipation of what lies ahead. We are fortunate to have prophets and apostles who are seers - servants who have provided us with a road map for the future. It is instructive to see what the Lord has said through them regarding the years ahead.
Some Highlights from the Last Two Centuries
Since the dawn of time, prophets have spoken of two special periods in the history of the earth. The first is the meridian of time, a time when the Son of God was born, ministered to His people, suffered death, and was resurrected. Moses, Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, and numerous other prophets of the Old Testament foretold of this special season when the Son of God made the earth His footstool. It has now been 2,000 years sinc</span>
