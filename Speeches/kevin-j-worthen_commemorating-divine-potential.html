  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="This is my first graduation ceremony as president of the university. As you might imagine, I have given a little thought to what graduation ceremonies are all about.

In some respects, a graduation ceremony is a rather odd event. While the graduation ceremony had its origins in Europe, it is now largely an American phenomenon. As Robert Pippin, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago, once noted on a similar occasion:

&lt;i&gt;All modern developed nations have universities and some sort of procedure or exam for marking the end of study, but virtually no other nation in the world has graduation ceremonies (the exception is some in England). . . . We Americans, uniquely in all the world, are crazy about such ceremonies. We even have them . . . for graduation from kindergarten, first grade, fourth grade, eighth grade, high school, driving school, secretarial school, dog obedience school, and so on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

To make the matter even more odd, even though this is mostly an American ceremony, we dress in ways that hardly any Americans - except perhaps priests, judges, or individuals we would consider to be deranged - would ever think about dressing.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The ceremonial garb we wear today did at one point have some practical significance. In medieval Europe many ordinary people wore long-sleeved gowns or robes to provide warmth in poorly heated buildings. They also wore hoods, which they could pull over their heads when it became too cold.

Over time, distinctive gowns and hoods were developed for the various professions, trades, and religious orders. Because most of the professors at early universities in Italy, France, and England were clerics, formal academic wear came to resemble that of the early clergy.

However, once someone figured out how to heat buildings properly, most people abandoned the gown-and-hood look for something more practical. Status conscious as they were, academics "still tried to mark themselves off as in a special group," as Professor Pippin noted, and faculty and students at most universities "continued to attend class and teach in what had by then . . . become the basic university attire, the black gown."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

By the end of the nineteenth century practicality overcame status symbols, and the practice of wearing academic robes to class every day slowly died out, even in America. However, Americans continued to hang on to the tradition of donning the garb for graduation ceremonies. And, in typical American fashion, marketing forces soon began to influence the practice. Professor Pippin explained:

&lt;i&gt;Mr. Gardner Cottrell Leonard, a young man of industry and sound commercial sense, . . . had not been happy with the shape and fit of his graduation gown, worn at Williams College in 1883, and he spent the next year traveling across Europe, researching medieval attire and the design of gowns and hats. For the next ten years or so, he had developed and promoted the business of designing and supplying such gowns, and when a meeting of college officials was held at Columbia in 1895 to decide on uniform standards . . . , Mr. Leonard was the technical expert . . . and very successful promoter of all this regalia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

The standards set at that meeting were revised over time, and there is today - and I am not making this up - an academic costume code that prescribes the style of the sleeves, the nature of the material, the color of the hood and width of its binding, and the type and color of the tassel, all according to the institution and the degree awarded.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

So here we sit - or, I guess, there you sit and here I stand - "dressed," in the words of Professor Pippin, "like thirteenth-century monks thanks partly to the marketing skills of the son of a dry goods manufacturer in Albany, New York" in the late 1800s.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; And we do so in order to go through a ceremony largely abandoned by the rest of the modern world. How does one explain this?

Anthropologists, philosophers, sociologists, and, I suppose, even psychologists could provide a variety of interesting answers to that question. Let me offer just one.

I suggest we are willing to endure what might seem like an odd custom because ceremonies help us mark transition points in our lives, making it clear to us (and to others) that we have finished one important phase of our lives and are now entering another. Thus we celebrate not only what you have accomplished here in the past few years but, more important, the fact that you are moving on to a new stage of life in which - because of what you have experienced and learned here - you will be prepared to accomplish even more. That is the reason why - even though you are finishing your formal education here - this ceremony is called a commencement rather than a termination.

Almost all societies have some kind of ceremony (either formal or informal) to mark life-stage transitions. Ceremonies like this one help us reflect on what we have learned and on how that learning has prepared us for the challenges that lie ahead.

As you ponder on those matters today, let me suggest that, as someone once observed, "the question to be asked at the end of an educational step or sequence is not what has the student learned but what has the student become."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

As I am sure you have already discovered - and if you have not, you soon will - there is a vast difference between knowing something and doing something. You may understand the theoretical principles of physics, for example, and still not be able to construct a rocket ship. The gap between theory and practice is sometimes wide.

But the observation goes one step further, drawing a contrast not just between knowing and doing but also between doing and being. That distinction is particularly important at a university like this one whose mission is not just to convey knowledge to students but also "to assist [them] in their quest for perfection and eternal life."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

In the long run, your success at BYU - and your success in the next phases of your life - will be measured not by what you have learned from some textbook. You will soon forget much of that, if it wasnt forgotten the minute you walked out of the final. Nor will your success be determined solely by what you have done here. Your grade point average, for example, will matter less and less as time goes on. (For some that is good news.) Your success, here and beyond, will ultimately be measured by what you become, by your character. The real question to be asked at a ceremony of this kind is "How close are we to reaching our full potential?" The BYU mission statement indicates that this is a place where "the full realization of human potential is pursued."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; And that potential is greater than many in the world imagine, because all human beings are "beloved spirit son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

As important and as powerful as it is to learn some truth or to do some good act, it is much more important to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; true and to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; good. If you become a true and good spouse, parent, child, sibling, co-worker, or friend - and ultimately realize your divine potential as sons and daughters of heavenly parents - your higher education that has begun but not ended here will be a true success. Reminding ourselves of these truths and that potential is reason aplenty to engage in this distinctive ceremony. May each of you realize that full potential is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>This is my first graduation ceremony as president of the university. As you might imagine, I have given a little thought to what graduation ceremonies are all about.</p>
<p>In some respects, a graduation ceremony is a rather odd event. While the graduation ceremony had its origins in Europe, it is now largely an American phenomenon. As Robert Pippin, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago, once noted on a similar occasion:</p>
<p><i>All modern developed nations have universities and some sort of procedure or exam for marking the end of study, but virtually no other nation in the world has graduation ceremonies (the exception is some in England). . . . We Americans, uniquely in all the world, are crazy about such ceremonies. We even have them . . . for graduation from kindergarten, first grade, fourth grade, eighth grade, high school, driving school, secretarial school, dog obedience school, and so on.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>To make the matter even more odd, even though this is mostly an American ceremony, we dress in ways that hardly any Americans - except perhaps priests, judges, or individuals we would consider to be deranged - would ever think about dressing.<sup>2</sup> The ceremonial garb we wear today did at one point have some practical significance. In medieval Europe many ordinary people wore long-sleeved gowns or robes to provide warmth in poorly heated buildings. They also wore hoods, which they could pull over their heads when it became too cold.</p>
<p>Over time, distinctive gowns and hoods were developed for the various professions, trades, and religious orders. Because most of the professors at early universities in Italy, France, and England were clerics, formal academic wear came to resemble that of the early clergy.</p>
<p>However, once someone figured out how to heat buildings properly, most people abandoned the gown-and-hood look for something more practical. Status conscious as they were, academics "still tried to mark themselves off as in a special group," as Professor Pippin noted, and faculty and students at most universities "continued to attend class and teach in what had by then . . . become the basic university attire, the black gown."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century practicality overcame status symbols, and the practice of wearing academic robes to class every day slowly died out, even in America. However, Americans continued to hang on to the tradition of donning the garb for graduation ceremonies. And, in typical American fashion, marketing forces soon began to influence the practice. Professor Pippin explained:</p>
<p><i>Mr. Gardner Cottrell Leonard, a young man of industry and sound commercial sense, . . . had not been happy with the shape and fit of his graduation gown, worn at Williams College in 1883, and he spent the next year traveling across Europe, researching medieval attire and the design of gowns and hats. For the next ten years or so, he had developed and promoted the business of designing and supplying such gowns, and when a meeting of college officials was held at Columbia in 1895 to decide on uniform standards . . . , Mr. Leonard was the technical expert . . . and very successful promoter of all this regalia.</i><sup>4</sup></p>
<p>The standards set at that meeting were revised over time, and there is today - and I am not making this up - an academic costume code that prescribes the style of the sleeves, the nature of the material, the color of the hood and width of its binding, and the type and color of the tassel, all according to the institution and the degree awarded.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>So here we sit - or, I guess, there you sit and here I stand - "dressed," in the words of Professor Pippin, "like thirteenth-century monks thanks partly to the marketing skills of the son of a dry goods manufacturer in Albany, New York" in the late 1800s.<sup>6</sup> And we do so in order to go through a ceremony largely abandoned by the rest of the modern world. How does one explain this?</p>
<p>Anthropologists, philosophers, sociologists, and, I suppose, even psychologists could provide a variety of interesting answers to that question. Let me offer just one.</p>
<p>I suggest we are willing to endure what might seem like an odd custom because ceremonies help us mark transition points in our lives, making it clear to us (and to others) that we have finished one important phase of our lives and are now entering another. Thus we celebrate not only what you have accomplished here in the past few years but, more important, the fact that you are moving on to a new stage of life in which - because of what you have experienced and learned here - you will be prepared to accomplish even more. That is the reason why - even though you are finishing your formal education here - this ceremony is called a commencement rather than a termination.</p>
<p>Almost all societies have some kind of ceremony (either formal or informal) to mark life-stage transitions. Ceremonies like this one help us reflect on what we have learned and on how that learning has prepared us for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>As you ponder on those matters today, let me suggest that, as someone once observed, "the question to be asked at the end of an educational step or sequence is not what has the student learned but what has the student become."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>As I am sure you have already discovered - and if you have not, you soon will - there is a vast difference between knowing something and doing something. You may understand the theoretical principles of physics, for example, and still not be able to construct a rocket ship. The gap between theory and practice is sometimes wide.</p>
<p>But the observation goes one step further, drawing a contrast not just between knowing and doing but also between doing and being. That distinction is particularly important at a university like this one whose mission is not just to convey knowledge to students but also "to assist [them] in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>In the long run, your success at BYU - and your success in the next phases of your life - will be measured not by what you have learned from some textbook. You will soon forget much of that, if it wasnt forgotten the minute you walked out of the final. Nor will your success be determined solely by what you have done here. Your grade point average, for example, will matter less and less as time goes on. (For some that is good news.) Your success, here and beyond, will ultimately be measured by what you become, by your character. The real question to be asked at a ceremony of this kind is "How close are we to reaching our full potential?" The BYU mission statement indicates that this is a place where "the full realization of human potential is pursued."<sup>9</sup> And that potential is greater than many in the world imagine, because all human beings are "beloved spirit son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>As important and as powerful as it is to learn some truth or to do some good act, it is much more important to <i>be</i> true and to <i>be</i> good. If you become a true and good spouse, parent, child, sibling, co-worker, or friend - and ultimately realize your divine potential as sons and daughters of heavenly parents - your higher education that has begun but not ended here will be a true success. Reminding ourselves of these truths and that potential is reason aplenty to engage in this distinctive ceremony. May each of you realize that full potential is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My beloved brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you today. I love this university for many reasons - not the least of these is the fact that I attended school here, as did my wife, our five children, and four of five of their spouses. I suppose you could say that I have a personal, financial investment in this university.
I love that so many wonderful, intelligent disciples of the Savior come to this campus to dedicate themselves to the pursuit of truth and to seek temporal and spiritual knowledge.
I have already said that I love this university. What I didnt tell you was that I also carry fond feelings for this building in which we are seated today.
As I was watching students enter the building this morning, it brought back a flood of memories. For a moment it seemed as though time had rolled back, and I could see myself as a student your age, entering this very building.
However, in my case, the reason I most often entered this building was to work the midnight cleanup shift here at the Marriott Activities Center. If you look around, you will see the very places I walked with broom and mop, tidying up after devotionals, basketball games, and special events. So for those of you who might be tempted to litter while you are here, please keep in mind that I will be watching.
This campus is sacred. While I worked and studied here, I also pondered questions that many of you might be asking at this time of your life:
 What should I study?
 What will become of me?
 Does the Lord care which career I choose?
 Will I ever meet someone, fall in love, and get married?
 Will I find happiness and success in life?
I have to tell you that these questions felt all consuming and even frightening at times. I honestly didnt know exactly where my life would go when I was your age. One thing is certain: I never imagined as I was sweeping this great hall that one day I would be at this pulpit speaking to you.
Today I want to address two of the questions you might be asking - things I myself desperately wanted to know when I was your age.
First, if you dedicate your life to Gods service, will He direct your steps and use you for His righteous purposes?
Second, if you choose to follow the Savior and walk in the path of discipleship, will the Lord watch over you, guide you, bless you, and fill you with a spirit of joy and fulfillment?
A Temple in Philadelphia
In the ten years prior to my being called to the Presiding Bishopric, I had the blessing and privilege of helping to identify and acquire sites for temples.
A few years ago President Thomas S. Monson announced that there would be a temple in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, so we went to work researching possible sites where that temple could be built. Two sites ultimately emerged - and it just so happened that they were across the street from each o</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to each of the graduates today. Graduation is properly a time of celebration - a time to rejoice in the success you have all achieved in earning your degree. It is also properly a time to look forward to what lies ahead - that is in part why we call this ceremony a commencement.
Many of you will go immediately into your first post-college full-time job. Others will head to graduate school. Some will dedicate themselves to the full-time pursuit of raising children. Each of these new adventures will likely be challenging, stimulating, and, in a few cases, close to all consuming - in ways that may cause you to lose perspective.
As you begin this next phase of your life, especially the majority of you who will eventually spend most of your waking hours in a career outside the home, I ask you to reflect on the words of Os Guinness, who astutely observed that, in todays society,
work takes up so many of our waking hours that our jobs come to define us and give us our identities. We become what we do.1
The world would often teach us that we are what we do. It does not take long in most social gatherings to realize this. One of the first questions that is asked when meeting a new person in a professional setting is "What do you do?" The answer to that question not only determines the subject and length of the ensuing conversation but also often creates the identity of the respondent from that point on.
Guinness urges us to not fall into the trap of defining ourselves by our jobs but instead to view our jobs - indeed, our entire lives - as a calling and to choose our jobs and how we fulfill them by determining who we are. In his words:
Calling reverses [the worlds] thinking. . . . Instead of, "You are what you do," calling says: "Do what you are."2
I urge you to consider this concept as you move ahead with your lives, because who you are is extraordinary - "beloved . . . son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents" with "a divine nature and destiny."3 And as a result of who you are - and who you can become - you can have a profound impact on those around you, not only in your jobs but also in your communities and, most important, in your homes.
Because you have lived in the unique environment that is Brigham Young University for the past few years, you may overlook the depth of the impact that those who become what the university and the gospel urge them to become can have on others on this campus.
In 2005, Naomi Schaeffer Riley wrote a book about religiously affiliated universities in the United States. The book is entitled God on the Quad. Riley began her book describing a speech given by author Tom Wolfe at a Class Day address at Harvard in which Wolfe described our current time frame as "the era of the fifth</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What an awesome sight to look over this blue sea of BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the worlds greatest universities. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One privilege that is mine as alumni president is to officially welcome you into our BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer upon each of you a lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 410,000 living alumni. You will have many opportunities over the years to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with this university.
The mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."1 This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesnt end, your quest doesnt end, and our relationship doesnt end. Our mission as alumni is to extend this marvelous BYU experience beyond graduation and build lifelong relationships with our alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you have learned here. We hope that you will treasure these great lessons and stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Through our alumni campaign - we call it RISE - we have begun collecting the stories of more than 6,700 of our former students. Here is just one of them.
Arizona graduate Duane Oakes initially struggled to find his place at BYU. With only a few friends and no family nearby, he was contemplating returning home when he met a student-government advisor who told him he wasnt going anywhere because she was going to mentor him. As he was helped, he discovered that he had a passion for helping other students and became involved. Through an educational career he has devoted himself to keeping the legacy going of the things he learned at BYU. He stayed involved.
Now Duane serves on the faculty of Mesa Community College and directs the Center for Community and Civic Engagement. He and his wife now lead the Arizona BYU Alumni Chapter in Phoenix. We love his story. We would love to hear your stories, and we invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
You are now entering another phase of your eternal progression. We hope your experiences at the Y have opened your eyes to future possibilities. Understand that none of us has "arrived." We are all in a process of "becoming." As you know, that process is fraught with trials and tests. But fundamental to this process is our belief in the fact that we can become what our Heavenly Father wants us to be.
Let me share a favorite story: Hope for the Flowers by Trina Paulus. This is a story of how two caterpillars traversed the trials and risks in their lives to become beautiful butterflies. It started with discovering what a butterf</span>

Unfortunately, she sprained her ankle and is propped up at home watching these proceedings on TV. She was on the faculty here for thirteen years. We love BYU. She joins me in extending our heartfelt congratulations to all graduates and their families. We are especially grateful for the excellent messages given by three of the leading lights of this dispensation: President Kevin J Worthen, Dr. Donald B. Doty, and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.
President Worthen stands tall in his position as the thirteenth president of the university. He excelled in his chosen field of law and once served as dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and as advancement vice president at BYU. In the Church he serves as an Area Seventy. We trust him. His peers look up to him. His students emulate him.
Dr. Donald B. Doty is regarded across the globe as the premiere teacher of cardiac surgery. His textbooks are used by specialists throughout the world. You will want to read every word of his amazing biographical summary in your commencement program. While excelling in his profession, he has served in the Church as bishop, stake president, regional representative, and Area Seventy. Later we called upon him to direct the medical affairs of the Missionary Department, which he did as a volunteer for nine years. We are most grateful for his and Cheryls building a network of help for our missionaries that will endure for years. We love them and salute them today, particularly Brother Doty as he gets his honorary degree. No one could be more deserving.
Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were called to the Quorum of the Twelve in April 1984. It has been my rare privilege to sit beside him in our quorum meetings for more than thirty-one years.

He also asked you to consider what God wants you to be: to be joyful, to be creative, and to develop a love of God that will bring you a fulness of joy.
Now, let me share a thought for you graduates. You are entering a new phase of life. To this point you have been striving to meet expectations imposed upon you by other people. You have passed exams and may have to pass others in order to become certified. You have been jumping over high hurdles established by others. In order to prepare for what you want to do in life, this is good. But with this transition in the pursuit of your formal education, you need to continue to focus on becoming the person the Lord needs you to be. Strive to develop the spiritual attributes of faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence.
These attributes are difficult to measure, but they constitute the substance of what the Lord hopes fo</span>
