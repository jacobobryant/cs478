  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My brothers and sisters, it is a humbling experience for me to stand before you in this capacity. To me this is a second language that I am speaking to you. I sincerely hope and pray that the Spirit of the Lord be with us tonight so that we can communicate.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tarry Ye Here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As I listened to this beautiful song, I remembered the great pain and agony, the ordeal of this holy man, the Savior Jesus Christ. After the Last Supper he led eleven apostles to the foot of the Mount of Olives, and from the eleven Jesus took three apostles, Peter, James, and John, to the midst of the grove of the Garden of Gethsemane.

As he was departing he expressed his great concern to these three apostles, saying, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me" (Matthew 26:38). And he left these three brethren. That was a time when even the Savior of the world needed the divine fellowship of his friends, Peter, James, and John. He went to the midst of the grove, fell on his knees, and prayed fervently and earnestly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39). Yes, he prayed earnestly for you and me. And when he came back, the apostles were sleeping. They didnt know what a great occasion it was, what Jesus had to go through. That was a time the divine fellowship was needed by the Savior Jesus Christ.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Exquisite You Know Not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
He went back again and he prayed, "O my father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done" (Matthew 26:42). In the Book of Mark it is recorded, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:3). It was a time of great pain, ordeal, and suffering, and Jesus himself recorded through the Prophet Joseph in Doctrine and Covenants 19:15:

&lt;i&gt;How sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent . . . ;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit - and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 19:1516, 1819]

Oh, what agony and sorrow he went through for you and me! "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (Luke 2:44). Brother James E. Talmage explained,

&lt;i&gt;It was not physical pain, nor mental anguish alone, that caused Him to suffer such torture as to produce an extrusion of blood from every pore; but a spiritual agony of soul such as only God was capable of experiencing.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Jesus the Christ, &lt;/i&gt;pp. 61314]

What pain! What suffering!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesus of Nazareth Is the Only Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Mankind cannot comprehend the pain and suffering endured for you and me. And Jesus went on the cross and died for you and me.

This is the center of our great gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth is the only "name under heaven given among men," as Peter expressed, "whereby we might be saved" (Acts 4:12). There is none other. My brothers and sisters, how much we dont know about him!

How much pain we dont know! How much suffering we dont know! How much agony we dont know! How much fear we dont know! How much trembling we dont know!

I stand before you this night and humbly bear you my witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior of the world. And I bear my witness that the same Jesus appeared to the boy Joseph and that after the resurrection he appeared on this American continent to visit the Nephites. The prophet-disciple Nephi recorded the following where Jesus himself testified that he is the Savior of the world:

&lt;i&gt;Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.&lt;/i&gt; [3 Nephi 11:14]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beautiful Savior&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I want to read from the beautiful passage that these brothers sang so well:

&lt;i&gt;Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And all the stars in heavn above;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And brings to all the world his love.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Fair are the meadows, Fairer the woodlands,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Robed in flowers of blooming spring;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He makes the sorrowing spirit sing.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Beautiful Savior! Lord of the nations!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Son of God and Son of man!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Glory and honor, praise, adoration,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Now and forevermore be thine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Now and forevermore be thine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Amen.&lt;/i&gt;
["Beautiful Savior," &lt;i&gt;Sing with Me&lt;/i&gt;, B-6]

What a beautiful, praising song we heard!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Power of Listening Ears&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
May we cultivate the power of listening ears to feel his love, and may we cultivate the power of listening ears especially for the prompting of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives so that we will come close to the Savior, so that we will know that truly he died for you and me. As someone expressed so beautifully, "Listening to the prompting of the Holy Spirit is the dimension of love." Listening is the art of the eternal quest, and I believe, my brothers and sisters, if we cultivate that power in our daily lives, we will come close to the Savior. I bear you my witness that I know Jesus is the Christ; I know it because I know he is the Savior of the world. May we cultivate that spiritual sensitivity to the prompting of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives so that we can feel and know his love constantly.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thy Will Be Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I want to express, my brothers and sisters, that I have learned that we cannot compare or comprehend with our mortal minds the suffering, the agonies, and the pain our Savior went through in the Garden of Gethsemane. However, in the walks of our daily lives, we may face our own Garden of Gethsemane.

It may be losing your eternal companion, or it may be losing your mom and dad. A friend may betray you or come to dislike you, or you may have a traffic accident. You may become deaf or handicapped. I dont know what trials we may face in our daily lives, but may we learn that beautiful lesson given to us by our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that, when we face trials and temptations, we will not blame our Lord, we will not blame God, but may we say humbly to ourselves, "Thy will be done."

May we also cultivate that faith to say to our Heavenly Father, "Thy will be done." We will not blame anybody, we will not blame our birthright, we will not blame the situations we face. May we really cultivate that power to say to our Heavenly Father, "O Lord, thy will be done."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Friend, Mick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I want to share a beautiful story about one who faced his own Garden of Gethsemane - one of your friends, Mick. He served a mission in Japan. After he returned, he earned a B.A. in political science at this great university. And he served as president of your Cougar Club. He married and had two sons.

He was active in sports and was very talented in every way when he was in school. When he had almost graduated from law school, he went to work as a clerk for a prestigious law firm in Nebraska. At their summer office garden party a tragedy occurred. The party was in a well-to-do neighborhood, and the houses bordered a man-made lake. Many people were swimming and boating on the lake. Mick decided to go for a swim and dove into what proved to be a shallow spot. He lost consciousness and someone was administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when the paramedics arrived his neck was broken, and his whole body was paralyzed. He could not move any part of his body below his neck. He required special equipment just to fill his lungs with air.

Someone asked how much he had had to drink. A friend replied, "Oh, he hadnt been drinking. Hes a Mormon."

His doctor said he did not expect him to survive such an injury. He told the family he would be lucky to make it through the first night. Now, five years later, Mick Boyle has made it through much more. He has overcome tremendous odds, has survived emotional and physical pain and suffering.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;He Never Ever Complained&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Determined to graduate, Mick resumed studying in his hospital bed in the intensive care unit at the University of Utah Medical Center only three weeks after the accident. He studied eight to ten hours each day. His fellow law school students at BYU brought tapes of lectures, notes, and textbooks to him every day. He also studied from a flip-chart, and he simply had to wait until someone came by that was nice enough to help him find the proper pages. He went through that kind of a condition.

In the spring of 1978, Mick graduated from the J. Reuben Clark Law School with members of his own class. Shortly thereafter he passed the Utah Bar Examination and became a licensed practicing attorney. He went right to work at the Legal Center for the Handicapped in Salt Lake City. In eighteen months he handled approximately 80 cases, always representing handicapped individuals in need of legal assistance.

To add to his turmoil and pain, his wife decided he was not to be her eternal companion, took the two babies, and left. That was a great shock to Mick, but he never ever complained. He said to the Lord, "Thy will be done." He insisted on serving the Lord. Then last spring the Lord answered his prayers. His former nurse came one day and knocked on his door and they became congenial friends. One day, Shirley expressed so beautifully, "I want to be your eternal companion." What a beautiful story!

Two weeks ago I asked Shirley to bear her testimony in stake conference. She gave a most beautiful testimony. There was not a dry eye in that conference. My brothers and sisters, Mick continued on. Someone asked him, "Dont you ever get depressed?"

He answered, "Oh, sure, some days I can get very depressed. However, I know there is a lot of work to be done, not only for others, but also helping myself to get well, and I must prepare to meet my Savior." Brothers and sisters, dont you think this is our goal, to prepare ourselves for the day to come?

Mick works hard at getting well. He has faith and keeps a positive attitude about his situation all the time. He exercises every day and maintains contact with the doctors. He has recently made a most astonishing improvement and breakthrough.

My brothers and sisters, how much we can learn from this kind of story! Time has always been important to Mick. Since his accident he has wasted no time, and he has accomplished more than ever. Brothers and sisters, are you blind, are you deaf, are you paralyzed, are you unloved by someone, or are you diseased spiritually or emotionally or physically? May we learn the great principle - to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ because he died for you and me, and he is our Master, he is our God, and he is the Anchor of our souls. May we cultivate the power of his great love so that we can be close to him, to say to the Lord, "Lord, I humbly express myself. May I serve thee and glorify thy name forevermore."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Young Boy Lost His Father&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My brothers and sisters, I want to tell you another story that happened in Japan right after the war. A young boy lost a father and lost practically everything in his life because of the war. This young boy naturally hated Americans, was prejudiced against them because of his lack of understanding. As he grew up, this young boy learned that a handful of Japanese leaders took the initiative to start the war, and he understood the true situation.

Things were difficult - not enough food or clothing for him or his family. His mother always tried to help, to teach, and to clothe the family. After he graduated from junior high school, this young boy had a chance to go to senior high school. One day he heard a conversation between his mother and brother and found out the financial difficulties of his home. The next morning, though his brother said that he could go to senior high school, this young man decided, "My brother, I will not go; I will work and help the family."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save My Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
He found a job in a tiny shop which produced a bean curd (we call it tofu in Japan) and attended school part-time at night. He would get up in the morning at 4:30, work until 6:00 p.m., go to school until 11:00 p.m., and not get home until 11:30 p.m. He followed this demanding schedule for about one year, but it became too much and he found himself in the hospital one day suffering from exhaustion. His condition was very critical, and he sensed that. Without knowing of Jesus Christ or God or even how to pray, he prayed, "O God, if thou art there, save my life. If thou wilt save me, I shall repay thee someday. I will serve thee."

This was the simple prayer of this young boy. He was able to leave the hospital after two months. In order to recuperate he stayed with an uncle in the northern part of Japan.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Few More Doors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
At about the same time there were two young men, one from Pocatello, Idaho, and one from Salt Lake City, who went to San Francisco and crossed the big pond, the Pacific. It took them almost a month. There were no jumbo planes in those days. After a few months of training and laboring in Tokyo, they went to the northern part of Japan to a very cold place, not a dry cold like here, but high humidity - it was very wet there.

It was a P-day, but the senior companion from Idaho, Elder Delmont C. Law, a great man, asked his companion, R. Gordon Porter, if they could go knock on doors. They had had no success whatsoever for days, weeks, and months. Then finally, on this P-day, they decided to keep trying, and after breakfast they took off. They knocked, knocked, and knocked on doors that day. When evening came, bringing with it more cold and rain, they decided they should go home. Then the Spirit prompted them again, especially the senior companion from Pocatello, Idaho, who said to his companion, "Companion, can we do a few more doors?" They again agreed and then went on.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Stitches from the War Were Gone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In that same vicinity lived the young man who had just left the hospital and was recuperating in his uncles home. He was waiting for something without knowing what. In a dark and cold room in that uncles home, the missionaries found this young man. When he saw these foreigners, he said to them, "I dont like you Americans. Please go home."

That was the first reply of the young boy, but the missionary from Pocatello, Idaho, replied, "We have a message for you. Cant you even spend five minutes?" That was a very strong statement, and the young boy couldnt refuse them and welcomed them inside. These missionaries taught him the most beautiful story, and this young boy accepted the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that day. He was baptized two weeks later and grew in the gospel. My brothers and sisters, that young boy is now standing before you.

On that day I almost missed the glorious everlasting gospel that your forefathers and mothers preserved, this great legacy, great heritage, glorious truth, even the teachings of Jesus Christ. I accepted the beauties of that day. I glanced at the beauties of the panorama of this great gospel of love and this legacy. To me, my wounds, my pain, my suffering, my patches, and my stitches from the war were gone because of the gospel of the Lord, our Savior, even Jesus Christ.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Too May Touch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I stand before you and bear you my witness that this is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know that Joseph saw God the Father and Jesus Christ and this is a glorious gospel. I pray and I seek that the glorious blessings, the choicest blessings, the bounteous blessings, of our Heavenly Father will be with you. May we see, comprehend, envision, and understand your legacy in this great gospel that you have that you, too, may touch the lives of other people.

I leave you my witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I love this Church. I love you beautiful people. I love my Heavenly Father. I love the Lord Jesus Christ. Without him we are meaningless. In him and by him and through him and by the grace of his pure love, once again may we return to our Heavenly Fathers presence.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serve Our Master&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I know that you have that burning desire in your hearts and that beautiful sparkle of divinity within your bosom, that legacy you inherited from your forefathers and mothers to bless the lives of many others. May your light so shine to the world after you graduate from this great institution; may you be the light to the world, the salt of the earth - and surely you must be the savor of the salt.

I know that is our beautiful destiny, to glorify the Lords name and to testify of his holy mission. Im grateful to have the opportunity to stand before you here. (I prepared my talk in a script, but I decided not to use it tonight.) I pray tonight that you may feel the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of our Heavenly Father, and of the Holy Ghost, so that you may go and be determined to serve our Master in the most beautiful way.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;I Love You with All My Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I thank my wife. She is my companion and she is my friend. She is my girlfriend. She is my eternal mate, my eternal counselor and friend. Please, you young husbands, sometimes go out without the children and buy a Big Mac! Take time to be thoughtful. Take time to be kind, and take time to go to the temple together. Take time to hold hands and to pray. And take time to climb the mountain - after the snow melts, of course - and to sit upon the rock and say to your eternal mate, "I love you with all my heart." And go to Utah Lake, but be careful this year; we have lots of water there. Walk the shore of that beautiful lake and say again, "I love you." Those of you still looking for your eternal mate, dont rush, but hurry. The Spirit will guide you, and you will find a beautiful companion.

I leave you my solemn witness and testimony that this is the work of the Lord, and Jesus is the Christ. Joseph was a prophet and Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of the Lord. He said one time, "With all the love I have and possess, I love the Saints and I bless the Saints." May we listen to his great counsel, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My brothers and sisters, it is a humbling experience for me to stand before you in this capacity. To me this is a second language that I am speaking to you. I sincerely hope and pray that the Spirit of the Lord be with us tonight so that we can communicate.</p>
<h2><b>Tarry Ye Here</b></h2>
<p>As I listened to this beautiful song, I remembered the great pain and agony, the ordeal of this holy man, the Savior Jesus Christ. After the Last Supper he led eleven apostles to the foot of the Mount of Olives, and from the eleven Jesus took three apostles, Peter, James, and John, to the midst of the grove of the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p>As he was departing he expressed his great concern to these three apostles, saying, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me" (Matthew 26:38). And he left these three brethren. That was a time when even the Savior of the world needed the divine fellowship of his friends, Peter, James, and John. He went to the midst of the grove, fell on his knees, and prayed fervently and earnestly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39). Yes, he prayed earnestly for you and me. And when he came back, the apostles were sleeping. They didnt know what a great occasion it was, what Jesus had to go through. That was a time the divine fellowship was needed by the Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2><b>How Exquisite You Know Not</b></h2>
<p>He went back again and he prayed, "O my father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done" (Matthew 26:42). In the Book of Mark it is recorded, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:3). It was a time of great pain, ordeal, and suffering, and Jesus himself recorded through the Prophet Joseph in Doctrine and Covenants 19:15:</p>
<p><i>How sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i></p>
<p><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent . . . ;</i></p>
<p><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit - and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink - </i></p>
<p><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. </i>[D&amp;C 19:1516, 1819]</p>
<p>Oh, what agony and sorrow he went through for you and me! "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (Luke 2:44). Brother James E. Talmage explained,</p>
<p><i>It was not physical pain, nor mental anguish alone, that caused Him to suffer such torture as to produce an extrusion of blood from every pore; but a spiritual agony of soul such as only God was capable of experiencing.</i> [<i>Jesus the Christ, </i>pp. 61314]</p>
<p>What pain! What suffering!</p>
<h2><b>Jesus of Nazareth Is the Only Name</b></h2>
<p>Mankind cannot comprehend the pain and suffering endured for you and me. And Jesus went on the cross and died for you and me.</p>
<p>This is the center of our great gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth is the only "name under heaven given among men," as Peter expressed, "whereby we might be saved" (Acts 4:12). There is none other. My brothers and sisters, how much we dont know about him!</p>
<p>How much pain we dont know! How much suffering we dont know! How much agony we dont know! How much fear we dont know! How much trembling we dont know!</p>
<p>I stand before you this night and humbly bear you my witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior of the world. And I bear my witness that the same Jesus appeared to the boy Joseph and that after the resurrection he appeared on this American continent to visit the Nephites. The prophet-disciple Nephi recorded the following where Jesus himself testified that he is the Savior of the world:</p>
<p><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i> [3 Nephi 11:14]</p>
<h2><b>Beautiful Savior</b></h2>
<p>I want to read from the beautiful passage that these brothers sang so well:</p>
<p><i>Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight</i><br />
<i>And all the stars in heavn above;</i><br />
<i>Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer</i><br />
<i>And brings to all the world his love.</i></p>
<p><i>Fair are the meadows, Fairer the woodlands,</i><br />
<i>Robed in flowers of blooming spring;</i><br />
<i>Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,</i><br />
<i>He makes the sorrowing spirit sing.</i></p>
<p><i>Beautiful Savior! Lord of the nations!</i><br />
<i>Son of God and Son of man!</i><br />
<i>Glory and honor, praise, adoration,</i><br />
<i>Now and forevermore be thine.</i><br />
<i>Now and forevermore be thine</i><br />
<i>Amen.</i><br />
["Beautiful Savior," <i>Sing with Me</i>, B-6]</p>
<p>What a beautiful, praising song we heard!</p>
<h2><b>The Power of Listening Ears</b></h2>
<p>May we cultivate the power of listening ears to feel his love, and may we cultivate the power of listening ears especially for the prompting of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives so that we will come close to the Savior, so that we will know that truly he died for you and me. As someone expressed so beautifully, "Listening to the prompting of the Holy Spirit is the dimension of love." Listening is the art of the eternal quest, and I believe, my brothers and sisters, if we cultivate that power in our daily lives, we will come close to the Savior. I bear you my witness that I know Jesus is the Christ; I know it because I know he is the Savior of the world. May we cultivate that spiritual sensitivity to the prompting of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives so that we can feel and know his love constantly.</p>
<h2><b>Thy Will Be Done</b></h2>
<p>I want to express, my brothers and sisters, that I have learned that we cannot compare or comprehend with our mortal minds the suffering, the agonies, and the pain our Savior went through in the Garden of Gethsemane. However, in the walks of our daily lives, we may face our own Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p>It may be losing your eternal companion, or it may be losing your mom and dad. A friend may betray you or come to dislike you, or you may have a traffic accident. You may become deaf or handicapped. I dont know what trials we may face in our daily lives, but may we learn that beautiful lesson given to us by our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that, when we face trials and temptations, we will not blame our Lord, we will not blame God, but may we say humbly to ourselves, "Thy will be done."</p>
<p>May we also cultivate that faith to say to our Heavenly Father, "Thy will be done." We will not blame anybody, we will not blame our birthright, we will not blame the situations we face. May we really cultivate that power to say to our Heavenly Father, "O Lord, thy will be done."</p>
<h2><b>Your Friend, Mick</b></h2>
<p>I want to share a beautiful story about one who faced his own Garden of Gethsemane - one of your friends, Mick. He served a mission in Japan. After he returned, he earned a B.A. in political science at this great university. And he served as president of your Cougar Club. He married and had two sons.</p>
<p>He was active in sports and was very talented in every way when he was in school. When he had almost graduated from law school, he went to work as a clerk for a prestigious law firm in Nebraska. At their summer office garden party a tragedy occurred. The party was in a well-to-do neighborhood, and the houses bordered a man-made lake. Many people were swimming and boating on the lake. Mick decided to go for a swim and dove into what proved to be a shallow spot. He lost consciousness and someone was administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when the paramedics arrived his neck was broken, and his whole body was paralyzed. He could not move any part of his body below his neck. He required special equipment just to fill his lungs with air.</p>
<p>Someone asked how much he had had to drink. A friend replied, "Oh, he hadnt been drinking. Hes a Mormon."</p>
<p>His doctor said he did not expect him to survive such an injury. He told the family he would be lucky to make it through the first night. Now, five years later, Mick Boyle has made it through much more. He has overcome tremendous odds, has survived emotional and physical pain and suffering.</p>
<h2><b>He Never Ever Complained</b></h2>
<p>Determined to graduate, Mick resumed studying in his hospital bed in the intensive care unit at the University of Utah Medical Center only three weeks after the accident. He studied eight to ten hours each day. His fellow law school students at BYU brought tapes of lectures, notes, and textbooks to him every day. He also studied from a flip-chart, and he simply had to wait until someone came by that was nice enough to help him find the proper pages. He went through that kind of a condition.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1978, Mick graduated from the J. Reuben Clark Law School with members of his own class. Shortly thereafter he passed the Utah Bar Examination and became a licensed practicing attorney. He went right to work at the Legal Center for the Handicapped in Salt Lake City. In eighteen months he handled approximately 80 cases, always representing handicapped individuals in need of legal assistance.</p>
<p>To add to his turmoil and pain, his wife decided he was not to be her eternal companion, took the two babies, and left. That was a great shock to Mick, but he never ever complained. He said to the Lord, "Thy will be done." He insisted on serving the Lord. Then last spring the Lord answered his prayers. His former nurse came one day and knocked on his door and they became congenial friends. One day, Shirley expressed so beautifully, "I want to be your eternal companion." What a beautiful story!</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I asked Shirley to bear her testimony in stake conference. She gave a most beautiful testimony. There was not a dry eye in that conference. My brothers and sisters, Mick continued on. Someone asked him, "Dont you ever get depressed?"</p>
<p>He answered, "Oh, sure, some days I can get very depressed. However, I know there is a lot of work to be done, not only for others, but also helping myself to get well, and I must prepare to meet my Savior." Brothers and sisters, dont you think this is our goal, to prepare ourselves for the day to come?</p>
<p>Mick works hard at getting well. He has faith and keeps a positive attitude about his situation all the time. He exercises every day and maintains contact with the doctors. He has recently made a most astonishing improvement and breakthrough.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, how much we can learn from this kind of story! Time has always been important to Mick. Since his accident he has wasted no time, and he has accomplished more than ever. Brothers and sisters, are you blind, are you deaf, are you paralyzed, are you unloved by someone, or are you diseased spiritually or emotionally or physically? May we learn the great principle - to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ because he died for you and me, and he is our Master, he is our God, and he is the Anchor of our souls. May we cultivate the power of his great love so that we can be close to him, to say to the Lord, "Lord, I humbly express myself. May I serve thee and glorify thy name forevermore."</p>
<h2><b>A Young Boy Lost His Father</b></h2>
<p>My brothers and sisters, I want to tell you another story that happened in Japan right after the war. A young boy lost a father and lost practically everything in his life because of the war. This young boy naturally hated Americans, was prejudiced against them because of his lack of understanding. As he grew up, this young boy learned that a handful of Japanese leaders took the initiative to start the war, and he understood the true situation.</p>
<p>Things were difficult - not enough food or clothing for him or his family. His mother always tried to help, to teach, and to clothe the family. After he graduated from junior high school, this young boy had a chance to go to senior high school. One day he heard a conversation between his mother and brother and found out the financial difficulties of his home. The next morning, though his brother said that he could go to senior high school, this young man decided, "My brother, I will not go; I will work and help the family."</p>
<h2><b>Save My Life</b></h2>
<p>He found a job in a tiny shop which produced a bean curd (we call it tofu in Japan) and attended school part-time at night. He would get up in the morning at 4:30, work until 6:00 p.m., go to school until 11:00 p.m., and not get home until 11:30 p.m. He followed this demanding schedule for about one year, but it became too much and he found himself in the hospital one day suffering from exhaustion. His condition was very critical, and he sensed that. Without knowing of Jesus Christ or God or even how to pray, he prayed, "O God, if thou art there, save my life. If thou wilt save me, I shall repay thee someday. I will serve thee."</p>
<p>This was the simple prayer of this young boy. He was able to leave the hospital after two months. In order to recuperate he stayed with an uncle in the northern part of Japan.</p>
<h2><b>A Few More Doors</b></h2>
<p>At about the same time there were two young men, one from Pocatello, Idaho, and one from Salt Lake City, who went to San Francisco and crossed the big pond, the Pacific. It took them almost a month. There were no jumbo planes in those days. After a few months of training and laboring in Tokyo, they went to the northern part of Japan to a very cold place, not a dry cold like here, but high humidity - it was very wet there.</p>
<p>It was a P-day, but the senior companion from Idaho, Elder Delmont C. Law, a great man, asked his companion, R. Gordon Porter, if they could go knock on doors. They had had no success whatsoever for days, weeks, and months. Then finally, on this P-day, they decided to keep trying, and after breakfast they took off. They knocked, knocked, and knocked on doors that day. When evening came, bringing with it more cold and rain, they decided they should go home. Then the Spirit prompted them again, especially the senior companion from Pocatello, Idaho, who said to his companion, "Companion, can we do a few more doors?" They again agreed and then went on.</p>
<h2><b>My Stitches from the War Were Gone</b></h2>
<p>In that same vicinity lived the young man who had just left the hospital and was recuperating in his uncles home. He was waiting for something without knowing what. In a dark and cold room in that uncles home, the missionaries found this young man. When he saw these foreigners, he said to them, "I dont like you Americans. Please go home."</p>
<p>That was the first reply of the young boy, but the missionary from Pocatello, Idaho, replied, "We have a message for you. Cant you even spend five minutes?" That was a very strong statement, and the young boy couldnt refuse them and welcomed them inside. These missionaries taught him the most beautiful story, and this young boy accepted the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that day. He was baptized two weeks later and grew in the gospel. My brothers and sisters, that young boy is now standing before you.</p>
<p>On that day I almost missed the glorious everlasting gospel that your forefathers and mothers preserved, this great legacy, great heritage, glorious truth, even the teachings of Jesus Christ. I accepted the beauties of that day. I glanced at the beauties of the panorama of this great gospel of love and this legacy. To me, my wounds, my pain, my suffering, my patches, and my stitches from the war were gone because of the gospel of the Lord, our Savior, even Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2><b>You Too May Touch</b></h2>
<p>I stand before you and bear you my witness that this is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know that Joseph saw God the Father and Jesus Christ and this is a glorious gospel. I pray and I seek that the glorious blessings, the choicest blessings, the bounteous blessings, of our Heavenly Father will be with you. May we see, comprehend, envision, and understand your legacy in this great gospel that you have that you, too, may touch the lives of other people.</p>
<p>I leave you my witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I love this Church. I love you beautiful people. I love my Heavenly Father. I love the Lord Jesus Christ. Without him we are meaningless. In him and by him and through him and by the grace of his pure love, once again may we return to our Heavenly Fathers presence.</p>
<h2><b>Serve Our Master</b></h2>
<p>I know that you have that burning desire in your hearts and that beautiful sparkle of divinity within your bosom, that legacy you inherited from your forefathers and mothers to bless the lives of many others. May your light so shine to the world after you graduate from this great institution; may you be the light to the world, the salt of the earth - and surely you must be the savor of the salt.</p>
<p>I know that is our beautiful destiny, to glorify the Lords name and to testify of his holy mission. Im grateful to have the opportunity to stand before you here. (I prepared my talk in a script, but I decided not to use it tonight.) I pray tonight that you may feel the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of our Heavenly Father, and of the Holy Ghost, so that you may go and be determined to serve our Master in the most beautiful way.</p>
<h2><b>I Love You with All My Heart</b></h2>
<p>I thank my wife. She is my companion and she is my friend. She is my girlfriend. She is my eternal mate, my eternal counselor and friend. Please, you young husbands, sometimes go out without the children and buy a Big Mac! Take time to be thoughtful. Take time to be kind, and take time to go to the temple together. Take time to hold hands and to pray. And take time to climb the mountain - after the snow melts, of course - and to sit upon the rock and say to your eternal mate, "I love you with all my heart." And go to Utah Lake, but be careful this year; we have lots of water there. Walk the shore of that beautiful lake and say again, "I love you." Those of you still looking for your eternal mate, dont rush, but hurry. The Spirit will guide you, and you will find a beautiful companion.</p>
<p>I leave you my solemn witness and testimony that this is the work of the Lord, and Jesus is the Christ. Joseph was a prophet and Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of the Lord. He said one time, "With all the love I have and possess, I love the Saints and I bless the Saints." May we listen to his great counsel, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am humbled to stand where prophets, apostles, General Authorities, university presidents, important scholars, and world leaders have stood. As a student at BYU thirty years ago, I attended the devotionals and forums quite faithfully. I loved taking a break once a week to listen to remarkable individuals share their insights on a myriad of topics. I enjoyed listening and learning without any worry that I might be tested on what I was hearing. It was education at its best.
I am what I used to refer to as the dark horse in the devotional lineup. A dark horse is a completely unknown quantity with no name recognition whatsoever. You are probably like one of my students who looked at the list of speakers for the semester and asked, "Why are you on the list?"
My response to her was, "I dont know! Ive been asking myself the same question!" But whatever the reason, I am here, and I hope that something I share this morning will move you to open your hearts to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost and that you will be encouraged in your efforts to follow our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The Invitation
One of my favorite scriptures is found in Matthew 11. It is Christs universal invitation that speaks to each of us personally:
 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. [Matthew 11:2830]
I love this passage because in a few short verses Christ lays before us the path to eternal life. The overtones and undertones of these verses resonate with truth. First, the very fact that this is an invitation to "come," to "take," and to "learn" indicates an acknowledgment of and a respect for our agency. This respect for agency causes me to think of our premortal life, when we fought in our Fathers army to preserve and maintain the condition of agency in this life. It seems right that Christ, who is the linchpin in our Fathers plan of happiness, would acknowledge that it is our choice to come unto Him or not.
I also appreciate the simple promise of rest that is given. Having labored under sin and its heavy weight of guilt and separation from God, I am grateful for the rest and reconciliation Christ promises to those who come unto Him.
I find great meaning in the word yoke. It evokes so many important things about Christs path. A yoke is a wooden bar or frame by which two draft animals are joined at the neck for the purpose of working together to pull a heavy load. A yoke is also a frame fitted to a persons shoulders to carry a load in two equal portions. Whether we envision a double or a single yoke, the Savior is part of this image. We are either teamed with Him, side by side, or we are carrying His yoke. Yokes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Welcome to fall semester. We hope you have all been able to settle into your new schedules. Fall semester can be a time of fresh starts. It can be a time of great expectations. It can also be a time when things are practically perfect. For example, it is probably safe to say that right now most of you have perfect grades in all of your classes! It can be a time when hopes run high and your roommate situation is quite fabulous. It is a time when all of our athletic teams are on course for tremendous seasons - yes, even perhaps national championships! And it is a time when you are able to meet new people, even perhaps that special someone.
The beginning of fall semester can indeed be an exciting time. You are most likely focused on a course of study and ready for what this new semester has to offer. We are excited for you! We hope that all of your expectations are met and that your experience here is a wonderfully memorable one. We also hope that as you are here at Brigham Young University and after you leave to pursue your own course in life, you will always take great care to do those things that will keep you out of harms way, both temporally and spiritually; that you will have proper focus and perspective; and that you will heed the counsel of Nephis brother Jacob, who said to his family, "O be wise; what can I say more?" (Jacob 6:12).
Sometimes as we embark and proceed on a new journey we find that our expectations are not met. What we had anticipated and hoped for in the beginning of our journey has not come to pass. Our ideals are not our realities. Maybe we are not getting the grades we had hoped for or we havent met that special someone. Perhaps we didnt get the job we thought we deserved. We may find that things are just not working out as we had planned. The question then becomes, What will be our reaction to our unanticipated situation? What will we do? This is where I believe Jacobs counsel to "be wise" deserves serious attention.
At times, in these situations, the easiest thing to do is to place the responsibility for our situation on something or someone else. This is a dangerous course to take. It is harmful. It is extremely unwise. We see this in the Book of Mormon when people blamed their behavior on the traditions of their fathers. Not accepting responsibility for the direction of our own lives can distort our perceptions and can cause us to lose focus of the things that are important. It can cause us to become disoriented and can keep us from progressing. It is a waste of valuable time in these days of our earthly probation.
Another easy but unwise thing we might do during unforeseen situations is obsess about things we cant control. Recently I read about "a thrill-seeking photographer" who was described as a person who "often diced with death in the water."1 He would repeatedly put himself into very dangerous situations in order to capture footage of </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am humbled and thankful to be among so many friends today and to see so many of my current and former students. Thank you for this opportunity, President Worthen.
I grew up on a large cattle ranch, first near Eureka, Nevada, and later in Kanosh, Utah. I would start the days very early by catching and saddling my horse in the moonlit and frosty morning hours. As the first rays of sunshine would start coming over the mountains, the cowboys I was working with would scatter out and begin looking for cows and calves from among sagebrush flats and juniper-covered hillsides. The sight was surreal as I would watch hundreds of cows and calves being herded toward a corral to be branded and vaccinated.
As a young boy I aspired to be able to rope the calves as my part of the branding. Alternative responsibilities entailed wrestling the calves to the ground, oftentimes resulting in me getting kicked or run over. At about the age of seven, after repeated failures in tackling the calves, I was finally allowed to try my hand at roping. I remember proudly getting my lasso rope ready and searching out the smallest and slowest-looking calf in the herd. I carefully planned my throw, and I felt the thrill of accomplishment when the loop settled over the calf successfully. Though the calf was seemingly small and slow, I felt its tremendous force start to jerk me off my horse. Despite trying my best to hold onto the calf, I found that my strength was no match for him. Just as I was being violently jerked out of my saddle, I heard a wise cowboy yell across to me: "Dally up!"
To dally means to take the rope and making two or three quick wraps around the saddle horn. The saddle becomes an anchor point, which connects to the greater strength of a steady and powerful horse. The dally transformed my situation of having inadequate personal strength to being able to access a greater power that anchored the turbulent polar forces acting upon me. This simple act allowed me to draw strength from something far greater than myself. Instead of being violently yanked from my saddle, I found the relative ease of letting my horse do the pulling while I had the much more simple and manageable task of holding the dally tight and maintaining the connection to the anchoring force.
Many times in my life since then I have felt the strength of greater powers than I have been prepared to withstand. These have seemed to yank me from a place of security and comfort. Each time, I have reflected upon opportunities to dally up to a power greater than my own that can serve as an anchor of strength. I would like to share some of the points of my learning about how to dally up in our inevitable circumstances and the need to find our anchor during turbulent times in our lives:
1. Strength in service
2. Strength in involvement
3. Strength in commitments
Strength in Service

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an adjunct professor who has taught at BYU for several years, I am in awe of this amazing institution that attracts the finest, most extraordinary faculty and stu-dents on the planet.
I honor you and believe that King Benjamin could have easily been describing you when he said:
And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual. [Mosiah 2:41]
Yes, you are awesome, and this could be the most important assignment I have ever had as a professional speaker. Consequently, I wanted to be at my best.
However, as I was getting ready this morning, I noticed that I was losing hair on my head and growing it in my nose and ears and on my back - in places I dont even need it. That is not a fair trade-off. My only hope this morning was that the hair in my right ear would grow long enough so that I could comb it up over the top of my head and fake all of you out! It didnt happen.
When President Worthen asked me to speak to you today, two life-altering experiences surfaced in my mind, helping me focus my remarks. First, I recently returned from an eighteen-day military tribute tour with my invited guests American Idol finalist/Sony recording artist David Archuleta; world-class musician, vocal coach, and musical director Dean Kaelin; and celebrity impressionist Jason Hewlett. We performed our Evening of Music, Comedy, and Motivational Theater to fourteen amazing audiences; held six firesides for the U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Kuwait along the Iraqi border; and concluded the tour with a special visit to the missionaries, members, and investigators in Ethiopia. We were touched by the dedication of Church members and the fearless commitment to service before self of our brave men and women in uniform. And when we got shot at and returned machine gun fire during one of our flights in a Chinook helicopter to a remote forward operating base, I realized that we should never take our freedom for granted and was reminded of the sense of urgency with which we all should live our lives.
The second life-altering experience happened on October 23, 2010, when I had the rare opportunity to soar to the edge of space in a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Because it was a classified mission, I can only tell you that at 70,000 feet you can see two-thirds of the state of California. At 80,000 feet you can see some distinctly mapped outlines of America. And at 90,000 feet you tear up and feel like you can reach out and touch the face of God! It was a spiritual experience I wish each of you could have.
For four hours I sat in the sounds of silence, looking at the breathtaking curvature of the earth, gazing into the endless blackness of space, pondering eternity, and reflecting on President Dieter F. Uchtdorfs reminder that we are more </span>
