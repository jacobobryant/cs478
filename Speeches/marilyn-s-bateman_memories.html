  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is January 1996. It is the beginning of a new year and a new semester at BYU. The old year, 1995, will not be forgotten, but it is never to be relived again except in our memories. Events of the past year came and went. They were special, they were hard, they were sad, they were joyous.

In retrospect, the past year has flown by. All we have left of it are the memories. The events and the memories of our lives are a composite of who we are - of what makes us tick. But it is interesting when you think about it - our memories can play tricks on us. Consequently, it behooves us to be positive in our approach to life; otherwise our store of memories will have a negative balance rather than a positive balance of happy memories. &lt;i&gt;Good&lt;/i&gt; memories become sanctified in our minds!

Elder Neal A. Maxwell made the statement in a mission presidents seminar in Japan during my husbands assignment in the Asia North Area Presidency that the "ultimate emancipation" will be "one day to live in the presence of God with the past, present, and future, which have become an eternal now." When that day comes, we will see things as they really are. We wont see through a glass darkly. My guess is that we will be overcome with joy and gratitude for our beautiful lives. We will be grateful for the challenges that we have had and will have in our "past, present, and future" existence. We will praise God for his goodness to us.

Make happy memories. Make each day a happy one. Goethe said, "Happiness is a choice." Choose to make this year and this semester a happy experience - a happy memory.

The beginning of a new year is traditionally when we make our resolves for the months ahead. Many of you have already made a list of New Years resolutions. May I suggest that all of you consider two resolutions from my list. These are not the usual ones like losing five pounds (or gaining five depending on your circumstance), reading the scriptures every day, and staying on top of your homework, etc. Although these things are important and may be on your lists, I would like to make two suggestions that are not quite so ordinary.

Here is the first resolution: I encourage you to keep a record of the little miracles that happen in your lives. These things are often so seemingly insignificant that we may not see them for what they are. We must call upon the Spirit to help us recognize the touch of the Masters hand in our lives. As you come to recognize and record these little miracles, they will become fixed in your mind and you will be surprised how very blessed you are and how aware God is of you.

The second resolution is that you look for an opportunity to render a kind act of service each day, and do it consciously. There are many things possible that you might do. Most wont take a lot of time. To offer some suggestions, I would like to mention a few points from President Howard W. Hunters 1994 Christmas message. He suggests we might mend a quarrel; dismiss suspicion and replace it with trust; write a letter (please write to your parents); encourage a friend; forego a grudge; apologize; express your gratitude; see the beauty of the earth; speak your love and speak it again. (See "The Gifts of Christmas," First Presidency Christmas Devotional, 4 December 1994.)

As we look outside ourselves in offering service and extending love to others, our own lives become fuller and richer. Life seems to fall into place better. We are choosing the good life, the happy life.

President Bateman and I are so pleased to be here at BYU. This is our school of choice - our familys school of choice. It always has been - we are true-blue. BYU is a very special place; you make it that way. We feel of your vitality and your strength. We admire you for your preparation and your choice to come here to get your education and to strengthen your spiritual roots. We resolve to do all we can to help you realize your potential. As the Savior called his disciples "friends," we are your friends.

Jesus Christ is our Savior. He extends his grace and all that he has to us. He bids us accept his offering. I am thankful to him. I am thankful for the special witness that can come to us through the Holy Ghost of the reality of Gods purposes. May you be blessed in your honest efforts to know his will for you. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

&lt;i&gt;Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 9 January 1996.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>It is January 1996. It is the beginning of a new year and a new semester at BYU. The old year, 1995, will not be forgotten, but it is never to be relived again except in our memories. Events of the past year came and went. They were special, they were hard, they were sad, they were joyous.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the past year has flown by. All we have left of it are the memories. The events and the memories of our lives are a composite of who we are - of what makes us tick. But it is interesting when you think about it - our memories can play tricks on us. Consequently, it behooves us to be positive in our approach to life; otherwise our store of memories will have a negative balance rather than a positive balance of happy memories. <i>Good</i> memories become sanctified in our minds!</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell made the statement in a mission presidents seminar in Japan during my husbands assignment in the Asia North Area Presidency that the "ultimate emancipation" will be "one day to live in the presence of God with the past, present, and future, which have become an eternal now." When that day comes, we will see things as they really are. We wont see through a glass darkly. My guess is that we will be overcome with joy and gratitude for our beautiful lives. We will be grateful for the challenges that we have had and will have in our "past, present, and future" existence. We will praise God for his goodness to us.</p>
<p>Make happy memories. Make each day a happy one. Goethe said, "Happiness is a choice." Choose to make this year and this semester a happy experience - a happy memory.</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year is traditionally when we make our resolves for the months ahead. Many of you have already made a list of New Years resolutions. May I suggest that all of you consider two resolutions from my list. These are not the usual ones like losing five pounds (or gaining five depending on your circumstance), reading the scriptures every day, and staying on top of your homework, etc. Although these things are important and may be on your lists, I would like to make two suggestions that are not quite so ordinary.</p>
<p>Here is the first resolution: I encourage you to keep a record of the little miracles that happen in your lives. These things are often so seemingly insignificant that we may not see them for what they are. We must call upon the Spirit to help us recognize the touch of the Masters hand in our lives. As you come to recognize and record these little miracles, they will become fixed in your mind and you will be surprised how very blessed you are and how aware God is of you.</p>
<p>The second resolution is that you look for an opportunity to render a kind act of service each day, and do it consciously. There are many things possible that you might do. Most wont take a lot of time. To offer some suggestions, I would like to mention a few points from President Howard W. Hunters 1994 Christmas message. He suggests we might mend a quarrel; dismiss suspicion and replace it with trust; write a letter (please write to your parents); encourage a friend; forego a grudge; apologize; express your gratitude; see the beauty of the earth; speak your love and speak it again. (See "The Gifts of Christmas," First Presidency Christmas Devotional, 4 December 1994.)</p>
<p>As we look outside ourselves in offering service and extending love to others, our own lives become fuller and richer. Life seems to fall into place better. We are choosing the good life, the happy life.</p>
<p>President Bateman and I are so pleased to be here at BYU. This is our school of choice - our familys school of choice. It always has been - we are true-blue. BYU is a very special place; you make it that way. We feel of your vitality and your strength. We admire you for your preparation and your choice to come here to get your education and to strengthen your spiritual roots. We resolve to do all we can to help you realize your potential. As the Savior called his disciples "friends," we are your friends.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is our Savior. He extends his grace and all that he has to us. He bids us accept his offering. I am thankful to him. I am thankful for the special witness that can come to us through the Holy Ghost of the reality of Gods purposes. May you be blessed in your honest efforts to know his will for you. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Welcome to fall semester 2017. I hope you have a wonderful experience this year at BYU. I remember my first semester here as a student. I was thrilled at the thought that I was finally going to further my education, but, at the same time, I have to admit I was somewhat anxious. The prospect of being a student at BYU was daunting. I was a nontraditional student returning to school when our youngest child was in kindergarten. I remember looking at the syllabus of each class and wondering if I could do everything that was required.
I had chosen English as a major and was looking forward to attending all of the classes. I hoped I could keep up. I say I was looking forward to attending all of the classes, and that is mostly true, but there was one exception: intermediate algebra.
Algebra and I have a dubious history. Algebra was a required course in junior high and in high school, and I learned quickly that algebra was not one of my strong points. I did manage, however, to pass those precollege algebra classes - mainly by doing extra-credit assignments given to me by sympathetic algebra teachers. So, knowing what I knew about my history with algebra and knowing that I would have to take the intermediate algebra class in order to graduate from BYU, I did the only thing I could think of: I procrastinated.
The problem with procrastination is that whatever you choose to procrastinate never seems to go away. Instead it looms large. The time finally came when I could procrastinate no longer. It was the last semester of my senior year - the proverbial eleventh hour. I finally registered for the algebra class, attended the first day of class, and immediately knew I was in over my head.
My friend Mary, who is a mathematical whiz, could sense my panic. She suggested that I drop the class and register for the independent study algebra course. She said she would tutor me. I was so grateful to her.
That was the beginning of what my family calls "the year that Mom took algebra." It consumed a lot of my time. Passing my algebra class became a family project. Not only did I have the help of my friend Mary, who tutored me, but I also had Kevins help and the help of my two sons. They spent hours helping me with my homework. They truly endured this experience with me.
When I wasnt working on my homework, it seemed like I was expressing my discontent to anyone who would listen. In other words, I complained a lot. I remember complaining to my mother about the fact that I was an English major and that I didnt understand why I even had to take algebra.
In a very reassuring, motherly way, she said, "Peggy, you never know when you are going to need algebra."
I am sure she thought it was good counsel, but I was forty-three years old and had somehow managed to get by without algebra up to that point in my</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">March 20 of this year was a beautiful day. It was warm and the sun was shining. Some of the trees had started to bud, and early blooms were visible. I had been anticipating this day with great excitement and a good deal of apprehension from the time I received a phone call three months earlier asking if I would play the organ at one of the Provo City Center Temple dedication sessions. I had never dreamed I would have a chance to serve in this capacity, for I knew there were scores of talented and accomplished organists in our temple district, and I was also keenly aware of my own inadequacies.
Surprise and shock were some of the feelings I had when I got the call, but in the few seconds it took me to stammer out an acceptance of this assignment, I felt my Heavenly Fathers love. And even though I was very nervous, I sensed that this was one of His tender mercies.
I was to have an experience similar to one that my beautiful paternal grandmother, Ethel Taylor Robinson, had had, and this created a sense of connection to her that I had not felt before. I never met her, as she died in her early thirties, but I knew of her and of her many talents. My home teacher made sure of that. He repeatedly told me what a wonderful musician she was and how much she was loved and missed by our community.
In October 1927 my grandmother directed a stake choir that sang at the dedication of the Mesa Arizona Temple. Although four of the songs she performed with her choir in that dedication were different from the ones I played at the Provo City Center Temple dedication, we both performed the "Hosanna Anthem." Realizing that we would both perform the same song in a temple of the Lord almost ninety years apart was a very sweet experience.
I had other sweet experiences while our choir prepared and rehearsed. Choir members shared their testimonies and tender feelings about the temple, the gospel, and our Savior both in words and song. Everyone was focused on offering his or her very best to the Lord.
In my personal practices I often felt inadequate and worried when I thought about performing in the celestial room, only a few feet away from the Lords apostles and in front of millions of viewers. I tried to calm myself with the feeling that if I put the time into my practice, the Lord would help me. I therefore practiced every day. The footwork with the organ pedals was my biggest challenge. I drilled the arpeggios and foot crossings over and over and over and over - slowly at first, and then I would attempt to speed them up to the performance tempo. Some repetitions went well, and I thought, "I can do this!" But on the very next repetition I would land on a note just adjacent to the one I was aiming for. So I would try again.
One day as I was going through this process, I remembered something I had learned in an acoustics class many years ago when I thought I wanted to be a music teacher. The thought that came i</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As is always the case at the beginning of a new year, I greet you with great pleasure, optimism, and gratitude for our current circumstances and what lies ahead in this winter semester and beyond. Thanks for being with us and for contributing to all that makes Brigham Young University the special and remarkable institution it is. I hope and expect you share my gratitude for these opportunities and also my positive feelings about what we may learn and experience in these first months of 2011.
Last October, during our annual Parents Weekend here on campus, I had the uplifting experience of meeting many parents and also students with whom I was not previously acquainted. I am always encouraged by the inspirational and touching accounts of what brings people to BYU and how they have been blessed and by our shared enthusiasm for this positively unique place.
One mother expressed gratitude that her student could be here while admitting that the adjustment for her daughter had been more difficult than she had anticipated. This thoughtful mother then asked me how our students might increase their chances and opportunities for satisfaction and success at BYU. She was not critical but was anxious to be as helpful as a mother could be in supporting her student in all of the adjustments required by coming to BYU.
The poet Henry David Thoreau once said with respect to achieving satisfaction and success, "If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours" (Walden [1854], 18, Conclusion). I believe this to be true - especially at BYU.
This morning I thought I might reflect on observations, personal experiences, and productive approaches we have observed in others that could be responsive to these questions and hopes concerning ways to find happy achievement while here. I have decided to focus on the BYU experience with the realization that most of the seven suggestions I advance also apply to life in general. At the outset, I confess no particular magic in the choice of the number seven, as there are many more topics that might be included if we were to stay here together all day. Likewise, my use of alliteration in naming these notions might be helpful in remembering them, but other phrases could be easily substituted.
Here are the seven I have chosen for today:
Self-Awareness
Self-Control
Service
Spirituality
Scriptures
Scholarship
Standards
None should be surprising and all might be self-evident. More can be said than I can express in our minutes together, but perhaps you will fill in the blanks where they are most needed for you. The order today is not important, but the propositions advanced are. All are significant and deserve our attention. While for purposes of this presentation I will discuss the seven suggestions separately, you will qu</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, I am honored and humbled to stand before you this day. I appreciate the privilege of speaking to you about the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives. We are blessed to be here at Brigham Young University. It is the Lords university, and at this season we are very fortunate to be a part of this campus life.
I am a beneficiary of the BYU experience. When I arrived on campus many years ago, I did not realize how my time here would influence my future. After my mission my spiritual foundation was firm. Brigham Young University continued to build upon that foundation. It added the walls and the roof, which in turn created a gospel home for my family and me. I will always be thankful for my experience here.
Well, it is the first week of summer term. In fact, it is only the second day of classes. The good news is that you cant be more than two days behind in any of your assignments. As you can tell from my biography, I have always been involved in athletics in one aspect or another: I have participated as an athlete, I have coached, and I am currently serving in athletics administration. Athletics have been a major part of my life. I guess one of the main reasons I take pleasure in athletics is that they closely parallel the game of life. The lessons I have learned through my involvement in athletics have guided me through lifes challenges and successes. Allow me to use some comparisons to illustrate my point.
In athletics one competes against an opponent. The challenger may be the opposing team, yourself, or the clock. In life we have the adversary as our opponent. He creates temptations and discourages us when we are trying our best.
In athletics one has a head coach, assistant coaches, trainers, strength coaches, and academic advisors. In life we have parents, teachers, counselors, Church leaders, and the Head Coach - the Lord Jesus Christ.
In athletics one competes to be challenged or to win an award, trophy, ring, or ribbon. In life we compete for educational pursuits, employment, and worldly possessions. We are also striving to live the commandments for our celestial reward.
In athletics during a competition there are momentum changes. One moment you are up by 12, then minutes later you could be down by two. In life we have peaks and valleys. We experience trials, heartaches, and sadness. We also experience success, peace, happiness, and joy.
In athletics there is pressure to perform in front of a stadium full of fans or spectators. In life we feel pressure to act in front of friends, family, and associates.
In athletics the game may dictate the proper way to manage the clock. In life we are often faced with the pressures of managing our time wisely and prioritizing the tasks at hand.
In athletics one develops physical endurance through conditioning and practice, and one must deal with injuries. In life we learn to have perseverance, patience, a</span>
