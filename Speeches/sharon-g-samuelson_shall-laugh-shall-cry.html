  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.

I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.

I remember a saying that I heard once: "A good laugh a day keeps the blues away." I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep lifes ups and downs in perspective and balance.

Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: "Hey, anybody got a straw?" Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation - especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that its all right, we understand, or were here to help.

In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that "a merry heart doeth good like a medicine." If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, "be of good cheer" (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a result of it.

Each of you is given the choice to be an optimist and smile or be a pessimist and frown. Striving to develop a sense of humor in facing daily tasks is a work in progress. It isnt always an easy or simple trait to acquire. Sometimes it may appear to be impossible. You will face some obstacles in your studies, employment, church callings, interpersonal relationships, and many other undertakings. These are times when you will have the choice of whether to laugh or cry, smile or frown. Sometimes lifes circumstances may seem to be in turmoil, and you may have so much on your so-called "plate" that you dont know where to begin or what to do. This is when I believe humor and the ability to be optimistic can enhance the quality of your life. Elder Hugh B. Brown said, "One must have a sense of humor to be an optimist in times like these" (&lt;i&gt;The Abundant Life&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], 50).

President Gordon B. Hinckley and his wife, Marjorie, were wonderful examples during their lives of optimism and humor. Sheri L. Dews description of them mentions that "Gordon and Marjorie were attracted to each others sense of humor, love for the gospel, innate optimism, and love of life" (&lt;i&gt;Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 106). Sister Dew also described their marriage as one in which "Gordons dry wit delighted Marjorie, who loved the fact that although her beau was practical, self-disciplined, and serious about the things that mattered to him, he didnt take himself very seriously and was often the first to poke fun at his own quirks" (&lt;i&gt;Go Forward,&lt;/i&gt; 106).

Listen to the words of Sister Hinckley as she gave advice on the way to get through life:

&lt;i&gt;Another thing that we tried to do is not take ourselves too seriously. You get into a lot of trouble when you do that. I tried to laugh instead of cry when you felt like crying. It was always better to laugh,&lt;/i&gt;[like] &lt;i&gt;the day I took a beautiful casserole from the oven and my six-year-old boy said, "Mom, how come you baked the garbage?" Children are like that. There are days when it is hard to laugh.&lt;/i&gt;[Marjorie Pay Hinckley, BYU Womens Conference, 2 May 1996; see also Marjorie Hinckley in &lt;i&gt;Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley,&lt;/i&gt; ed. Virginia H. Pearce (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999), 61]

This is insightful advice from a witty, cheerful, and gentle woman that we would be wise to follow.

In another instance of speaking concerning laughter, Sister Hinckley added, "The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache" (Marjorie Pay Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;Small and Simple Things&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2003], 126; also &lt;i&gt;Glimpses,&lt;/i&gt; 107).

Laughing instead of crying helps you to move forward and face your challenges as you fill your lives with the virtuous, lovely, and praiseworthy things of life. Good effects can come from communicating with humor and laughing with friends and family.

Hopefully you are all aware that humor and laughter can also be abused. It must never be used to degrade or embarrass others. It never should involve profanity or the denigration of the sacred and spiritual aspects of your lives. Always be sensitive to the feelings of others. Dont be malicious or thoughtless in words or actions to any of your associates - especially loved ones.

Sometimes, laughing at yourself and with others can create friendships and memories that last forever. Can you find humor in something that happens to you when your choices are to laugh, cry, or possibly become angry? Can you, as was described of President Hinckley, not take yourself too seriously? Each of you has had and will continue to experience these types of incidents. How do you respond?

I enjoy the story of J. Golden Kimball - a General Authority for over fifty years beginning in the 1890s - when he could have responded with anger to an action by another individual. The following was reported by his grandnephew, Jim Kimball:

&lt;i&gt;On a snowy day two weeks before Christmas, he was crossing South Temple to the north door of ZCMI&lt;/i&gt; [a department store in downtown Salt Lake City]. &lt;i&gt;He walked slowly to the middle of the ice-slick street.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A woman burst out of the north door of ZCMI with a pile of packages in her hands and no clear line of sight.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;She plowed right into Golden.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Packages flew everywhere. Golden was knocked down and the woman fell on top of him. Together they began to slide south towards the curb.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;All traffic stopped. Everyone stood entranced by this most unlikely sight.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;They slid until they hit the curb. It was then that the woman realized someone was beneath her. She brushed the snow away and exclaimed, "Oh, Brother Kimball, its you! Speak to me. Are you all right?"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Its all right, Sister, but youll have to get off here," he painfully croaked. "This is as far as I go."&lt;/i&gt; [James Kimball, &lt;i&gt;J. Golden Kimball Stories: Mormonisms Colorful Cowboy&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: White Horse Books, 1999), 90]

The ability to not take oneself too seriously and to use humor in times of mistakes, small and accidental incidents, and stressful situations can help alleviate embarrassment, fear, and even discouragement in circumstances such as these. Elder J. Golden Kimball demonstrated this perfectly.

As mentioned earlier, there are times in our lives when it is very difficult to smile and especially to laugh. There are periods of anguish and suffering when only the gospel perspective brings us comfort as it reminds us of those eternal things that really matter. All of us have had such times in one way or another and will continue to have them in the future. It is part of Gods plan for us. Smiles can come to us, however, as we recall many fond memories of good times, love shared, blessings received, and the knowledge of the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

There is an expression I use at times when life seems to throw an unexpected and unwelcome curveball. It is one I heard years ago, and I have used it many times to put some incidents in perspective. It states: Crisis plus time equals humor. Many times throughout life this can be true. I am sure that each of you can recall some incident in your life when something occurred that caused unhappiness, inconvenience, stress, loss, and so forth that you can laugh and smile about now after the passage of time.

Let me tell you a personal experience as an example of what I mean. Almost twenty years ago my husband and I arrived in Rome, Italy. After disembarking from our flight, we walked to the train station with our son, who spoke Italian, in order to purchase some train tickets to travel in other areas of the country. We set our luggage down by a wall, and I was given the assignment of watching and guarding all of it as my husband and son went to a ticket booth. As I was standing there, silently looking around, a man approached me and spoke in broken English asking about the metro train located right outside the door. At the time the thought came to my mind, "Why is he asking me about the train? He knows I am a tourist and dont know anything." I explained that I was sorry but really couldnt help him, and he went on his way. I continued waiting for my husband and son to return.

When the two returned with the purchased tickets, my husband looked around and with a concerned and puzzled expression on his face asked me, "Where is my briefcase?" It took me only a second to realize why that man had asked me a question he knew I could not answer! There were two doors behind me - one on each side of the luggage. He was distracting me while another equally despicable individual reached around in back of me and stole the briefcase. I ran out of the door to see if I could see him, but, as you would guess, he was nowhere to be seen. I had let myself become distracted from my assignment, and our trip began on a very low note.

Among many assorted items that included my husbands scriptures, we also lost our plane tickets, passports, and some money. To make a long story short, instead of spending our first day seeing the wonderful sites of the Eternal City, we spent it at Delta Airlines and the United States Embassy. You can imagine what my picture looked like on my new passport acquired that day. It will not be shown as a visual aid.

I tried to look for anything positive. For example, maybe he or a family member would read the Book of Mormon and become converted. Then we would receive a note of apology and our stolen items would also be returned. Of course, as of today, it has never happened.

Now you can be assured that there were tears shed - mine. It was not a jovial and comical matter. At the time my husband, son, and I could find no humor in this situation. I felt responsible for creating a circumstance that caused our vacation to be miserable at the outset. However, remember the previous statement: Crisis plus time equals humor. My family and I can now laugh about what happened in Rome, even though at the time it was no laughing matter. We joked the following December that we wouldnt be able to purchase any Christmas presents because Mom let the briefcase get stolen. Now it is truly a memorable part of our family history. We can recall what we felt like then and compare that with what we feel now. This experience created a bond in our family that enables us to know that when mistakes are made, difficult situations arise, and tears are shed, it is our relationship that really matters and the love we have for each other.

In conclusion, my dear friends, I know of no other people in the world who are happier and more cheerful than you, the students of Brigham Young University. When dignitaries and visitors from places throughout the world enter this campus for various reasons - especially those unfamiliar with it - they notice and feel something very different from what they have encountered elsewhere. They comment that you seem so happy. You smile and respond to them in a friendly manner. You like to laugh. You seem to enjoy associating with each other. You impart strength and confidence. They want to know why.

We know why. You are filled with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You are representatives of Him. He told you to be of good cheer, and you are. You are happy because you are striving to achieve worthwhile goals. Amid your daily challenges and struggles you smile, laugh, and encourage others. I so encourage you to continue to do so during your sojourn here and as you "go forth to serve."

I have a testimony that our Heavenly Father lives and that He loves each one of us. We have a prophet, Thomas S. Monson, who is a perfect example of an optimistic and cheerful man. He smiles, he laughs, and he teaches us. May we always listen and follow him is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.</p>
<p>I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.</p>
<p>I remember a saying that I heard once: "A good laugh a day keeps the blues away." I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep lifes ups and downs in perspective and balance.</p>
<p>Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: "Hey, anybody got a straw?" Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation - especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that its all right, we understand, or were here to help.</p>
<p>In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that "a merry heart doeth good like a medicine." If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, "be of good cheer" (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a result of it.</p>
<p>Each of you is given the choice to be an optimist and smile or be a pessimist and frown. Striving to develop a sense of humor in facing daily tasks is a work in progress. It isnt always an easy or simple trait to acquire. Sometimes it may appear to be impossible. You will face some obstacles in your studies, employment, church callings, interpersonal relationships, and many other undertakings. These are times when you will have the choice of whether to laugh or cry, smile or frown. Sometimes lifes circumstances may seem to be in turmoil, and you may have so much on your so-called "plate" that you dont know where to begin or what to do. This is when I believe humor and the ability to be optimistic can enhance the quality of your life. Elder Hugh B. Brown said, "One must have a sense of humor to be an optimist in times like these" (<i>The Abundant Life</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], 50).</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley and his wife, Marjorie, were wonderful examples during their lives of optimism and humor. Sheri L. Dews description of them mentions that "Gordon and Marjorie were attracted to each others sense of humor, love for the gospel, innate optimism, and love of life" (<i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 106). Sister Dew also described their marriage as one in which "Gordons dry wit delighted Marjorie, who loved the fact that although her beau was practical, self-disciplined, and serious about the things that mattered to him, he didnt take himself very seriously and was often the first to poke fun at his own quirks" (<i>Go Forward,</i> 106).</p>
<p>Listen to the words of Sister Hinckley as she gave advice on the way to get through life:</p>
<p><i>Another thing that we tried to do is not take ourselves too seriously. You get into a lot of trouble when you do that. I tried to laugh instead of cry when you felt like crying. It was always better to laugh,</i>[like] <i>the day I took a beautiful casserole from the oven and my six-year-old boy said, "Mom, how come you baked the garbage?" Children are like that. There are days when it is hard to laugh.</i>[Marjorie Pay Hinckley, BYU Womens Conference, 2 May 1996; see also Marjorie Hinckley in <i>Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley,</i> ed. Virginia H. Pearce (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999), 61]</p>
<p>This is insightful advice from a witty, cheerful, and gentle woman that we would be wise to follow.</p>
<p>In another instance of speaking concerning laughter, Sister Hinckley added, "The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache" (Marjorie Pay Hinckley, <i>Small and Simple Things</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2003], 126; also <i>Glimpses,</i> 107).</p>
<p>Laughing instead of crying helps you to move forward and face your challenges as you fill your lives with the virtuous, lovely, and praiseworthy things of life. Good effects can come from communicating with humor and laughing with friends and family.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are all aware that humor and laughter can also be abused. It must never be used to degrade or embarrass others. It never should involve profanity or the denigration of the sacred and spiritual aspects of your lives. Always be sensitive to the feelings of others. Dont be malicious or thoughtless in words or actions to any of your associates - especially loved ones.</p>
<p>Sometimes, laughing at yourself and with others can create friendships and memories that last forever. Can you find humor in something that happens to you when your choices are to laugh, cry, or possibly become angry? Can you, as was described of President Hinckley, not take yourself too seriously? Each of you has had and will continue to experience these types of incidents. How do you respond?</p>
<p>I enjoy the story of J. Golden Kimball - a General Authority for over fifty years beginning in the 1890s - when he could have responded with anger to an action by another individual. The following was reported by his grandnephew, Jim Kimball:</p>
<p><i>On a snowy day two weeks before Christmas, he was crossing South Temple to the north door of ZCMI</i> [a department store in downtown Salt Lake City]. <i>He walked slowly to the middle of the ice-slick street.</i></p>
<p><i>A woman burst out of the north door of ZCMI with a pile of packages in her hands and no clear line of sight.</i></p>
<p><i>She plowed right into Golden.</i></p>
<p><i>Packages flew everywhere. Golden was knocked down and the woman fell on top of him. Together they began to slide south towards the curb.</i></p>
<p><i>All traffic stopped. Everyone stood entranced by this most unlikely sight.</i></p>
<p><i>They slid until they hit the curb. It was then that the woman realized someone was beneath her. She brushed the snow away and exclaimed, "Oh, Brother Kimball, its you! Speak to me. Are you all right?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Its all right, Sister, but youll have to get off here," he painfully croaked. "This is as far as I go."</i> [James Kimball, <i>J. Golden Kimball Stories: Mormonisms Colorful Cowboy</i> (Salt Lake City: White Horse Books, 1999), 90]</p>
<p>The ability to not take oneself too seriously and to use humor in times of mistakes, small and accidental incidents, and stressful situations can help alleviate embarrassment, fear, and even discouragement in circumstances such as these. Elder J. Golden Kimball demonstrated this perfectly.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are times in our lives when it is very difficult to smile and especially to laugh. There are periods of anguish and suffering when only the gospel perspective brings us comfort as it reminds us of those eternal things that really matter. All of us have had such times in one way or another and will continue to have them in the future. It is part of Gods plan for us. Smiles can come to us, however, as we recall many fond memories of good times, love shared, blessings received, and the knowledge of the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>There is an expression I use at times when life seems to throw an unexpected and unwelcome curveball. It is one I heard years ago, and I have used it many times to put some incidents in perspective. It states: Crisis plus time equals humor. Many times throughout life this can be true. I am sure that each of you can recall some incident in your life when something occurred that caused unhappiness, inconvenience, stress, loss, and so forth that you can laugh and smile about now after the passage of time.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a personal experience as an example of what I mean. Almost twenty years ago my husband and I arrived in Rome, Italy. After disembarking from our flight, we walked to the train station with our son, who spoke Italian, in order to purchase some train tickets to travel in other areas of the country. We set our luggage down by a wall, and I was given the assignment of watching and guarding all of it as my husband and son went to a ticket booth. As I was standing there, silently looking around, a man approached me and spoke in broken English asking about the metro train located right outside the door. At the time the thought came to my mind, "Why is he asking me about the train? He knows I am a tourist and dont know anything." I explained that I was sorry but really couldnt help him, and he went on his way. I continued waiting for my husband and son to return.</p>
<p>When the two returned with the purchased tickets, my husband looked around and with a concerned and puzzled expression on his face asked me, "Where is my briefcase?" It took me only a second to realize why that man had asked me a question he knew I could not answer! There were two doors behind me - one on each side of the luggage. He was distracting me while another equally despicable individual reached around in back of me and stole the briefcase. I ran out of the door to see if I could see him, but, as you would guess, he was nowhere to be seen. I had let myself become distracted from my assignment, and our trip began on a very low note.</p>
<p>Among many assorted items that included my husbands scriptures, we also lost our plane tickets, passports, and some money. To make a long story short, instead of spending our first day seeing the wonderful sites of the Eternal City, we spent it at Delta Airlines and the United States Embassy. You can imagine what my picture looked like on my new passport acquired that day. It will not be shown as a visual aid.</p>
<p>I tried to look for anything positive. For example, maybe he or a family member would read the Book of Mormon and become converted. Then we would receive a note of apology and our stolen items would also be returned. Of course, as of today, it has never happened.</p>
<p>Now you can be assured that there were tears shed - mine. It was not a jovial and comical matter. At the time my husband, son, and I could find no humor in this situation. I felt responsible for creating a circumstance that caused our vacation to be miserable at the outset. However, remember the previous statement: Crisis plus time equals humor. My family and I can now laugh about what happened in Rome, even though at the time it was no laughing matter. We joked the following December that we wouldnt be able to purchase any Christmas presents because Mom let the briefcase get stolen. Now it is truly a memorable part of our family history. We can recall what we felt like then and compare that with what we feel now. This experience created a bond in our family that enables us to know that when mistakes are made, difficult situations arise, and tears are shed, it is our relationship that really matters and the love we have for each other.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my dear friends, I know of no other people in the world who are happier and more cheerful than you, the students of Brigham Young University. When dignitaries and visitors from places throughout the world enter this campus for various reasons - especially those unfamiliar with it - they notice and feel something very different from what they have encountered elsewhere. They comment that you seem so happy. You smile and respond to them in a friendly manner. You like to laugh. You seem to enjoy associating with each other. You impart strength and confidence. They want to know why.</p>
<p>We know why. You are filled with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You are representatives of Him. He told you to be of good cheer, and you are. You are happy because you are striving to achieve worthwhile goals. Amid your daily challenges and struggles you smile, laugh, and encourage others. I so encourage you to continue to do so during your sojourn here and as you "go forth to serve."</p>
<p>I have a testimony that our Heavenly Father lives and that He loves each one of us. We have a prophet, Thomas S. Monson, who is a perfect example of an optimistic and cheerful man. He smiles, he laughs, and he teaches us. May we always listen and follow him is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of Gods greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a hearts electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.
When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!
Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.
Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The hearts valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!
In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.
It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.
In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israels new king. As he looked over each of Jesses sons, the Lord taught Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).
Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had "a beautiful countenance" and that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]" (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).
In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. My thanks go to those who provided the music this morning. Their music has helped to bring the Spirit to this meeting. I would hope to speak by that Spirit today.
My late friend Robert J. Matthews, who taught religion here at BYU, used to say, "If I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, you will hear things better than I say them." I pray that that can happen today.
I thought it appropriate to begin with a little poem written by a young man that I think might illustrate what sometimes may happen in parents attempts to change the behavior of their children. He wrote:
My parents told me not to smoke - 
I dont. 
Nor listen to a naughty joke - 
I dont. 
They made it plain I must not wink
At pretty girls, or even think
About intoxicating drink - 
I dont. 
To dance and flirt is very wrong - 
I dont. 
Wild youths chase women, wine and song - 
I dont. 
I kiss no girls, not even one - 
I do not know how it is done - 
You wouldnt think I had much fun - 
I DONT. 
["I Dont," Goldendale Sentinel (Klickatat County, Washington), 24 October 1918, 1, gld.stparchive.com/Archive/GLD/GLD10241918P01.php]
Now, you see that this young mans behavior was changed, but not his attitude. What is needed is a change in attitude as well as behavior. So I pose this question: What causes a change in attitude and behavior?
President Boyd K. Packer stated:
True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. 
The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. . . . That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel. ["Little Children," Ensign, November 1986, 17]
The purpose of my presentation today is to explore four points of doctrine as found in the scriptures and in the words of the Brethren.
Principle Number 1: Draw upon the Power of the Word Daily
The prophet Mormon wrote:
And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just - yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them - therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. [Alma 31:5]
When I taught seminary years ago, I wanted to show the youth the power of the word that Alma described. I wanted to show them that if they would make the word of God (as found in the scriptures) a part of their lives, it would change them. I didnt know exactly how to do that, but I tried this way.
On the first day of class I gave them a blank sheet of paper and s</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesnt begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I cant help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.
I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.
Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!
Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.
What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I dont know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naive sometimes about life. I cant remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:
Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.
I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so m</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During the westward migration, early pioneers encountered landmarks that marked the progress of their journey west. Prominent rock formations such as Chimney Rock and Independence Rock are examples of such landmarks.
Such features have special prominence in our own Church history. Rocky Ridge and Rock Creek Hollow have deep meaning for the handcart pioneers who struggled across the high plains of Wyoming in early snowstorms that terrible winter of 1856.
Hole-in-the-Rock and Dance Hall Rock bring to mind the tenacious faith of those called to settle southeastern Utah. Their expedition stymied by towering cliffs overlooking the Colorado River, these courageous settlers built a road through a cleft in the cliff wall, which even today seems to defy possibility.
My remarks today involve other kinds of rocks. I would like to speak of the stepping-stones and stumbling blocks that define our own spiritual journey through life.
On October 19, 1856, nearly two weeks before the terrible days at Martins Cove, the Martin Handcart Company faced the prospect of making their last crossing of the Platte River. Extremely low on food and supplies, they also faced the prospect of crossing the icy river during a fast-approaching storm. Because of the weakness of the teams that pulled wagons accompanying the handcart company, all of the sick who were able to walk were required to enter the icy water. Thomas Durham recorded, "All the sick that could walk at all had to get out of the wagons and walk through the river, some of them falling down in the river several times, not being able to stand up in it being so weak" (Thomas Durham journal, 18541871, 15).
While the place of crossing was a known location to ford the river, the freezing water was at least waist deep to most of the 200 to 300 souls who waded and swam the river.
Josiah Rogerson recalled the experience years later by writing, "I rolled up my trousers and waded that cold river, six or eight rods wide, slipping betimes off the smooth stones and boulders into deeper water" ("Strong Men, Brave Women and Sturdy Children Crossed the Wilderness Afoot," in Salt Lake Tribune, 4 January 1914, n.p.).
Between the last crossing of the Platte River and the arrival of the advance party of rescuers, fifty-six members of the handcart company perished. Many more lost their lives during those horrible days at Martins Cove as they waited for the main rescue party.
Because of the horrible suffering experienced by the Willie and Martin handcart companies, a few of the survivors lost their faith and left the Church. But to many who suffered, this experience proved to be the refiners fire.
Forty-eight years later, in a Sunday School class in Cedar City, Utah, class members were offering criticism of the Church and its leaders for permitting the handcart companies to cross the plains so poorly equipped and so late in the season. Francis</span>
