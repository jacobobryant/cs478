  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My brothers and sisters, its a pleasure to be here today. Many thoughts went through my mind as I prepared for this occasion. I wanted to make sure that I deliver the kind of a message that is going to be helpful. I hope the Spirit will be with me that I might do just that.

The subject will be that of marriage, with an eternal perspective. &lt;i&gt;Temple marriage &lt;/i&gt;describes the place you go to have the marriage performed. &lt;i&gt;Celestial marriage &lt;/i&gt;is being true to the sacred covenants you make in that temple marriage ceremony - living celestial principles in the marriage relationship.

A celestial marriage requires, after the vows are taken, a continuing consecrated life of worthiness leading to happiness and exaltation, which President Kimball has talked to you about. If we live the laws properly, as they are intended, we will, with another individual and with our family, be able to have a little heaven on earth. We are practicing, when we live the laws pertaining to celestial marriage, the same laws that are practiced in heaven. We are practicing how to live with God the Father and his Son and with our families in the eternities to come. That to me is the message to the world of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

So my title this morning is "Celestial Marriage - A Little Heaven on Earth." I would like to reinforce in your minds the principle of celestial marriage and the gospel lesson it gives to us.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goals for Righteous Living&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Something as wonderful as a celestial marriage doesnt just happen.

In the story &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland, &lt;/i&gt;Alice approaches the Cheshire Cat and asks, "Would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?"

The Cheshire Cat replies, "That depends a great deal on where you want to go."

Alice says, "I admit, I dont much care where."

The Cheshire Cat then says, "Then it doesnt really matter much which way you go, does it?"

"Just so I get somewhere," responds Alice.

Then the Cheshire Cat reveals an interesting truth, "Oh, youre sure to get there if you keep walking long enough."

What is the message? How many of us are going through life today telling ourselves, "If we keep going long enough, were going to get somewhere," but are not defining exactly where that place is we want to be? "Somewhere" is not good enough. We must know where we want to go and be firmly committed to getting there. And we should get that knowledge and commitment early.

Alma stated, "Oh, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35). That says it all. Do it now.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Temple Recommends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Once we are committed to a celestial marriage, we should understand and do the things that lead to it:

To enter the temple, you will need what is called a recommend. A searching interview will be conducted first by your bishop and then by your stake president.

First, they will ask, "Do you have a testimony of the gospel?"

Second, "Do you support your local leaders and the General Authorities? Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a prophet, seer, and revelator, recognizing no other person on earth as authorized to hold all of the keys of the priesthood? Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local authorities in your stake and ward?"

Third, "Do you accept and follow the teachings and programs of the Church? By that we mean, do you earnestly strive to live in accordance with the accepted rules and doctrines of the Church?" Further, "Do you have affiliation with or sympathy with any groups or individuals who teach or practice doctrines which are not officially sanctioned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?"

Fourth, "Do you keep the Word of Wisdom, including abstinence from the use of harmful drugs?"

Fifth, "Are you morally clean? Are you free from adultery, fornication, homosexuality, and all of the other moral transgressions that confront you in this life?"

Sixth, "Are you a full tithe payer?"

Seventh, "Are you totally honest in your dealings with your fellowmen?"

Eighth, "Will you and do you regularly wear your temple garments, if you have already been to the temple?"

Ninth, "Are you a member in good standing in the Church? By that we mean, will you earnestly strive to do your duty in the Church, to attend your sacrament, priesthood, and other meetings, and to obey the rules, laws, and commandments of the Church and of God?" Next, "Is anything amiss in your life that has not been fully resolved with your appropriate priesthood authorities that should be cleared up at this time?"

Tenth, "Are you free of legal entanglements?"

Eleventh, "Do you consider yourself worthy in every way to go to the temple?"

The importance of thinking of this recommend in connection with marriage is that, when you choose the companion youre going to live with for time and all eternity, you should ask yourself, "Am I sure he or she is able to live within the confines of this recommend?"
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Endowment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
After you obtain a recommend, you may then go to the temple and receive an endowment. Before a person can be married or sealed as husband or wife in the temple, he or she receives the ordinances of the endowment. What is the temple endowment? In the &lt;i&gt;Discourses of Brigham Young &lt;/i&gt;we read:

&lt;i&gt;Let me give you a definition in brief. Your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the lord which are necessary for you after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, being enabled to give them the key words, the signs and tokens pertaining to the holy priesthood and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth or hell.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Discourses of Brigham Young &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941), p. 416]

"The endowment," Elder ElRay L. Christiansen has said, "is a most important and significant blessing, and the Lord desires his worthy children to receive it" (&lt;i&gt;Temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1976&lt;/i&gt;).

Elder James E. Talmage, formerly of the Council of the Twelve, spoke very significantly of the temple endowment as it is administered in our modern temples when he said:

&lt;i&gt;It comprises instruction relating to the significance and sequence of past dispensations, the importance of the present as the greatest and grandest era of human history. This course of instruction includes a recital of the most prominent events of the creative period, the condition of our first parents in the Garden of Eden, their disobedience and consequent expulsion from that blissful abode, their condition in the lone and dreary world when doomed to live by labor and sweat, the plan of redemption by which the great transgression may be atoned, the period of the great apostasy, the restoration of the gospel with all its ancient powers and privileges, the absolute and indispensable condition of personal purity and devotion to the right in present life, and a strict compliance with gospel requirements.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part of the individual, such as covenant and promise to observe the law of strict virtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent, tolerant and pure; to devote both talent and material means to the spread of truth and the uplifting of the race; to maintain devotion to the cause of truth; and to seek in every way to contribute to the great preparation that the earth may be made ready to receive her King, - the Lord Jesus Christ. With the taking of each covenant and the assuming of each obligation, a promised blessing is pronounced, contingent upon the faithful observation of the conditions.&lt;/i&gt;

Elder Talmage also said that "no jot, iota, or tittle of the temple rites is otherwise than uplifting and sanctifying" (James E. Talmage, &lt;i&gt;The House of the Lord &lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968], pp. 83, 84).

So it is that we have the privilege as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to plan for and prepare for a celestial marriage. It is your parents responsibility to teach this early in your life. It is your responsibility to teach it to your children. It should be taught at family home evening. Pictures of a temple should be in your home. I hope that in your room here at college you have a picture of a temple.

President Kimball told a story at the dedication of the St. George Temple of a mother with three boys. Their father had gone off to sea, never to return. As a reminder of her husband, and to remind the boys not to go to sea, she put up a picture in her living room of a beautiful clipper ship sailing on the ocean. Every day she stood there and told the boys, "Never go to sea." There isnt a mother here who doesnt know what happened. All three boys went to sea. Why? Because when they looked at that picture, they saw the adventure their father saw: the wind and the sails of that great clipper ship, the spray coming up. The visual image had a powerful effect upon the boys desires. And so it is that President Kimball has indicated, "Wouldnt it be well to put up a picture of the temple in our homes and give that same adventure to your children, that they might set the objective for themselves to go to the temple?"
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selecting a Companion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The selection of a companion is what I would like to talk about next. You are here at an important period of your life, and are asking yourself, "What is marriage all about? How do I find the right person to marry?" Let me suggest an approach. Measure the spiritual level of your potential future companions. First, if they are members, are they active and fully committed? Are they passive? Are they antagonistic? Second, if they are not members, are they receptive to the gospel and its teachings? Are they non-committal or antagonistic?

Id like to spend just a moment, drawing from twenty years of priesthood work, to talk to you on this. If you marry an active member in the temple, marry for time and all eternity in the new and everlasting covenant, will you have problems? Yes. Will you be able to solve them? Yes. Will your chance be better to solve the problems and strengthen your testimony than if you had not married in the temple? Yes. My brothers and sisters, if you marry somebody who is antagonistic to the Church or passive, I merely want to say one thing to you. You are placing yourself in a position where you will find, someday, that you will have to choose between that individual and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That is a very heavy responsibility.

When you are choosing your companion, make sure that both of you have a desire for a celestial marriage relationship, a desire to have a family for eternity, a desire to have a companion for eternity and to live in the presence of our Heavenly Father.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Lord has made it clear that we can be together in eternity with our companion only if we abide the law. In modern revelation he says, "Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same. For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant" (D&amp;amp;C 132:34). Every member of the Church should read and study section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Do you realize that, when one has the responsibility to be a sealer in the temple and has these keys, there is no one between him and God when that ordinance is performed? There is no priesthood authority between them, you and your loved one at the altar, and God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. It is a beautiful and a touching ceremony.

The deep underlying purpose of temple marriage was clarified by the Redeemer himself when he said, "And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God" (D&amp;amp;C 132:6).

The Lord said also in that same section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 132:15). Do we really realize that in the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that unless we enter into celestial marriage we cannot reach the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom? It is also clear what will happen to those who never receive the blessings of the temple marriage, and that is that their binding is until "death do thee part" - a very sad thing to contemplate.

The aim of the gospel and the purpose of celestial marriage are not only to keep us together, but also to make us eligible for our Heavenly Fathers highest reward, exaltation in the celestial kingdom, increase in that kingdom, and being together with our families.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Each Other&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I would now like to discuss the partnership aspect of marriage and family life.

Let us talk frankly for a moment. Marriage is like climbing a mountain. You tie yourself to a companion, and you start up the mountain of life. As a child comes along, you tie him to mom and dad and continue your journey. The ropes will hold all of the mountain climbers together. But there are many elements - the wind and the rain and the snow and the ice - all the elements of the world will tear at you to pull you off that eternal mountain. How do you reach the summit? If either mom or dad cuts the rope which binds them, chances are that one or the other may fall off the mountain and perhaps pull down some of the rest of the family. The whole family could fall off that gospel mountain and not reach that eternal summit. Let us always be mindful that, as older brothers and sisters, you are also tied to this mountain team that is attempting to return back into the presence of your Heavenly Father. If you cut the rope that binds you to mom and dad and fall off the mountain - chances are that you will take one or two of your brothers and sisters with you. You cant take that chance. You, by definition, are a leader.

Someone has said it this way: "Thee lift me, and Ill lift thee, and well ascend together." What does that mean? I can remember an experience in my life that illustrates this idea. I was at Harvard Business School. I was stretched to my capacity. In the first year of that institution, the teachers take away every bit of self-confidence you have, no matter what your background is before you get there, so that you learn what its like to have to achieve more than youve ever done in your life before. The program is designed to teach you how to think under pressure. They try to duplicate real life.

At an important point in my schooling, a mission president, John E. Carr, asked me to be an elders quorum president. It is the only time in my life that I ever questioned an assignment. I went home to talk to my wife. For every woman here and every man here the question will come in life, "When is the time to serve? When is the right time?" The only answer I can give you is, "When you are asked." So I went home and said to my wife, "There is a chance of failing in my schooling if I become an elders quorum president." She said to me the words which have helped for many years: "Bob, I would rather have an active priesthood holder than a man who holds a masters degree from Harvard." But as she put her arms around me, she said, "Well do them both." That is eternal partnership.

"Thee lift me, and Ill lift thee, and well ascend together" - thats the message.

A marriage partnership is not a crutch. You do not marry somebody you think is a little higher than the angels and then lean on him. You develop yourself and your own gifts and talents. As each partner develops, you grow together, supporting and strengthening one another.

My wife has always supported me. We sat down before we were married, and I said to her, "You know, Mary, I feel that to be successful in business I will have to work hard domestically and perhaps internationally. Do you want to go on that trip with me?" She said she did. Ten years after we were married, I was asked to go to England, and there she was with me. Then we went to Germany, and then to Spain. She became international, bicultural, bilingual, because she had made her mind up that we would work and develop together.

Remember, if you would, to treat each other in kindness, to respect each other for who you are and what you want to be.

I would like to tell you the story of a woman who was in my ward some years ago when I was a bishop. She and her husband were having a marriage problem. As they spoke with me, she began to tear down her husband in all those key areas that a man must have to have some respect for himself. She alked of his inadequacy as a father, his inadequacies in marital relations, his inadequacy as a provider, his inadequacies socially, contrasted with what she had expected. I asked her, "Why do you do this to a man you should love and sustain?" She said, "Oh, its much better to argue with someone you love because you know where you can hurt them the most." And she &lt;i&gt;meant &lt;/i&gt;it.

Now lets think about that for a minute. Can you really hurt a stranger? Who are the people you can hurt the most? Is it your roommate? Is it your companion? Is it your mom and dad? Is it your brother or sister? Isnt it true that while youre at this institution you should learn how to strengthen those around you, not tear them down? Shouldnt you be developing an attitude with your roommates so that it becomes a natural part of you to be supportive and helpful? You share your strengths and weaknesses with their strengths and weaknesses, again, as you climb that mountain together and help one another.

The hero of Homers &lt;i&gt;Iliad, &lt;/i&gt;Achilles, had a mother, Thetis, who dipped Achilles in the waters of the River Styx so that he became invulnerable, the story goes, except for that part of his heel by which she held him. There he was unprotected. From this story has come the idea of the proverbial Achilles heel. Everybody in this room has an Achilles heel. Achilles was the bravest, handsomest, swiftest of the army of Agamemnon, but he was slain by Paris, whose arrow was guided by Apollo to his vulnerable heel. Every mother would love to dip her children into the waters of the River Styx and give them protection, but this is impossible. We must learn to use our free agency and take our opportunities for growth. Everyone has his weaknesses. The adversary knows our Achilles heels. He knows the Achilles heels of your loved ones, your friends, your roommates, your brothers and sisters, your parents. Do &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;understand your Achilles heel? Do you know the situations you have to stay away from and what your weaknesses are? Sit down and talk to yourself, because the secret of a happy marriage is to protect the Achilles heels of those you love and not take advantage of the weaknesses of those you know the best, love the most, and ultimately can hurt the most.

In the Doctrine and Covenants (I would hope each one of you would write this verse down and put it in your pocket and have it with you at all times for those challenging moments) we read, "Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings" (D&amp;amp;C 108:7). In other words, every day you help one another as you speak, as you pray, in your exhortations, and in your doings.

Working together is a sacrifice. You have to make sure that the person youre dating right now is going to be willing to sacrifice. Ill give you one story in life that helped me learn this. I can remember a young couple just out of college. One parent gave them a home; the other parent gave them the furnishings and a new car. They had everything. They were beautiful people and they were popular. They had everything in the world given to them. Well, you know the story. Within three years they were divorced. They hadnt worked and sacrificed. They had leaned on each other and on their parents as a crutch, had crippled themselves, and hadnt grown. They hadnt learned the hard part. They hadnt worried about making their marriage work. How do you support your wife? What is the role of a priesthood holder? What is the role of a woman with the priesthood? Again, its making sure that you share and grow together.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family Support in Church Callings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My wife has taught me to grow in a number of ways, one of which Ill share with you for a moment. (Usually its a little easier to tell this story when shes not with me. Shes here today, and Im sure Ill be talked with afterwards.) After serving as an elders quorum president, a branch president, and a bishop over a period of five years, we moved to a new stake. The stake president recognized the great leadership talents of my wife. In fact, Ive spent most of my life being known as the husband of Mary Hales, but I dont mind that. My wife was asked to be a Relief Society president, which she has been twice in her life. (As Ive been a bishop three times, weve shared our priesthood and our Relief Society responsibilities.) She went to her first meeting with the bishop, a welfare meeting and a priesthood correlation meeting, while I chased two youngsters up and down the halls, through the parking lot, through the cultural hall, and had my first experience with waiting. I waited one and a half hours. When she came out, I had one boy in my arm and was holding the other by the hand. As the door opened and she came out of the bishops office, I had that look on my face. You know the look. I didnt have the courage to say anything, but I just gave her a look that said, "Do you realize youve kept me waiting an hour and a half?" All she did was raise five fingers and say, "Five years." That is how long she had been waiting for me. Then I began to realize it was going to be my job to support my wife in her calling just as she had supported me as a priesthood holder. There isnt a man here who cant learn from that story.

Ive heard of one husband who, on a Tuesday evening, was putting on his blue suit, his white shirt, and his blue tie. His wife asked him, "Where are you going?" His answer was very clear: "Im going to Relief Society. One of us has to go." That story would warm the heart of every Relief Society president in the world.

At the University of Utah, in an evening seminar, I was speaking to the M.B.A.s and senior business students. I noticed a young man with a baby sitting alone near the front of the hall. Afterwards he came up and spoke to me, still holding the baby. He had a few questions about his career. I said, "Where is your wife?" He said, "Well, when we were married, I promised her that she would have the opportunity of attending Relief Society. Tonight is Relief Society, and so I have our son at this seminar."

Every woman here should understand the importance of Relief Society in her marriage, and every priesthood holder should understand it.

I travel to stakes now, and I have learned that about one out of every five women, on average, goes to Relief Society. Sisters, start your habit of going to Relief Society at Brigham Young University. And brethren, you start your habit of supporting them in this activity. It is one of the most important chances theyll have for continuing education, for feeling self-worth, for being able to share testimonies in a testimony meeting.

There will be times when your wives will say to themselves that they wont be able to get through another day. There will be two or three children around the house, theyll be speaking on the level of a two- or three- or five-year-old, and at some point they will want to get out and have some cultural refinement. They will want to experience some growing. So it is that the testimony meeting helps your wives to share their feelings with each other. It also helps those of you women who will be alone, who may not have a partner. You should go to Relief Society for the association you will find there. It will help every woman in the Church to grow, to have new experiences. Someday you will go to Relief Society and hear someone bear her testimony; it will make you feel as though life is worth it.

There are two major reasons why women dont go to Relief Society. First, women do not know how important it is to them individually for their growth, or they dont know how important it is for their families and for their companionship with their husbands. Second, some priesthood holders do not support their wives and do not understand why it is important for them.

May I give just one last suggestion. When your companion is gone to Relief Society and youre all alone, youll have some of the best "memory moments" with your children. Thats also the time, maybe, to do a few dishes and to clean up the house a little bit, so that when she returns home she doesnt feel as though she has the weight of the world on her shoulders.

Many men feel that the physical part of their relationship in marriage is the most important part. But I want to tell each and everyone of you, very personally, that to clean a few dishes, vacuum a room, and have all of the kids in bed when mom comes home has got to be one of the most rewarding experiences your wife will ever have in marriage. Its a much better way, at times, of expressing your feelings than saying, "I love you."

You two also have to ask, as you travel through life in your marriage, "What are the anticipated problems if we dont follow the counsel which weve talked of today? What can we expect if we disregard the counsel of the Brethren, of the President of the Church, and of those who will counsel us on a temple marriage?" Thinking seriously about the answers to those questions may inspire us to do what is right.

In closing, I would like to give you my testimony. How I realize the importance of setting your course, of knowing where you are going. I ask the Lords blessings to be with you so that you will not lean on one another as a crutch, but youll both stand strong. Strengthen each other. Ask for help as you pray each night. Please date extensively. Please know the kind of person you want to be with. Please make sure that you help those you come in contact with. Please point them in the direction of associating with many people.

And please make sure that none of you sets an artificial goal for those you are going to marry. If you say, "Ill go with you or marry you if you go on a mission, or if youll marry in the temple," and if that isnt what they feel inside they want to do, fifteen or twenty years from now you may have a tragic circumstance. Make sure that you know before you get married what that person really wants to be inside. You can do that by seeing if he goes to his meetings and has a testimony and can talk to you about eternal goals, now.

I ask the Lords blessings to be with you. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I bear testimony to you that those moments in my life when I have been unhappy, depressed, or sad are when I have deviated, even in a minor degree, from the teachings of the Lord. That you might have true happiness and find the joy of a celestial marriage with a little heaven on earth is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My brothers and sisters, its a pleasure to be here today. Many thoughts went through my mind as I prepared for this occasion. I wanted to make sure that I deliver the kind of a message that is going to be helpful. I hope the Spirit will be with me that I might do just that.</p>
<p>The subject will be that of marriage, with an eternal perspective. <i>Temple marriage </i>describes the place you go to have the marriage performed. <i>Celestial marriage </i>is being true to the sacred covenants you make in that temple marriage ceremony - living celestial principles in the marriage relationship.</p>
<p>A celestial marriage requires, after the vows are taken, a continuing consecrated life of worthiness leading to happiness and exaltation, which President Kimball has talked to you about. If we live the laws properly, as they are intended, we will, with another individual and with our family, be able to have a little heaven on earth. We are practicing, when we live the laws pertaining to celestial marriage, the same laws that are practiced in heaven. We are practicing how to live with God the Father and his Son and with our families in the eternities to come. That to me is the message to the world of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>So my title this morning is "Celestial Marriage - A Little Heaven on Earth." I would like to reinforce in your minds the principle of celestial marriage and the gospel lesson it gives to us.</p>
<h2><b>Goals for Righteous Living</b></h2>
<p>Something as wonderful as a celestial marriage doesnt just happen.</p>
<p>In the story <i>Alice in Wonderland, </i>Alice approaches the Cheshire Cat and asks, "Would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?"</p>
<p>The Cheshire Cat replies, "That depends a great deal on where you want to go."</p>
<p>Alice says, "I admit, I dont much care where."</p>
<p>The Cheshire Cat then says, "Then it doesnt really matter much which way you go, does it?"</p>
<p>"Just so I get somewhere," responds Alice.</p>
<p>Then the Cheshire Cat reveals an interesting truth, "Oh, youre sure to get there if you keep walking long enough."</p>
<p>What is the message? How many of us are going through life today telling ourselves, "If we keep going long enough, were going to get somewhere," but are not defining exactly where that place is we want to be? "Somewhere" is not good enough. We must know where we want to go and be firmly committed to getting there. And we should get that knowledge and commitment early.</p>
<p>Alma stated, "Oh, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35). That says it all. Do it now.</p>
<h2><b>Temple Recommends</b></h2>
<p>Once we are committed to a celestial marriage, we should understand and do the things that lead to it:</p>
<p>To enter the temple, you will need what is called a recommend. A searching interview will be conducted first by your bishop and then by your stake president.</p>
<p>First, they will ask, "Do you have a testimony of the gospel?"</p>
<p>Second, "Do you support your local leaders and the General Authorities? Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a prophet, seer, and revelator, recognizing no other person on earth as authorized to hold all of the keys of the priesthood? Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local authorities in your stake and ward?"</p>
<p>Third, "Do you accept and follow the teachings and programs of the Church? By that we mean, do you earnestly strive to live in accordance with the accepted rules and doctrines of the Church?" Further, "Do you have affiliation with or sympathy with any groups or individuals who teach or practice doctrines which are not officially sanctioned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?"</p>
<p>Fourth, "Do you keep the Word of Wisdom, including abstinence from the use of harmful drugs?"</p>
<p>Fifth, "Are you morally clean? Are you free from adultery, fornication, homosexuality, and all of the other moral transgressions that confront you in this life?"</p>
<p>Sixth, "Are you a full tithe payer?"</p>
<p>Seventh, "Are you totally honest in your dealings with your fellowmen?"</p>
<p>Eighth, "Will you and do you regularly wear your temple garments, if you have already been to the temple?"</p>
<p>Ninth, "Are you a member in good standing in the Church? By that we mean, will you earnestly strive to do your duty in the Church, to attend your sacrament, priesthood, and other meetings, and to obey the rules, laws, and commandments of the Church and of God?" Next, "Is anything amiss in your life that has not been fully resolved with your appropriate priesthood authorities that should be cleared up at this time?"</p>
<p>Tenth, "Are you free of legal entanglements?"</p>
<p>Eleventh, "Do you consider yourself worthy in every way to go to the temple?"</p>
<p>The importance of thinking of this recommend in connection with marriage is that, when you choose the companion youre going to live with for time and all eternity, you should ask yourself, "Am I sure he or she is able to live within the confines of this recommend?"</p>
<h2><b>The Endowment</b></h2>
<p>After you obtain a recommend, you may then go to the temple and receive an endowment. Before a person can be married or sealed as husband or wife in the temple, he or she receives the ordinances of the endowment. What is the temple endowment? In the <i>Discourses of Brigham Young </i>we read:</p>
<p><i>Let me give you a definition in brief. Your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the lord which are necessary for you after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, being enabled to give them the key words, the signs and tokens pertaining to the holy priesthood and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth or hell.</i> [<i>Discourses of Brigham Young </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941), p. 416]</p>
<p>"The endowment," Elder ElRay L. Christiansen has said, "is a most important and significant blessing, and the Lord desires his worthy children to receive it" (<i>Temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1976</i>).</p>
<p>Elder James E. Talmage, formerly of the Council of the Twelve, spoke very significantly of the temple endowment as it is administered in our modern temples when he said:</p>
<p><i>It comprises instruction relating to the significance and sequence of past dispensations, the importance of the present as the greatest and grandest era of human history. This course of instruction includes a recital of the most prominent events of the creative period, the condition of our first parents in the Garden of Eden, their disobedience and consequent expulsion from that blissful abode, their condition in the lone and dreary world when doomed to live by labor and sweat, the plan of redemption by which the great transgression may be atoned, the period of the great apostasy, the restoration of the gospel with all its ancient powers and privileges, the absolute and indispensable condition of personal purity and devotion to the right in present life, and a strict compliance with gospel requirements.</i></p>
<p><i>The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part of the individual, such as covenant and promise to observe the law of strict virtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent, tolerant and pure; to devote both talent and material means to the spread of truth and the uplifting of the race; to maintain devotion to the cause of truth; and to seek in every way to contribute to the great preparation that the earth may be made ready to receive her King, - the Lord Jesus Christ. With the taking of each covenant and the assuming of each obligation, a promised blessing is pronounced, contingent upon the faithful observation of the conditions.</i></p>
<p>Elder Talmage also said that "no jot, iota, or tittle of the temple rites is otherwise than uplifting and sanctifying" (James E. Talmage, <i>The House of the Lord </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968], pp. 83, 84).</p>
<p>So it is that we have the privilege as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to plan for and prepare for a celestial marriage. It is your parents responsibility to teach this early in your life. It is your responsibility to teach it to your children. It should be taught at family home evening. Pictures of a temple should be in your home. I hope that in your room here at college you have a picture of a temple.</p>
<p>President Kimball told a story at the dedication of the St. George Temple of a mother with three boys. Their father had gone off to sea, never to return. As a reminder of her husband, and to remind the boys not to go to sea, she put up a picture in her living room of a beautiful clipper ship sailing on the ocean. Every day she stood there and told the boys, "Never go to sea." There isnt a mother here who doesnt know what happened. All three boys went to sea. Why? Because when they looked at that picture, they saw the adventure their father saw: the wind and the sails of that great clipper ship, the spray coming up. The visual image had a powerful effect upon the boys desires. And so it is that President Kimball has indicated, "Wouldnt it be well to put up a picture of the temple in our homes and give that same adventure to your children, that they might set the objective for themselves to go to the temple?"</p>
<h2><b>Selecting a Companion</b></h2>
<p>The selection of a companion is what I would like to talk about next. You are here at an important period of your life, and are asking yourself, "What is marriage all about? How do I find the right person to marry?" Let me suggest an approach. Measure the spiritual level of your potential future companions. First, if they are members, are they active and fully committed? Are they passive? Are they antagonistic? Second, if they are not members, are they receptive to the gospel and its teachings? Are they non-committal or antagonistic?</p>
<p>Id like to spend just a moment, drawing from twenty years of priesthood work, to talk to you on this. If you marry an active member in the temple, marry for time and all eternity in the new and everlasting covenant, will you have problems? Yes. Will you be able to solve them? Yes. Will your chance be better to solve the problems and strengthen your testimony than if you had not married in the temple? Yes. My brothers and sisters, if you marry somebody who is antagonistic to the Church or passive, I merely want to say one thing to you. You are placing yourself in a position where you will find, someday, that you will have to choose between that individual and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That is a very heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>When you are choosing your companion, make sure that both of you have a desire for a celestial marriage relationship, a desire to have a family for eternity, a desire to have a companion for eternity and to live in the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
<h2><b>The New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage</b></h2>
<p>The Lord has made it clear that we can be together in eternity with our companion only if we abide the law. In modern revelation he says, "Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same. For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant" (D&amp;C 132:34). Every member of the Church should read and study section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Do you realize that, when one has the responsibility to be a sealer in the temple and has these keys, there is no one between him and God when that ordinance is performed? There is no priesthood authority between them, you and your loved one at the altar, and God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. It is a beautiful and a touching ceremony.</p>
<p>The deep underlying purpose of temple marriage was clarified by the Redeemer himself when he said, "And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God" (D&amp;C 132:6).</p>
<p>The Lord said also in that same section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world" (D&amp;C 132:15). Do we really realize that in the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that unless we enter into celestial marriage we cannot reach the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom? It is also clear what will happen to those who never receive the blessings of the temple marriage, and that is that their binding is until "death do thee part" - a very sad thing to contemplate.</p>
<p>The aim of the gospel and the purpose of celestial marriage are not only to keep us together, but also to make us eligible for our Heavenly Fathers highest reward, exaltation in the celestial kingdom, increase in that kingdom, and being together with our families.</p>
<h2><b>Supporting Each Other</b></h2>
<p>I would now like to discuss the partnership aspect of marriage and family life.</p>
<p>Let us talk frankly for a moment. Marriage is like climbing a mountain. You tie yourself to a companion, and you start up the mountain of life. As a child comes along, you tie him to mom and dad and continue your journey. The ropes will hold all of the mountain climbers together. But there are many elements - the wind and the rain and the snow and the ice - all the elements of the world will tear at you to pull you off that eternal mountain. How do you reach the summit? If either mom or dad cuts the rope which binds them, chances are that one or the other may fall off the mountain and perhaps pull down some of the rest of the family. The whole family could fall off that gospel mountain and not reach that eternal summit. Let us always be mindful that, as older brothers and sisters, you are also tied to this mountain team that is attempting to return back into the presence of your Heavenly Father. If you cut the rope that binds you to mom and dad and fall off the mountain - chances are that you will take one or two of your brothers and sisters with you. You cant take that chance. You, by definition, are a leader.</p>
<p>Someone has said it this way: "Thee lift me, and Ill lift thee, and well ascend together." What does that mean? I can remember an experience in my life that illustrates this idea. I was at Harvard Business School. I was stretched to my capacity. In the first year of that institution, the teachers take away every bit of self-confidence you have, no matter what your background is before you get there, so that you learn what its like to have to achieve more than youve ever done in your life before. The program is designed to teach you how to think under pressure. They try to duplicate real life.</p>
<p>At an important point in my schooling, a mission president, John E. Carr, asked me to be an elders quorum president. It is the only time in my life that I ever questioned an assignment. I went home to talk to my wife. For every woman here and every man here the question will come in life, "When is the time to serve? When is the right time?" The only answer I can give you is, "When you are asked." So I went home and said to my wife, "There is a chance of failing in my schooling if I become an elders quorum president." She said to me the words which have helped for many years: "Bob, I would rather have an active priesthood holder than a man who holds a masters degree from Harvard." But as she put her arms around me, she said, "Well do them both." That is eternal partnership.</p>
<p>"Thee lift me, and Ill lift thee, and well ascend together" - thats the message.</p>
<p>A marriage partnership is not a crutch. You do not marry somebody you think is a little higher than the angels and then lean on him. You develop yourself and your own gifts and talents. As each partner develops, you grow together, supporting and strengthening one another.</p>
<p>My wife has always supported me. We sat down before we were married, and I said to her, "You know, Mary, I feel that to be successful in business I will have to work hard domestically and perhaps internationally. Do you want to go on that trip with me?" She said she did. Ten years after we were married, I was asked to go to England, and there she was with me. Then we went to Germany, and then to Spain. She became international, bicultural, bilingual, because she had made her mind up that we would work and develop together.</p>
<p>Remember, if you would, to treat each other in kindness, to respect each other for who you are and what you want to be.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you the story of a woman who was in my ward some years ago when I was a bishop. She and her husband were having a marriage problem. As they spoke with me, she began to tear down her husband in all those key areas that a man must have to have some respect for himself. She alked of his inadequacy as a father, his inadequacies in marital relations, his inadequacy as a provider, his inadequacies socially, contrasted with what she had expected. I asked her, "Why do you do this to a man you should love and sustain?" She said, "Oh, its much better to argue with someone you love because you know where you can hurt them the most." And she <i>meant </i>it.</p>
<p>Now lets think about that for a minute. Can you really hurt a stranger? Who are the people you can hurt the most? Is it your roommate? Is it your companion? Is it your mom and dad? Is it your brother or sister? Isnt it true that while youre at this institution you should learn how to strengthen those around you, not tear them down? Shouldnt you be developing an attitude with your roommates so that it becomes a natural part of you to be supportive and helpful? You share your strengths and weaknesses with their strengths and weaknesses, again, as you climb that mountain together and help one another.</p>
<p>The hero of Homers <i>Iliad, </i>Achilles, had a mother, Thetis, who dipped Achilles in the waters of the River Styx so that he became invulnerable, the story goes, except for that part of his heel by which she held him. There he was unprotected. From this story has come the idea of the proverbial Achilles heel. Everybody in this room has an Achilles heel. Achilles was the bravest, handsomest, swiftest of the army of Agamemnon, but he was slain by Paris, whose arrow was guided by Apollo to his vulnerable heel. Every mother would love to dip her children into the waters of the River Styx and give them protection, but this is impossible. We must learn to use our free agency and take our opportunities for growth. Everyone has his weaknesses. The adversary knows our Achilles heels. He knows the Achilles heels of your loved ones, your friends, your roommates, your brothers and sisters, your parents. Do <i>you </i>understand your Achilles heel? Do you know the situations you have to stay away from and what your weaknesses are? Sit down and talk to yourself, because the secret of a happy marriage is to protect the Achilles heels of those you love and not take advantage of the weaknesses of those you know the best, love the most, and ultimately can hurt the most.</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants (I would hope each one of you would write this verse down and put it in your pocket and have it with you at all times for those challenging moments) we read, "Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings" (D&amp;C 108:7). In other words, every day you help one another as you speak, as you pray, in your exhortations, and in your doings.</p>
<p>Working together is a sacrifice. You have to make sure that the person youre dating right now is going to be willing to sacrifice. Ill give you one story in life that helped me learn this. I can remember a young couple just out of college. One parent gave them a home; the other parent gave them the furnishings and a new car. They had everything. They were beautiful people and they were popular. They had everything in the world given to them. Well, you know the story. Within three years they were divorced. They hadnt worked and sacrificed. They had leaned on each other and on their parents as a crutch, had crippled themselves, and hadnt grown. They hadnt learned the hard part. They hadnt worried about making their marriage work. How do you support your wife? What is the role of a priesthood holder? What is the role of a woman with the priesthood? Again, its making sure that you share and grow together.</p>
<h2><b>Family Support in Church Callings</b></h2>
<p>My wife has taught me to grow in a number of ways, one of which Ill share with you for a moment. (Usually its a little easier to tell this story when shes not with me. Shes here today, and Im sure Ill be talked with afterwards.) After serving as an elders quorum president, a branch president, and a bishop over a period of five years, we moved to a new stake. The stake president recognized the great leadership talents of my wife. In fact, Ive spent most of my life being known as the husband of Mary Hales, but I dont mind that. My wife was asked to be a Relief Society president, which she has been twice in her life. (As Ive been a bishop three times, weve shared our priesthood and our Relief Society responsibilities.) She went to her first meeting with the bishop, a welfare meeting and a priesthood correlation meeting, while I chased two youngsters up and down the halls, through the parking lot, through the cultural hall, and had my first experience with waiting. I waited one and a half hours. When she came out, I had one boy in my arm and was holding the other by the hand. As the door opened and she came out of the bishops office, I had that look on my face. You know the look. I didnt have the courage to say anything, but I just gave her a look that said, "Do you realize youve kept me waiting an hour and a half?" All she did was raise five fingers and say, "Five years." That is how long she had been waiting for me. Then I began to realize it was going to be my job to support my wife in her calling just as she had supported me as a priesthood holder. There isnt a man here who cant learn from that story.</p>
<p>Ive heard of one husband who, on a Tuesday evening, was putting on his blue suit, his white shirt, and his blue tie. His wife asked him, "Where are you going?" His answer was very clear: "Im going to Relief Society. One of us has to go." That story would warm the heart of every Relief Society president in the world.</p>
<p>At the University of Utah, in an evening seminar, I was speaking to the M.B.A.s and senior business students. I noticed a young man with a baby sitting alone near the front of the hall. Afterwards he came up and spoke to me, still holding the baby. He had a few questions about his career. I said, "Where is your wife?" He said, "Well, when we were married, I promised her that she would have the opportunity of attending Relief Society. Tonight is Relief Society, and so I have our son at this seminar."</p>
<p>Every woman here should understand the importance of Relief Society in her marriage, and every priesthood holder should understand it.</p>
<p>I travel to stakes now, and I have learned that about one out of every five women, on average, goes to Relief Society. Sisters, start your habit of going to Relief Society at Brigham Young University. And brethren, you start your habit of supporting them in this activity. It is one of the most important chances theyll have for continuing education, for feeling self-worth, for being able to share testimonies in a testimony meeting.</p>
<p>There will be times when your wives will say to themselves that they wont be able to get through another day. There will be two or three children around the house, theyll be speaking on the level of a two- or three- or five-year-old, and at some point they will want to get out and have some cultural refinement. They will want to experience some growing. So it is that the testimony meeting helps your wives to share their feelings with each other. It also helps those of you women who will be alone, who may not have a partner. You should go to Relief Society for the association you will find there. It will help every woman in the Church to grow, to have new experiences. Someday you will go to Relief Society and hear someone bear her testimony; it will make you feel as though life is worth it.</p>
<p>There are two major reasons why women dont go to Relief Society. First, women do not know how important it is to them individually for their growth, or they dont know how important it is for their families and for their companionship with their husbands. Second, some priesthood holders do not support their wives and do not understand why it is important for them.</p>
<p>May I give just one last suggestion. When your companion is gone to Relief Society and youre all alone, youll have some of the best "memory moments" with your children. Thats also the time, maybe, to do a few dishes and to clean up the house a little bit, so that when she returns home she doesnt feel as though she has the weight of the world on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Many men feel that the physical part of their relationship in marriage is the most important part. But I want to tell each and everyone of you, very personally, that to clean a few dishes, vacuum a room, and have all of the kids in bed when mom comes home has got to be one of the most rewarding experiences your wife will ever have in marriage. Its a much better way, at times, of expressing your feelings than saying, "I love you."</p>
<p>You two also have to ask, as you travel through life in your marriage, "What are the anticipated problems if we dont follow the counsel which weve talked of today? What can we expect if we disregard the counsel of the Brethren, of the President of the Church, and of those who will counsel us on a temple marriage?" Thinking seriously about the answers to those questions may inspire us to do what is right.</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to give you my testimony. How I realize the importance of setting your course, of knowing where you are going. I ask the Lords blessings to be with you so that you will not lean on one another as a crutch, but youll both stand strong. Strengthen each other. Ask for help as you pray each night. Please date extensively. Please know the kind of person you want to be with. Please make sure that you help those you come in contact with. Please point them in the direction of associating with many people.</p>
<p>And please make sure that none of you sets an artificial goal for those you are going to marry. If you say, "Ill go with you or marry you if you go on a mission, or if youll marry in the temple," and if that isnt what they feel inside they want to do, fifteen or twenty years from now you may have a tragic circumstance. Make sure that you know before you get married what that person really wants to be inside. You can do that by seeing if he goes to his meetings and has a testimony and can talk to you about eternal goals, now.</p>
<p>I ask the Lords blessings to be with you. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I bear testimony to you that those moments in my life when I have been unhappy, depressed, or sad are when I have deviated, even in a minor degree, from the teachings of the Lord. That you might have true happiness and find the joy of a celestial marriage with a little heaven on earth is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It may not surprise you, but I want to declare at the outset that I have been multiply blessed. I want to initially mention an important blessing - this university - and then I would like to dwell on a forty-one-year blessing - my marriage. Those who have received this award in past years have stood here to express their gratitude to BYU, but I feel especially blessed in receiving this award as a non-Mormon. This university has insisted on valuing me regardless of my religious minority status. I am a religious "other," yet this university has not only accepted me as a colleague and a friend but also persisted in recognizing me and celebrating my work. I think this is a sort of minor miracle. As you will see in the case of my wife, I honestly believe that when we truly value and even love those who are "other" in some way, God is there.1
I also want to acknowledge how important this university has been to my academic work. I have long desired to actively interface the sacred and the secular - the sacredness of my faith and the secularity of my discipline of psychology - but there are few places that permit this work. BYU, however, has not only welcomed this type of scholarship but also encouraged and facilitated it. For this reason, I have never had to compartmentalize my Christianity away from my discipline; I have been able to integrate the two - which has been an incredible blessing to me!
As I mentioned, however, the blessing I want to dwell on today is the love I feel for my wife. But discussing such a personal experience may seem a bit strange for a psychologist. Psychologists are supposed to deal with objective data.2 Unfortunately, love isnt objective, so psychologys knowledge of love has been meager over the years. Consider renowned love researcher Harry Harlow and his lament in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association:
So far as love or affection is concerned, psychologists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple observation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.3
This conclusion was stated many years ago, but it is not unusual for even modern investigators of love to echo Harlows lament. Zick Rubin, for example, believes that some progress has been made, but he comments that love has "seemed safely beyond the research scientists ever-extending grasp."4
I wont get into psychological methods here. Suffice it to say that a relatively new brand of psychological method - qualitative investigation - was specifically set up to study subjective experiences. And qualitative investigators are not afraid of even just one persons experiences, especially when those personal experiences teach us something about the phenomenon of interest.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, President Worthen, for your gracious introduction. Wendy and I are grateful for the privilege of being here on this significant occasion. I bring love and greetings from President Thomas S. Monson, President Henry B. Eyring, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, my beloved Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and members of the board of trustees.
We are grateful for President Kevin J Worthen and President Cecil O. Samuelson, who have presided over the studies of this graduating class. We thank the faculty and staff for their service and tireless striving for excellence. And today we congratulate every graduate, along with their families and friends who have provided encouragement along the way. We are very proud of each of you!
Some of you will continue your education and achieve graduate degrees. Some of you will enter the workforce on a full-time basis. Many of you have married or will marry and begin your families. Family life will provide your most enduring rewards. As partners, you and your spouse will work together to achieve mutual goals and enjoy the fruits of your labors. By the way, brethren, you might bear this in mind: Behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in-law. I know mine was!
There is great power in a strong partnership. True partners can achieve more than the sum of each acting alone. With true partners, one plus one is much more than two. For example, Dr. Will Mayo and his brother, Dr. Charles Mayo, formed the Mayo Clinic. Lawyers and others form important partnerships. And in marriage, a husband and wife can form the most significant partnership of all - an eternal family.
Sustainable improvements in any endeavor depend on collaboration and agreement. Great leaders and partners develop the skill of sharing insights and efforts and the pattern of building consensus. Great partners are completely loyal. They suppress personal ego in exchange for being part of creating something larger than themselves. Great partnerships are dependent upon each individual developing his or her own personal attributes of character.
Each of us was born as an individual and is educated as an individual. You have passed tests to meet standards imposed upon you by someone else. You have been jumping over educational high hurdles, all erected by other people. For years you have been primarily task-oriented, preparing for what you want to do in life.
That is essential. But now it is time for a significant shift. Now it is time for you to define your own goals and meet your own expectations. From now on, you decide! Instead of concentrating on what you are to do, now is the time to zero in on who you are to be - on that person you are yet to become, as President Worthen explained so well. Now is the time for you to focus on developing great attributes of character.
Now seems to be my time for attending funerals. I have witnessed many families saying g</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have prayerfully prepared a message designed to bring you peace and happiness in a troubled world. I know that the truths it contains provide solutions because my precious wife, Jeanene, and I have proven their worth in our own lives.
For you to obtain the maximum benefit from our time together, I suggest that you carefully write down any impressions that come to you. They are personalized messages from the Lord sent through the Holy Ghost for your guidance.
Temple Ordinances Strengthen the Family and the Home
Two of the vital pillars that sustain Father in Heavens plan of happiness are the family and the home. Their lofty significance is underscored by Satans relentless efforts to splinter the family and to undermine the significance of temple ordinances, which bind the family together for eternity. He does this by constant encouragement to promote promiscuity and to defile the sacred, intimate expression of love between a husband and wife that results in the birth of children.
Fifty-seven years ago, on July 16, 1953, my beloved Jeanene and I knelt as a young couple at an altar in the Manti Utah Temple. President Lewis R. Anderson exercised the sealing authority and pronounced us husband and wife, wedded for time and for all eternity. I have no power to describe the peace and serenity that come from the assurance that, as I continue to live to qualify, I will be able to be with my beloved Jeanene and our obedient children forever because of that sacred ordinance performed with the proper priesthood authority in a house of the Lord.
Our seven children are bound to us by the sacred ordinances of the temple. My precious wife, Jeanene, and two of our children are beyond the veil. They provide a powerful motivation for each remaining member of our family to live so that together we can receive all of the eternal blessings promised in the temple.
The sealing in the temple has greater meaning as life unfolds and you discover the beauty of the differing characteristics between you, your spouse, and your children. You can share your love for each other and your gratitude for the blessing of being together. You can draw ever closer together and find greater fulfillment in mortality.
When my wife was carrying our third child, our second child was severely ill. Jeanene would hold him on her lap while they did fluoroscopic examinations. She received excessive radiation, and as a result she was unable to have additional children, and the one that she was carrying passed away prematurely. But we have them. They were born to us in the covenant. That is the blessing of the ordinances of the temple. Even though this mortal probation was for different lengths, those who were sealed to us with the holy priesthood through the ordinances of the holy temple will be ours for forever.
I know that I will have the privilege of being with that beautiful wife, whom I love with all my heart, and wit</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When couples get married, their love is deep, and they joyfully anticipate the prospect of spending the eternities together. They enjoy having endless talks, going for long walks, and spending time together. It is a wonderful feeling being with someone you love so deeply.
Unfortunately, for many couples the bliss of deep love and immensely satisfying companionship that was present when they first got married doesnt last. Long talks become replaced with frequent arguments, and when not spent fighting, their time together is characterized by angry silence.
Many of these couples divorce. Others manage the hostility by emotionally withdrawing from the relationship. The spouses become distant from each other, and they keep their interaction to a minimum. President Spencer W. Kimball described these couples when he said:
There are many people who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end their marriages, but who have permitted their marriage to grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouses who . . . are in the low state of mere joint occupancy of the home. [In Marriage (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 4446; adapted from Kimball, "Marriage and Divorce," BYU devotional address, 7 September 1976]
How do these couples go from ecstatic levels of love and happiness to frequent conflict, bitterness, and, in many cases, eventual divorce?
A number of reasons have been identified by researchers, but lately Ive been thinking that most of these reasons can be boiled down to two fundamental factors: a lack of repentance and a lack of forgiveness.
It is important to note that these principles of repentance and forgiveness apply to all relationships, not just to marriage. They apply to roommates, family members, and colleagues at work. So, no matter what ones marital status is or what the prospects in the near future are, these principles are important to all of us.
In most cases we are married for only a short time before we hurt our spouses feelings. Whether it is intentional, based on selfishness, or just inadvertent mistakes, we all end up doing things that create hurt in our spouse.
The remedy is pretty straightforward. We say, "Im sorry." We feel badly that we hurt our spouse, apologize, learn from the experience, and do our best not to make the same mistake again. We repent, and, assuming that the problem wasnt too major, the issue is over.
Elder Joe J. Christensen said:
To develop a solid marriage, we must be able to admit we are sorry for the mistakes we make. . . . When conflicts in marriage arise, we should be swift to apologize and ask for forgiveness, even though we may not be totally at fault. True love is developed by those who are willing to readily admit personal mistakes and offenses. [One Step a</span>
