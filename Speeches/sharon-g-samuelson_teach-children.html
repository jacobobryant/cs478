  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="We are grateful to be with you as we begin a new fall semester together. We hope that the summer has been as good for you as it has been for us.

The year 2008 has been very special for our family. Since the end of April we have added four new grandchildren, who, frankly, have been the focus of our thoughts and prayers. While absolutely wonderful in the broad sense, we have had a few challenges and concerns that accompany the perilous adventure of our mortal experiences.

Although I will share a little about our situation, I want to emphasize what a great blessing it has been for us to have these four little ones born into the families of three of our children. Our situation is not unlike many of yours: A few of you might already know - and a few of you will yet learn - that children dont always come when you put in the order. Often there is significant disappointment, frustration, and even grief. We have been very fortunate, but we recognize that there are many, including some in our own community, who have not and will not have the blessing of children in this life.

Happily, the scriptures and prophets have promised that if we do our very best in keeping our covenants and the commandments, all of the blessings Heavenly Father has promised His children will be made available to us eventually, including intact families, even if they are not experienced in this life.

In late April, twins were born to our elder daughter, Becki, and her husband, David. This was a special blessing, because these two went through their entire BYU experience unable to have children. Finally, with some special help, they had a beautiful little girl born 18 months before the birth of their twins. These two little ones were so anxious to begin their mortal sojourn that they arrived at 30 weeks. These precious premature babies spent a couple of months in the newborn intensive care unit of their local hospital, and after a number of slightly frightening adventures are now home and doing well.

The births of the other two grandchildren were less eventful in terms of timing and challenges, but all are loved by their parents, older siblings, and especially their grandparents! I mention these personal accounts because they have provoked not only tender feelings of love and gratitude but also concerns, prayers, and considerations about our grandchildrens lives and particularly about our responsibilities to them.

We pray that at some point in the not-too-distant future all of you will experience the joy and growth that come from being parents and that eventually you will also have the tremendous blessings we now enjoy as grandparents. In that spirit I would like to share with you some of my reflections with the hope and faith that they will be of some benefit to you as you think about your exciting futures.

First, I am now able to bear a strong testimony that children, in fact, "are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalm 127:3; see also "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1995, 102). What is meant by "an heritage"? It is something that comes as the result of inheritance or especially a unique gift, tradition, or responsibility. Since we understand that we are all, including our biological babies and children, spiritual progeny of our Heavenly Father, we also must understand that He shares in the responsibility to love, nurture, teach, protect, and encourage His own most precious possessions: His literal spirit children.

Thus, while we commonly think of children born or adopted into our families as our own, we need to consider carefully this fundamental truth: We are really agents of God the Father in providing these precious little ones the very best mortal experiences possible. This means, of course, that there is much more to our parenting responsibility than feeding, clothing, and making sure that proper dental and medical care are provided. And while music, dance, athletic, and other lessons and experiences are desirable in moderation - and when possible and practical - there is still much more that is expected and required.

Let me share some of these needs of our little ones and the resultant responsibilities of parents that deserve our very best attention. All might be found under the heading "Teach the Children."

In the first chapter of the book of Mosiah, we find an account of the parenting efforts of King Benjamin with his three sons. Let me share part of it with you as I focus on verses 2 through 7:

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 1:27]

I believe this is a wonderful summary of what we as parents, grandparents, and teachers of children and young people need to do. As I conclude, let me refer again to six parenting guidelines from King Benjamin.

First, he saw that his children were properly educated in language, reading, and the world around them.

Second, he saw that his sons were taught about the prophecies and teachings of the prophets of God.

Third, he not only taught these youngsters from the scriptures but also taught them about the scriptures and why they are vital and necessary for everyone.

Fourth, he not only consciously and thoroughly taught them about these truths but also had confidence that they, in turn, would be able to teach their children - his grandchildren - the same truths.

Fifth, he bore strong, direct, and specific testimony of the truthfulness of the things he taught them.

And sixth, he taught them the importance of keeping the commandments of God so that they might receive the special blessings Heavenly Father had in store for them.

I believe this is a wonderful and applicable pattern for all of us to follow as we prepare to teach our children, whether we have them now or whether that remarkable blessing and responsibility comes to us in the future.

I have a testimony that assisting our Father in Heaven in teaching children to love and serve the Lord is one of the most important blessings and responsibilities He has given us. The Savior loved and taught the little children, and we are to follow His example. The adversary recognizes the power in good families and is attacking them. I am confident that each of you, whether a parent at this point or not, can and must teach your children, your siblings, and other children with whom you have contact to walk uprightly before the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>We are grateful to be with you as we begin a new fall semester together. We hope that the summer has been as good for you as it has been for us.</p>
<p>The year 2008 has been very special for our family. Since the end of April we have added four new grandchildren, who, frankly, have been the focus of our thoughts and prayers. While absolutely wonderful in the broad sense, we have had a few challenges and concerns that accompany the perilous adventure of our mortal experiences.</p>
<p>Although I will share a little about our situation, I want to emphasize what a great blessing it has been for us to have these four little ones born into the families of three of our children. Our situation is not unlike many of yours: A few of you might already know - and a few of you will yet learn - that children dont always come when you put in the order. Often there is significant disappointment, frustration, and even grief. We have been very fortunate, but we recognize that there are many, including some in our own community, who have not and will not have the blessing of children in this life.</p>
<p>Happily, the scriptures and prophets have promised that if we do our very best in keeping our covenants and the commandments, all of the blessings Heavenly Father has promised His children will be made available to us eventually, including intact families, even if they are not experienced in this life.</p>
<p>In late April, twins were born to our elder daughter, Becki, and her husband, David. This was a special blessing, because these two went through their entire BYU experience unable to have children. Finally, with some special help, they had a beautiful little girl born 18 months before the birth of their twins. These two little ones were so anxious to begin their mortal sojourn that they arrived at 30 weeks. These precious premature babies spent a couple of months in the newborn intensive care unit of their local hospital, and after a number of slightly frightening adventures are now home and doing well.</p>
<p>The births of the other two grandchildren were less eventful in terms of timing and challenges, but all are loved by their parents, older siblings, and especially their grandparents! I mention these personal accounts because they have provoked not only tender feelings of love and gratitude but also concerns, prayers, and considerations about our grandchildrens lives and particularly about our responsibilities to them.</p>
<p>We pray that at some point in the not-too-distant future all of you will experience the joy and growth that come from being parents and that eventually you will also have the tremendous blessings we now enjoy as grandparents. In that spirit I would like to share with you some of my reflections with the hope and faith that they will be of some benefit to you as you think about your exciting futures.</p>
<p>First, I am now able to bear a strong testimony that children, in fact, "are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalm 127:3; see also "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102). What is meant by "an heritage"? It is something that comes as the result of inheritance or especially a unique gift, tradition, or responsibility. Since we understand that we are all, including our biological babies and children, spiritual progeny of our Heavenly Father, we also must understand that He shares in the responsibility to love, nurture, teach, protect, and encourage His own most precious possessions: His literal spirit children.</p>
<p>Thus, while we commonly think of children born or adopted into our families as our own, we need to consider carefully this fundamental truth: We are really agents of God the Father in providing these precious little ones the very best mortal experiences possible. This means, of course, that there is much more to our parenting responsibility than feeding, clothing, and making sure that proper dental and medical care are provided. And while music, dance, athletic, and other lessons and experiences are desirable in moderation - and when possible and practical - there is still much more that is expected and required.</p>
<p>Let me share some of these needs of our little ones and the resultant responsibilities of parents that deserve our very best attention. All might be found under the heading "Teach the Children."</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the book of Mosiah, we find an account of the parenting efforts of King Benjamin with his three sons. Let me share part of it with you as I focus on verses 2 through 7:</p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</i></p>
<p><i>For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</i></p>
<p><i>I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</i></p>
<p><i>And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</i> [Mosiah 1:27]</p>
<p>I believe this is a wonderful summary of what we as parents, grandparents, and teachers of children and young people need to do. As I conclude, let me refer again to six parenting guidelines from King Benjamin.</p>
<p>First, he saw that his children were properly educated in language, reading, and the world around them.</p>
<p>Second, he saw that his sons were taught about the prophecies and teachings of the prophets of God.</p>
<p>Third, he not only taught these youngsters from the scriptures but also taught them about the scriptures and why they are vital and necessary for everyone.</p>
<p>Fourth, he not only consciously and thoroughly taught them about these truths but also had confidence that they, in turn, would be able to teach their children - his grandchildren - the same truths.</p>
<p>Fifth, he bore strong, direct, and specific testimony of the truthfulness of the things he taught them.</p>
<p>And sixth, he taught them the importance of keeping the commandments of God so that they might receive the special blessings Heavenly Father had in store for them.</p>
<p>I believe this is a wonderful and applicable pattern for all of us to follow as we prepare to teach our children, whether we have them now or whether that remarkable blessing and responsibility comes to us in the future.</p>
<p>I have a testimony that assisting our Father in Heaven in teaching children to love and serve the Lord is one of the most important blessings and responsibilities He has given us. The Savior loved and taught the little children, and we are to follow His example. The adversary recognizes the power in good families and is attacking them. I am confident that each of you, whether a parent at this point or not, can and must teach your children, your siblings, and other children with whom you have contact to walk uprightly before the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">After receiving the call from President Worthen asking me to speak at devotional today, I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about what I might say.
One evening my daughter Andrea, who is a recent graduate of BYU, said, "Dad, dont worry. I always went to devotional to feel the Spirit and to have a rest from the stress of a week of school. As long as you bring the Spirit, it will be okay."
My prayer since then has been for the Spirit to attend us here today and to teach us all something new.
I would like to start with a favorite scripture. In 1 Nephi the young Nephi desired to see the same things that his father, Lehi, saw in a vision. An angel came and showed him what Lehi saw - and even more - and asked him, "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" (1 Nephi 11:16).
Nephi replied, "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17).
I remember reading the Book of Mormon as a boy and coming to these verses and thinking, "I dont even know what that word - condescension - means! But wow, I love Nephis answer! He knew that his Heavenly Father loved him, and that was what mattered most to him."
I have spent years pondering this declaration of Nephis. It tells me who I am: I am a child of a loving Father in Heaven. Many in the world today deny the divinity of man. They claim that we are merely the victors in a biological race for superiority of the species on this planet. But I testify that, through holy prophets, God has revealed that as we are His children, there is a purpose to our lives. We should all rejoice in this knowledge that we have. But we should realize that not all people have it.
After arriving in the mission field many years ago, one of the first things I learned was that most of the people in Taiwan with whom I came into contact had no concept of God as their Father in Heaven. I realized that I, however, had always just taken that knowledge for granted. Back then the discussions were memorized and were designated by letters of the alphabet. My favorite discussion quickly became the D discussion, the plan of salvation. I loved it mainly because it allowed us to teach this most fundamental truth - that of our relationship to a loving Heavenly Father. I saw this truth change the lives of the Taiwan Saints. Once they learned it, they were changed people; they radiated a love for their Heavenly Father.
In contrast, a few years ago we had a graduate student in our department who exhibited the opposite. Having been raised in a communist and atheistic country, he had no knowledge of what we are talking about here today. At one point in his studies he had a series of setbacks. From these he concluded that "fate" had turned against him. He felt powerless and not in control of his own destiny. He concluded he was not meant to complete his degree and decided to leave our graduate progra</span>

So, in conclusion, I love Christmas and I love BYU devotionals. I am grateful to be with you, and my older siblings, graduates of BYU, are here, having traveled from Arizona and Idaho. They must have thought I was graduating today. Im not saying my older siblings are old, but there were no history classes on campus when they attended, just current events. The deodorant Old Spice was then known as New Spice, and the Dead Sea was just mildly sick.
Since my academic focus is education law, and since much of that discipline and practice is focused on protecting the rights and persons of children, Id like to discuss what it means in the perfect economy of the Lords kingdom to become as a little child. I believe Christmas and the birth of the Christ child help us explore this concept.
Becoming as a Little Child
When our Heavenly Father wanted to save the world, He didnt take over a country or develop a militia. He sent a helpless child to a choice and worthy woman and a humble and believing man living in insecure circumstances in a conquered land occupied by a hostile force. The harsh geopolitical and military circumstances of Christs birth should remind us that Heavenly Father can bless us even if the external circumstances of our lives arent necessarily easy or peaceful.
Herod the Great ruled over that land, under Romes ultimate control. He was mighty and built magnificent monuments - at least one of which overshadowed the land when Christ was born, being visible in all directions for miles. We cant help but contrast Herods mighty palace with the stable. If we knew for sure where the stable was, wouldnt we wish to visit the site of that sacred birth? But who cares as much about anything Herod built, besides perhaps one or two of our learned faculty members? Most of us with a normal threshold for boredom ignore Herod.
Christ is infinitely more important. We seek Christs words and probably have many of His words memorized. Well, not everyone does apparently, because Im always surprised on Jeopardy when those brainiacs often seem to know nothing about the scriptures. We Mormons, in turn, are continually lost on the "Potent Potables" category. We celebrate and rejoice in the words and the happenings of Christs birth. Does anyone, even the most bookishly versant among us, celebrate the words or circumstances of Herod and his birth?
The New Testament shows us something of the Christ child we celebrate at Christmas in the perfect young adult He has become. He hasnt become full of Himself and self-important, careworn, and brusque. Although Isaiah described Him as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted wi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">While preparing for this devotional address, I felt prompted to speak about becoming as little children, like the Sunbeam children I have taught in Primary for so many years. I have a very dear place in my heart for these young children who are beginning to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. I could share with you many amusing stories about them that show how their understanding is just emerging.
Trevor, for example, once sang, "I am a child of God, and he has sent me beer!" And Kevin, in every prayer he offered, prayed that Spiderman would demolish the Green Goblin - only to be interrupted each time by Anna, who would respond with a big sigh and say, "Oh, no! Not again!"
However, there are serious messages we can learn from children today - lessons that can teach us how to "walk as children of light" (Ephesians 5:8).
My love for teaching young children prompted me to search for information about Sunbeams and the beloved childrens hymn "Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam" (Songbook, 6061). I learned that the song was written by Nellie Talbot in 1899:
Racking her brain for material for her Sunday School class in rural Missouri, she thought to herself, "How can you say theres nothing to teach about when you have the sun and the sky and the trees and the flowers!" [www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/i/l/l/illbeasb.htm]
Edwin Othello Excell, composer of "Count Your Blessings" (Hymns, 1985, no. 241) and the predominant arranger of "Amazing Grace," wrote the music to the Sunbeam song, which was originally entitled "Ill Be a Sunbeam."
As I continued my search for the history of the Sunbeam song, I discovered that it had a connection to the first Sunbeam Band, an organization for the Christian training of young children (see Encyclopedia of Southern Baptists [Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman Press, 1958], s.v. "Sunbeam Band," 2:1314). The Sunbeam Band was formed in 1886, when Anna Louise Elsom, a young mother who taught children ages four to 13 at Fairmont Baptist Church in Nelson County, Virginia, "prayed that God would send someone to help her teach the boys and girls about missions" (www.vaiden.net/baptist.html). Soon George Braxton Taylor, a young pastor "with a heart all aglow with a fire for missions, came right from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville to become the new pastor for the Fairmont Baptist Church" (ibid.). It was this young pastor who organized the first Sunbeam Band.
His name, George Braxton Taylor, jumped out at me. I thought to myself, "That name sounds familiar. I wonder if we are related." So I went to the Taylor family tree that my father had compiled and found several George Taylors listed - which obviously meant it is a common name in my family. Upon viewing this chart more closely, I found that indeed there was a George Braxton Taylor who was born and lived in Virginia at about the s</span>

And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. . . .
. . . It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. [Matthew 18:15, 14]
The resurrected Savior also showed his great love for little children when He ministered to the Nephites:
He took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them. . . .
And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.
And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them. [3 Nephi 17:21, 2324]
And here is what our current prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, has said about children:
Parents have not just a responsibility but a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God, and to be law-abiding citizens where they live. . . .
. . . If our children are really our greatest treasures, it stands to reason that they deserve our greatest attention. . . .
Children are of far greater value than any kind of material wealth. [Standing for Something (New York: Times Books, 2000), 146, 15253]
We could fill this devotional hour with counsel from our Church leaders on our responsibilities toward the children in our lives. The messages in the scriptures and from modern-day prophets are consistent and clear. Children are to be highly valued and taught and protected. And, interestingly enough, in turn we need to develop some of their characteristics to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I have had the opportunity of spending many hours in the company of children in both school and church settings. It is a blessing to be in their company. I learned early in my teaching career the value of writing down what I was learning from my young students. They can be great teachers.
Today I will share a few experiences that illustrate lessons we can and cannot learn from children and also what caring adults need to do to provide a lifeline for children who are born into challenging families.
Lets start with the lessons children do not </span>
