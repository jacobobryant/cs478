  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My wife and I once boarded a train going south from Paris to Marseilles, a Mediterranean port. At Lyon, about halfway there, part of the train (the part we were in!) split off and headed east toward Geneva. As soon as we saw the Alps, we realized that we were off course. We got off in Grenoble, caught a train back to Lyon, then took a later train to Marseilles. Our minimal ability to discern between the Alps and the Mediterranean helped us to make a necessary course correction on a physical journey.

We need discernment for each of the three tracks of our journey through life. These tracks can be symbolized by places: Babylon for material life, Athens for intellectual life, and Zion for spiritual life. Scriptural imagery distinguishes Babylon from Sodom, an emblem of gross perversions. Babylon represents our entire material experience - meeting our physical needs, "getting and spending,"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; relishing "the vain things of the world,"&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and satisfying "the natural man."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; According to a "double commandment," we are instructed both to be "not of the world" and to be "in the world."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Peter, advising the Saints to "be ye holy," did so "at Babylon"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; - that is, in the world. This is a main purpose of our "second estate": to be proven while we dwell on the earth.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Claims of bravery mean nothing in the absence of danger. Likewise, innocence shielded by nonopportunity is not the same thing as virtue that is freely chosen among alternatives and then severely tested in the furnace of life. So we are charged to pass our mortal probation not isolated in monastic enclaves but thoroughly engaged in human society.

Babylon thus comprises our material circumstances, our physical movements, our social environments, and even our professional careers. In traveling through Babylon it is important to increase our powers of discernment by using them - just as we strengthen our muscles through physical exercise. Discerning our journey through the world entails, first, choosing specific worthy destinations rather than just drifting somewhere. Floating with natural currents usually takes us downstream to Babylons Sodom-like districts. To avoid these in favor of better neighborhoods, we seek positive objectives and make frequent course corrections in order to reach them.

At times as we exercise discernment, we may even need to change our destinations. In fall 2000 we were shepherding BYU students in the Holy Land. They were visiting Akko for a couple of hours en route to Jerusalem. But Jerusalem suddenly experienced a spike of unrest, so we changed their destination to the safer area of Galilee.

Likewise, discerning the road ahead may require us to modify our professional goals. I grew up as the son of a metalworker in an LDS ward with about 20 dentists. They taught me to visualize sin as a cavity! At any rate, in my midteens I decided to be a dentist. That was my vocational ambition until I encountered a dose of reality called organic chemistry! I then prudently changed my career path.

Among the most noteworthy physical journeys were those of Lehi and Brigham Young. Their examples show us that although travelers meet obstacles and get sidetracked, resolute ones persevere until they reach their destinations.

Ive had some experience with obstacles and sidetracks. After teaching at the University of Miami for a year, I received in fall 1973 a postdoctoral grant to do research in Yemen. My ticket, paid for by the grant, took me from Miami to New York to Paris to Tunis and then (the plan was) to Cairo and Yemen. Because we had to pay for their travel ourselves, my wife and three small children took a cheapie airline to Luxembourg, rode trains for three days to Istanbul, then got on a plane to Beirut, whence they were to fly to meet me at the Cairo airport so we could proceed to Yemen together.

No one told us that a war would break out between Egypt and Israel a few hours before our scheduled reunion. My wife missed her plane from Beirut - luckily, because it came under fire. My plane was grounded in Libya, where I was put under arrest for three days and then sent back to Tunis. It took me nearly a week to discover that my family was stranded in Lebanon. They came to Tunis, where my research grant had been reassigned by U.S. officials - who changed their minds, however, and told us to proceed to Yemen. We went first to Rome. Our flight from Rome to Jidda in western Arabia was diverted around the war zone to eastern Arabia, where we were detained overnight and then deported to Bahrain. After a month of such obstacles and sidetracks, we finally arrived in Yemen, where we discovered a magical society in which I conducted my research and my wife taught at a Yemeni school. After leaving Yemen we finally did go to Cairo, where we spent the next 11 years.

Whereas Babylon stands for worldly matters, Athens represents intellectual ones. To Latter-day Saints, however, Athens symbolizes a destination as well as a passage, for we know that intelligence is a basic part of our eternal nature and that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; So we should work to maximize our intellectual capacity and discernment not just for the purpose of navigating routes but also for that of magnifying our stewardships over our very selves. Moreover, the "greatest commandment" is to love the Lord with all our mind as well as with all our strength and soul.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; So we want to love Him - not with an empty, small, or flabby mind but with a mind as large, as vigorous, and as disciplined as we can possibly make it.

How do we strengthen our intellects and our powers of intellectual discernment? First, we make intelligent choices to avoid mental Sodoms - like pornography and drivel-spewing media that stupefy our minds instead of stimulating them. But we dont avoid the big ideas and the hard questions, which we are, in effect, mandated to engage. BYUs mission statement reminds us that "a broad university education . . . will help students think clearly [and] understand important ideas,"&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and the civilization course guidelines urge "the exploration of some important questions and themes."

I remember a student telling me on the first day of a world civilization course: "Im going to be an accountant. I dont need to know anything about Shakespeare or Gandhi." Three months later he changed his mind. A young woman he home taught consented to date him because, after our class discussion on early 20th-century art, hed been able to explain the symbolism of her Marc Chagall print.

But general education courses can do more than improve our social lives. They can stretch and sharpen our intellects to make us better citizens of our country and more effective servants of God. In that regard, some of the thorns and thistles&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; prescribed for Adams posterity may include thorny ideas; when we sweat over them, we broaden and sharpen our minds. After all, athletes improve their performance by facing better competition; businesses become more efficient and make finer products by participating in competitive markets; and our intelligence grows in quantity and quality by wrestling with challenging ideas. That principle, I believe, is implicit both in the Lords teaching to Abraham about mortalitys purpose&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and in Lehis profound statement about "opposition in all things."&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Besides, intellectual discovery is an exhilarating experience, not just a mandate. I remember the exhilaration the first time I read in &lt;i&gt;The Prelude&lt;/i&gt; by Wordsworth a few verses that paraphrase Lehis statement about the importance of opposition:

&lt;i&gt;There is a dark&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Discordant elements, makes them cling together&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In one society. How strange, that all&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The terrors, pains, and early miseries,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Within my mind, should eer have borne a part,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And that a needful part, in making up&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The calm existence that is mine when I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Am worthy of myself!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter experienced such a discovery. He was struggling to define the concept that - in order to protect the innocent fully - courts of law should treat even the villainous fairly. He went to see Robert Bolts play &lt;i&gt;A Man for All Seasons,&lt;/i&gt; about Sir Thomas Mores interactions with the selfish tyrant King Henry VIII. At the point where Mores character spoke the line "Yes, Id give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safetys sake,"&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Justice Frankfurter blurted out, "Thats the point, . . . thats it!"&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

When I first saw that play, I thought "Thats it!" in two other scenes. In one, Sir Thomas learns of an oath crafted to entrap him by the kings henchmen; yet he hopes that the wording of the oath will let him take it without violating his conscience. He tells his daughter: "God . . . made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity. But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind!"&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; The other scene is set in the Tower of London, where More has been jailed for refusing to take the oath. His daughter urges him to say it with his mouth and to think otherwise in his heart; after all, she notes, he is a virtuous hero, and its not his fault the government is bad. Sir Thomas replies:

&lt;i&gt;If we lived in a State where virtue was profitable, common sense would make us good, and greed would make us saintly. . . . But since in fact we see that&lt;/i&gt; [villainies] &lt;i&gt;commonly profit far beyond&lt;/i&gt; [virtues]&lt;i&gt;, and have to choose, . . . why then perhaps we&lt;/i&gt; must &lt;i&gt;stand fast a little.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;

So we seek Athens keenly and do not fear it - unlike the slothful servant who, being "afraid,"&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; buried his talent &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his future. Most Latter-day Saints who lose their way do so in Babylons hedonistic arcades, where, like Housmans ale-drinking "fellows whom it hurts to think," they "look into the pewter pot / To see the world as the worlds not."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Comparatively fewer get lost in Athens laboratories, lecture halls, and libraries. It is usually Babylons "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God"&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; who try to rationalize destructive self-gratification in half-baked intellectual terms, rehearsing cliche about freedom to justify enslaving vices. Indeed, as a rule, better education correlates with stronger commitment to gospel principles and with greater activity in the Church,&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; to which ignorance is the graver threat.

As by design does mortal life itself, the life of the mind does, of course, have pitfalls. President Hugh B. Brown told BYU students 36 years ago, "One cannot think right without running the risk of thinking wrong." Just as we endure setbacks when we take bad turns along roads through the world, we suffer negative consequences for our immature or misinformed intellectual conclusions. But, as President Brown went on to say, "Generally more thinking is the antidote for the evils that spring from wrong thinking."&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

"More thinking" should not entail just parroting our brightest, most articulate fellow humans, past or present. Concerning the greatest truths, theyve all speculated wrong on some vital points, leading astray any uncritical disciples whose quest takes them no farther than saying "me too." Wordsworth, for example, venerated "meadow, grove, and stream"&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; to the extent of pantheism. While appreciating his insight about reconciling discordant elements, we would not follow him in substituting the worship of abstract nature for the worship of our personal Father.

Hugh Nibley was an advisor for my master of arts thesis. Once, when I was in his office to get feedback on a draft chapter, his phone rang. He picked it up, listened for a while, then, before hanging up, said, "You ought to do your own research." Refusing to "set [himself] up for a light unto the world,"&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; he fended off would-be "Nibley groupies." Rather, he urged his students not just to do their own research but also and especially to do their own critical thinking. To that end God made every intelligence "independent . . . to act for itself."&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

We can strengthen our intellectual discernment only by using it often. When I was in France on a mission 45 years ago, I learned a French proverb: &lt;i&gt;"Cest en forgeant quon devient forgeron"&lt;/i&gt; ("It is by smithing that one becomes a smith"). So it is by thinking discerningly that one becomes a discerning thinker.

Of course mature intellectual independence requires a long apprenticeship. From the word &lt;i&gt;sophomore - &lt;/i&gt;one who has completed a freshman year - comes the word &lt;i&gt;sophomoric:&lt;/i&gt; "overconfident of knowledge but poorly informed and immature."&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; We are sophomoric when we consider ourselves wise on the basis of a little learning&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; - what Santayana called "a torch of smoky pine / That lights the pathway but one step ahead" or what Paul likened to seeing "through a glass, darkly."&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, "the learned" are apt to become "puffed up in the pride of their hearts."&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; Such vanity is especially dangerous, according to C. S. Lewis and President Benson,&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; when it involves enmity for God. Conversely, "a wise man will hear, and will increase learning."&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; The wisest scholars learn early to forsake arrogant dogmatism and to embrace humility. Although working ultimately toward intellectual self-reliance, we need to stay mindful that our thought processes are still comparatively juvenile. We limit our intellectual potential when, with more zeal than knowledge,&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; as adolescents we embrace a worldly intellectual or political trend, demonize its alternatives, and devote ourselves, as Santayana put it, to "not covet truth, but victory and the dispelling of their own doubts."&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; With humility and open minds we should read the great thinkers - to exercise our brains and&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;to discover and refine nuggets of truth. As Paul advised, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;

The ideal of Zion represents the destination of our spiritual journey. For every difficulty of physical, professional, or intellectual traveling - drifting, obstacles, sidetracks, pitfalls, wrong conclusions, and sophomoric pride - there are spiritual equivalents with spiritual consequences. But the stakes are higher. I remember a time when our family was ordering pizza; my children debated whether to get pepperoni or another topping. The debate ended when one of them said, "Well, its not a life-or-death decision."

According to Alma, the choices we make on our lifes spiritual track, however, really are life-or-death decisions, with "joy" accompanying (spiritual) life and "remorse of conscience" accompanying (spiritual) death.&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; For precisely that reason, less than two months ago Elder Bednar taught us about spiritual discernment.&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; If you have "cut-and-paste" functions in your mind, insert what he said here. I add a few observations from my own experience.

Spiritual discernment helps us to perceive our own lapses and lacks. I have met persons whose pride or enmity for God blinded them to their sins and so to their very eternal predicament. To such was Samuel talking when he called "unto the Lord, . . . that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great."&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; As Paul put it, "There is none righteous. . . . For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"; so every human needs "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;

But I have met others whose keen awareness of their past and present failings - and of their inability to overcome these on their own - have in effect blinded them to the grace of the Atonement and to the miracles of repentance and forgiveness. Reasoning that "I am unworthy, so the Savior cant redeem me" constitutes a spiritual &lt;i&gt;non sequitur.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;

Beyond enabling us to recognize our foibles, spiritual discernment helps us to see and feel Gods goodness, love, and redemptive power. Like the abilities to discern the worlds best destinations and to intellectually discern nuggets of truth from speculation or sophistry, spiritual discernment becomes stronger and sharper through use. A doctor once showed me an X-ray and said, "You can plainly see the problem right here." But, having no experience reading X-rays, I could see nothing but fuzzy blurs. The doctor could read X-rays because he did so every day. By seeking the Light of Christ every day, we increase our capacity to discern good from evil by its illumination. By listening to the Holy Ghost every day, we learn to hear more clearly the "still small voice."&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;

Babylons happiness is attained, as Shakespeare put it, through attracting "Fortune and mens eyes."&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; Babylons hedonism is so pervasive and potent that many defer until the afterlife the possibility of Zions happiness - entailing personal and group righteousness and holiness. But the Lord clearly seeks to "establish Zion" among us here and now.&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; That begs the key question: How can we establish Zion while dwelling in Babylon? We can do it, in effect, by sanctifying the nooks and crannies of Babylon that are nearest to us - our own bodies and minds, our families and homes, our wards and neighborhoods.

We start with our personal core and proceed outward to whatever periphery our influence can reach. If we are blessed with wealth, we consecrate it to the Lord - who told Martin Harris not to covet his own property.&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; If we are blessed with learning, we devote it to strengthening Gods enterprises and His children - our brothers and sisters.&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; In that regard, so many scriptures pair worshipping God with serving our fellow beings that we must regard them as symbiotic, mutually necessary endeavors. We cant serve God effectively without serving each other effectively.

Some of my best experiences with the growth of spiritual discernment have come while serving at the BYU Jerusalem Center. Some students would arrive - fresh from Babylon - boasting of their thrilling amusements to get attention. But then they went to the hill east of Bethel to reflect on the covenant of Abraham, to Mount Sinai to contemplate that of Moses, and to Mount Ebal to think about Joshuas rededication. They visited Nazareth to see where Jesus "grew, and waxed strong in spirit."&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; They traveled into the Judean wilderness to consider the resolve with which He began His ministry, to Galilee to ponder His Sermon on the Mount and the principles of His higher law, to Mount Tabor to recall His Transfiguration, then back to Jerusalem to study His healing miracles. In a culminating journey they walked from Bethany over the Mount of Olives to Gethsemane, then across the Kidron Valley to the possible sites of Golgotha and the nearby tomb in a garden. That evening they reenacted the Last Supper.

By then I could feel that most students were forsaking Babylon and approaching Zion. As they recommitted themselves to serving God better, they simultaneously shifted their concerns from their own comforts and conceits to the welfare of their classmates and others within the reach of their positive influence. Such commitments each of us has made and remade many times - in premortal life, at baptism, in the temple, and every Sabbath when we partake of the sacramental emblems. I pray that we shall perform our next act of covenant renewal with greater resolve, confidence, and purpose.

I pray that we shall resolve to discern our way to worthy destinations in mortal life; that we shall resolve to strengthen our minds to appreciate with exhilaration our intellectual heritage, to understand our complex world more fully, and to love the Lord and serve His children more effectively; and that we shall resolve to consecrate and sanctify ourselves, our assets, and our environments. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>My wife and I once boarded a train going south from Paris to Marseilles, a Mediterranean port. At Lyon, about halfway there, part of the train (the part we were in!) split off and headed east toward Geneva. As soon as we saw the Alps, we realized that we were off course. We got off in Grenoble, caught a train back to Lyon, then took a later train to Marseilles. Our minimal ability to discern between the Alps and the Mediterranean helped us to make a necessary course correction on a physical journey.</p>
<p>We need discernment for each of the three tracks of our journey through life. These tracks can be symbolized by places: Babylon for material life, Athens for intellectual life, and Zion for spiritual life. Scriptural imagery distinguishes Babylon from Sodom, an emblem of gross perversions. Babylon represents our entire material experience - meeting our physical needs, "getting and spending,"<sup>1</sup> relishing "the vain things of the world,"<sup>2</sup> and satisfying "the natural man."<sup>3</sup> According to a "double commandment," we are instructed both to be "not of the world" and to be "in the world."<sup>4</sup> Peter, advising the Saints to "be ye holy," did so "at Babylon"<sup>5</sup> - that is, in the world. This is a main purpose of our "second estate": to be proven while we dwell on the earth.<sup>6</sup> Claims of bravery mean nothing in the absence of danger. Likewise, innocence shielded by nonopportunity is not the same thing as virtue that is freely chosen among alternatives and then severely tested in the furnace of life. So we are charged to pass our mortal probation not isolated in monastic enclaves but thoroughly engaged in human society.</p>
<p>Babylon thus comprises our material circumstances, our physical movements, our social environments, and even our professional careers. In traveling through Babylon it is important to increase our powers of discernment by using them - just as we strengthen our muscles through physical exercise. Discerning our journey through the world entails, first, choosing specific worthy destinations rather than just drifting somewhere. Floating with natural currents usually takes us downstream to Babylons Sodom-like districts. To avoid these in favor of better neighborhoods, we seek positive objectives and make frequent course corrections in order to reach them.</p>
<p>At times as we exercise discernment, we may even need to change our destinations. In fall 2000 we were shepherding BYU students in the Holy Land. They were visiting Akko for a couple of hours en route to Jerusalem. But Jerusalem suddenly experienced a spike of unrest, so we changed their destination to the safer area of Galilee.</p>
<p>Likewise, discerning the road ahead may require us to modify our professional goals. I grew up as the son of a metalworker in an LDS ward with about 20 dentists. They taught me to visualize sin as a cavity! At any rate, in my midteens I decided to be a dentist. That was my vocational ambition until I encountered a dose of reality called organic chemistry! I then prudently changed my career path.</p>
<p>Among the most noteworthy physical journeys were those of Lehi and Brigham Young. Their examples show us that although travelers meet obstacles and get sidetracked, resolute ones persevere until they reach their destinations.</p>
<p>Ive had some experience with obstacles and sidetracks. After teaching at the University of Miami for a year, I received in fall 1973 a postdoctoral grant to do research in Yemen. My ticket, paid for by the grant, took me from Miami to New York to Paris to Tunis and then (the plan was) to Cairo and Yemen. Because we had to pay for their travel ourselves, my wife and three small children took a cheapie airline to Luxembourg, rode trains for three days to Istanbul, then got on a plane to Beirut, whence they were to fly to meet me at the Cairo airport so we could proceed to Yemen together.</p>
<p>No one told us that a war would break out between Egypt and Israel a few hours before our scheduled reunion. My wife missed her plane from Beirut - luckily, because it came under fire. My plane was grounded in Libya, where I was put under arrest for three days and then sent back to Tunis. It took me nearly a week to discover that my family was stranded in Lebanon. They came to Tunis, where my research grant had been reassigned by U.S. officials - who changed their minds, however, and told us to proceed to Yemen. We went first to Rome. Our flight from Rome to Jidda in western Arabia was diverted around the war zone to eastern Arabia, where we were detained overnight and then deported to Bahrain. After a month of such obstacles and sidetracks, we finally arrived in Yemen, where we discovered a magical society in which I conducted my research and my wife taught at a Yemeni school. After leaving Yemen we finally did go to Cairo, where we spent the next 11 years.</p>
<p>Whereas Babylon stands for worldly matters, Athens represents intellectual ones. To Latter-day Saints, however, Athens symbolizes a destination as well as a passage, for we know that intelligence is a basic part of our eternal nature and that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."<sup>7</sup> So we should work to maximize our intellectual capacity and discernment not just for the purpose of navigating routes but also for that of magnifying our stewardships over our very selves. Moreover, the "greatest commandment" is to love the Lord with all our mind as well as with all our strength and soul.<sup>8</sup> So we want to love Him - not with an empty, small, or flabby mind but with a mind as large, as vigorous, and as disciplined as we can possibly make it.</p>
<p>How do we strengthen our intellects and our powers of intellectual discernment? First, we make intelligent choices to avoid mental Sodoms - like pornography and drivel-spewing media that stupefy our minds instead of stimulating them. But we dont avoid the big ideas and the hard questions, which we are, in effect, mandated to engage. BYUs mission statement reminds us that "a broad university education . . . will help students think clearly [and] understand important ideas,"<sup>9</sup> and the civilization course guidelines urge "the exploration of some important questions and themes."</p>
<p>I remember a student telling me on the first day of a world civilization course: "Im going to be an accountant. I dont need to know anything about Shakespeare or Gandhi." Three months later he changed his mind. A young woman he home taught consented to date him because, after our class discussion on early 20th-century art, hed been able to explain the symbolism of her Marc Chagall print.</p>
<p>But general education courses can do more than improve our social lives. They can stretch and sharpen our intellects to make us better citizens of our country and more effective servants of God. In that regard, some of the thorns and thistles<sup>10</sup> prescribed for Adams posterity may include thorny ideas; when we sweat over them, we broaden and sharpen our minds. After all, athletes improve their performance by facing better competition; businesses become more efficient and make finer products by participating in competitive markets; and our intelligence grows in quantity and quality by wrestling with challenging ideas. That principle, I believe, is implicit both in the Lords teaching to Abraham about mortalitys purpose<sup>11</sup> and in Lehis profound statement about "opposition in all things."<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Besides, intellectual discovery is an exhilarating experience, not just a mandate. I remember the exhilaration the first time I read in <i>The Prelude</i> by Wordsworth a few verses that paraphrase Lehis statement about the importance of opposition:</p>
<p><i>There is a dark</i><br />
<i>Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles</i><br />
<i>Discordant elements, makes them cling together</i><br />
<i>In one society. How strange, that all</i><br />
<i>The terrors, pains, and early miseries,</i><br />
<i>Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused</i><br />
<i>Within my mind, should eer have borne a part,</i><br />
<i>And that a needful part, in making up</i><br />
<i>The calm existence that is mine when I</i><br />
<i>Am worthy of myself!</i><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter experienced such a discovery. He was struggling to define the concept that - in order to protect the innocent fully - courts of law should treat even the villainous fairly. He went to see Robert Bolts play <i>A Man for All Seasons,</i> about Sir Thomas Mores interactions with the selfish tyrant King Henry VIII. At the point where Mores character spoke the line "Yes, Id give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safetys sake,"<sup>14</sup> Justice Frankfurter blurted out, "Thats the point, . . . thats it!"<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>When I first saw that play, I thought "Thats it!" in two other scenes. In one, Sir Thomas learns of an oath crafted to entrap him by the kings henchmen; yet he hopes that the wording of the oath will let him take it without violating his conscience. He tells his daughter: "God . . . made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity. But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind!"<sup>16</sup> The other scene is set in the Tower of London, where More has been jailed for refusing to take the oath. His daughter urges him to say it with his mouth and to think otherwise in his heart; after all, she notes, he is a virtuous hero, and its not his fault the government is bad. Sir Thomas replies:</p>
<p><i>If we lived in a State where virtue was profitable, common sense would make us good, and greed would make us saintly. . . . But since in fact we see that</i> [villainies] <i>commonly profit far beyond</i> [virtues]<i>, and have to choose, . . . why then perhaps we</i> must <i>stand fast a little.</i><sup>17</sup></p>
<p>So we seek Athens keenly and do not fear it - unlike the slothful servant who, being "afraid,"<sup>18</sup> buried his talent <i>and</i> his future. Most Latter-day Saints who lose their way do so in Babylons hedonistic arcades, where, like Housmans ale-drinking "fellows whom it hurts to think," they "look into the pewter pot / To see the world as the worlds not."<sup>19</sup> Comparatively fewer get lost in Athens laboratories, lecture halls, and libraries. It is usually Babylons "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God"<sup>20</sup> who try to rationalize destructive self-gratification in half-baked intellectual terms, rehearsing cliche about freedom to justify enslaving vices. Indeed, as a rule, better education correlates with stronger commitment to gospel principles and with greater activity in the Church,<sup>21</sup> to which ignorance is the graver threat.</p>
<p>As by design does mortal life itself, the life of the mind does, of course, have pitfalls. President Hugh B. Brown told BYU students 36 years ago, "One cannot think right without running the risk of thinking wrong." Just as we endure setbacks when we take bad turns along roads through the world, we suffer negative consequences for our immature or misinformed intellectual conclusions. But, as President Brown went on to say, "Generally more thinking is the antidote for the evils that spring from wrong thinking."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>"More thinking" should not entail just parroting our brightest, most articulate fellow humans, past or present. Concerning the greatest truths, theyve all speculated wrong on some vital points, leading astray any uncritical disciples whose quest takes them no farther than saying "me too." Wordsworth, for example, venerated "meadow, grove, and stream"<sup>23</sup> to the extent of pantheism. While appreciating his insight about reconciling discordant elements, we would not follow him in substituting the worship of abstract nature for the worship of our personal Father.</p>
<p>Hugh Nibley was an advisor for my master of arts thesis. Once, when I was in his office to get feedback on a draft chapter, his phone rang. He picked it up, listened for a while, then, before hanging up, said, "You ought to do your own research." Refusing to "set [himself] up for a light unto the world,"<sup>24</sup> he fended off would-be "Nibley groupies." Rather, he urged his students not just to do their own research but also and especially to do their own critical thinking. To that end God made every intelligence "independent . . . to act for itself."<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>We can strengthen our intellectual discernment only by using it often. When I was in France on a mission 45 years ago, I learned a French proverb: <i>"Cest en forgeant quon devient forgeron"</i> ("It is by smithing that one becomes a smith"). So it is by thinking discerningly that one becomes a discerning thinker.</p>
<p>Of course mature intellectual independence requires a long apprenticeship. From the word <i>sophomore - </i>one who has completed a freshman year - comes the word <i>sophomoric:</i> "overconfident of knowledge but poorly informed and immature."<sup>26</sup> We are sophomoric when we consider ourselves wise on the basis of a little learning<sup>27</sup> - what Santayana called "a torch of smoky pine / That lights the pathway but one step ahead" or what Paul likened to seeing "through a glass, darkly."<sup>28</sup> Indeed, "the learned" are apt to become "puffed up in the pride of their hearts."<sup>29</sup> Such vanity is especially dangerous, according to C. S. Lewis and President Benson,<sup>30</sup> when it involves enmity for God. Conversely, "a wise man will hear, and will increase learning."<sup>31</sup> The wisest scholars learn early to forsake arrogant dogmatism and to embrace humility. Although working ultimately toward intellectual self-reliance, we need to stay mindful that our thought processes are still comparatively juvenile. We limit our intellectual potential when, with more zeal than knowledge,<sup>32</sup> as adolescents we embrace a worldly intellectual or political trend, demonize its alternatives, and devote ourselves, as Santayana put it, to "not covet truth, but victory and the dispelling of their own doubts."<sup>33</sup> With humility and open minds we should read the great thinkers - to exercise our brains and<i> </i>to discover and refine nuggets of truth. As Paul advised, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>The ideal of Zion represents the destination of our spiritual journey. For every difficulty of physical, professional, or intellectual traveling - drifting, obstacles, sidetracks, pitfalls, wrong conclusions, and sophomoric pride - there are spiritual equivalents with spiritual consequences. But the stakes are higher. I remember a time when our family was ordering pizza; my children debated whether to get pepperoni or another topping. The debate ended when one of them said, "Well, its not a life-or-death decision."</p>
<p>According to Alma, the choices we make on our lifes spiritual track, however, really are life-or-death decisions, with "joy" accompanying (spiritual) life and "remorse of conscience" accompanying (spiritual) death.<sup>35</sup> For precisely that reason, less than two months ago Elder Bednar taught us about spiritual discernment.<sup>36</sup> If you have "cut-and-paste" functions in your mind, insert what he said here. I add a few observations from my own experience.</p>
<p>Spiritual discernment helps us to perceive our own lapses and lacks. I have met persons whose pride or enmity for God blinded them to their sins and so to their very eternal predicament. To such was Samuel talking when he called "unto the Lord, . . . that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great."<sup>37</sup> As Paul put it, "There is none righteous. . . . For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"; so every human needs "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."<sup>38</sup></p>
<p>But I have met others whose keen awareness of their past and present failings - and of their inability to overcome these on their own - have in effect blinded them to the grace of the Atonement and to the miracles of repentance and forgiveness. Reasoning that "I am unworthy, so the Savior cant redeem me" constitutes a spiritual <i>non sequitur.</i><sup>39</sup></p>
<p>Beyond enabling us to recognize our foibles, spiritual discernment helps us to see and feel Gods goodness, love, and redemptive power. Like the abilities to discern the worlds best destinations and to intellectually discern nuggets of truth from speculation or sophistry, spiritual discernment becomes stronger and sharper through use. A doctor once showed me an X-ray and said, "You can plainly see the problem right here." But, having no experience reading X-rays, I could see nothing but fuzzy blurs. The doctor could read X-rays because he did so every day. By seeking the Light of Christ every day, we increase our capacity to discern good from evil by its illumination. By listening to the Holy Ghost every day, we learn to hear more clearly the "still small voice."<sup>40</sup></p>
<p>Babylons happiness is attained, as Shakespeare put it, through attracting "Fortune and mens eyes."<sup>41</sup> Babylons hedonism is so pervasive and potent that many defer until the afterlife the possibility of Zions happiness - entailing personal and group righteousness and holiness. But the Lord clearly seeks to "establish Zion" among us here and now.<sup>42</sup> That begs the key question: How can we establish Zion while dwelling in Babylon? We can do it, in effect, by sanctifying the nooks and crannies of Babylon that are nearest to us - our own bodies and minds, our families and homes, our wards and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We start with our personal core and proceed outward to whatever periphery our influence can reach. If we are blessed with wealth, we consecrate it to the Lord - who told Martin Harris not to covet his own property.<sup>43</sup> If we are blessed with learning, we devote it to strengthening Gods enterprises and His children - our brothers and sisters.<sup>44</sup> In that regard, so many scriptures pair worshipping God with serving our fellow beings that we must regard them as symbiotic, mutually necessary endeavors. We cant serve God effectively without serving each other effectively.</p>
<p>Some of my best experiences with the growth of spiritual discernment have come while serving at the BYU Jerusalem Center. Some students would arrive - fresh from Babylon - boasting of their thrilling amusements to get attention. But then they went to the hill east of Bethel to reflect on the covenant of Abraham, to Mount Sinai to contemplate that of Moses, and to Mount Ebal to think about Joshuas rededication. They visited Nazareth to see where Jesus "grew, and waxed strong in spirit."<sup>45</sup> They traveled into the Judean wilderness to consider the resolve with which He began His ministry, to Galilee to ponder His Sermon on the Mount and the principles of His higher law, to Mount Tabor to recall His Transfiguration, then back to Jerusalem to study His healing miracles. In a culminating journey they walked from Bethany over the Mount of Olives to Gethsemane, then across the Kidron Valley to the possible sites of Golgotha and the nearby tomb in a garden. That evening they reenacted the Last Supper.</p>
<p>By then I could feel that most students were forsaking Babylon and approaching Zion. As they recommitted themselves to serving God better, they simultaneously shifted their concerns from their own comforts and conceits to the welfare of their classmates and others within the reach of their positive influence. Such commitments each of us has made and remade many times - in premortal life, at baptism, in the temple, and every Sabbath when we partake of the sacramental emblems. I pray that we shall perform our next act of covenant renewal with greater resolve, confidence, and purpose.</p>
<p>I pray that we shall resolve to discern our way to worthy destinations in mortal life; that we shall resolve to strengthen our minds to appreciate with exhilaration our intellectual heritage, to understand our complex world more fully, and to love the Lord and serve His children more effectively; and that we shall resolve to consecrate and sanctify ourselves, our assets, and our environments. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Over the past several decades my wife, Lisa, faithfully stood at our door to send our children off as they left our home for school. Without exception, she would call to them - usually in her pajamas - and say, "Stand up straight, smile, and remember who you are! Youre a Richardson, a child of God!"
Without taking a breath, she would then say our family motto: "Reverence. Respect. Responsibility. Resourcefulness."
And then, with the excitement of a cheerleader, she would roll her arms and say the final word: "Reeesolve."
Oh, but wait, she wasnt quite finished. She would cap it all off with an enthusiastic "Be a light!"
After our children heard this charge nearly every day of their young lives, is it any wonder that this ritual has been forever engrained in their memories - and in the memories of their friends and quite possibly of our neighbors?
With this image fresh in your mind, I would like to focus on the first part of my wifes simple but profound instruction: "Stand up straight, smile, and remember who you are." BYU has impacted my ability to stand up straight, has influenced why I smile, and has greatly molded who I am today. I have been privileged to be part of this university as a student, a professor, and now an administrator for more than three decades.
I know what you are thinking, and yes, three decades is a very long time - and yes, I am old. After all these years you would think that I would know my way around campus, which I do; understand more about honor and integrity from the Honor Code, which I do; know all of "The Cougar Fight Song," which I do; and know and enjoy BYUs history and culture, which I do. Yet there are certain things about BYU that I earnestly hope I will never forget.
President Ezra Taft Benson once said, "It is our privilege to store our memories with good and great thoughts and bring them out on the stage of our minds at will."1 Sadly, remembering even the good and great thoughts can be difficult.
I am confident that you, of all people, understand this well. After all, you have been taking quizzes and midterms lately and probably know that sick feeling in which your head is like a balloon with a small hole and all your preparation at the library is leaking out at an alarming rate as you make your way to the Testing Center. Oh sure, you try and pump your head up again by quickly reading through the stack of note cards as you walk, but you know deep down that all the good stuff is leaking out just as fast as you are putting it in.
There is great power in knowledge, but it seems that there is even greater power in remembering. President Spencer W. Kimball once asked, "When you look in the dictionary for the most important word, do you know what it is?"
He then answered, "It could be remember."2
With everything you have tucked away, there are some thin</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Sister Jensen and I are pleased to be with you. I sincerely thank the choir for not only how they sang, but also for what they sang. Hymns do invite the Spirit of the Lord. They create a feeling of reverence and teach us the doctrines of the kingdom. This is a very humbling assignment, and I have prayed, and continue to pray, for the Holy Ghost to be our true teacher.
My message is titled "The Unspeakable Gift of the Holy Ghost," a phrase from the Doctrine and Covenants: "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now" (D&amp;C 121:26). You may recognize a few thoughts from a general conference talk I gave in October 2010. With the time given me for this message today, I will expand them further.
The Importance of the Holy Ghost
 The importance of the Holy Ghost and that He is an unspeakable gift may be emphasized with two illustrations, each a message in its own right. The first illustration is from the Book of Mormon and the second from an event in Church history.
When Jesus Christ visited the people in the Book of Mormon, He taught them, blessed their children, instituted the sacrament, and then departed. The people returned to their homes and labored through the night to gather others to be at the place where He said He would appear to them the next day.
Because of the large numbers, the twelve disciples separated the people into twelve groups to teach them what the Savior had taught them the previous day, and then they prayed. Of all the things for which they could pray, "they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them" (3 Nephi 19:9), giving an emphasis to the Holy Ghost and His importance that is unique in all scripture.
Following their prayer and in answer to their pleadings, Nephi baptized the disciples, after which "the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire" (3 Nephi 19:13). They received the convincing witness or testimony of Him.
The Savior then appeared to them:
And it came to pass that Jesus . . . went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said:
 Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen. . . .
 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words. [3 Nephi 19:1921]
I know of no scriptural passage that better expresses how important our Savior feels the Holy Ghost is.
The second illustration comes from the teachings of President Brigham Young. The Saints were in Winter Quarters and preparing for the migration to the West in the spring. Joseph Smith had been dead for over two and one half years. President Young had a vision, a dream, in which he visited </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful and humbled by this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speak to you today. I still remember with fondness the day in 1971 when my friend and I loaded up his Volkswagen Bug and left Concord, California, for Provo, Utah, to begin our studies at Brigham Young University. Ever since we came around the Point of the Mountain and first saw the large block Y on the mountainside, I have had an abiding love of BYU. Brigham Young University is such a unique institution. I have a research lab in the Widtsoe Building and occasionally need to check on experiments over the weekend. One Sunday I brought my young son, Caleb, with me. We ended up parking pretty far away, because so many students were parked on campus for their Sunday meetings. I explained to Caleb that, on Sunday, many of the rooms on campus are used for church. This little seven-year-old boy made the following astute observation: "So, BYU is a school, its where you work, and its a church." Yes, BYU is all of those things.
I pray that the Spirit of the Holy Ghost will be with me and with you during our time together. I want to talk about receiving and recognizing the Holy Ghost. I will draw on my background in endocrinology to provide analogies that illustrate many of the points I want to make. If you suffer from "biology anxiety," let me assure you that I will make the analogies as simple as possible so as not to create undue stress. I also want to start with the disclaimer that when it comes to receiving and recognizing the Spirit, I still have many things to learn myself.
Endocrinology is the study of hormones. Hormones are chemical mediators that are delivered to the blood by endocrine glands. These hormones are then carried by the blood to distant cells, where they exert their effects. For example, growth hormone is secreted into the blood by the pituitary gland, a tiny gland at the base of your brain, and travels to distant sites, where it helps bring about growth during our developing years. Even though blood flows to virtually every cell in the body, not every cell is able to respond to a particular hormone. Only cells that have a receptor specific for the hormone will respond. A receptor is a protein on the surface of the cell that can bind to the hormone much like a key fits into a lock. Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a cascade of events is activated that leads to the hormone action in the target cell. However, even though the blood may be filled with a certain hormone, many cells will be unaffected by that hormone because they do not have the right receptor. The hormone passes right by these cells without exerting any effect. In a like manner, do the promptings of the Holy Ghost ever pass us by without being received?
Following baptism we were confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and were given the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Melchizedek Priesthood holder who pronounced our confirmation used the</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, despite my anxiety over the assignment I have been asked to fill today, I am truly pleased to be with you. I am grateful for the support I have received from colleagues and friends. I express particular gratitude to my sweet wife, Angela, who supports me today and always.
You have heard that I am an electrical engineer, and this leads me to a confession: I am a classic science geek. Shocking, I know. I am fascinated by the workings of our world, and I love to learn and to teach about them. I am guilty of soliciting opportunities to give science demonstrations to kids, even ones as young as four years old. After all, you can never start geek training too early.
One scientific discovery that has always fascinated me is the laser, which was first demonstrated in the early 1960s. To illustrate what makes this light source so interesting, let me make a quick comparison between light generated in a fluorescent bulb and light generated in a laser. In a fluorescent bulb, the gas molecules in the bulb are energized into an excited state by an electric current, and then they spontaneously and randomly release light as they transition to their original energy state. The resulting light moves in different directions and, in fact, will be different colors, which is why most fluorescent light is white. In the case of the laser, the excited molecules release their light energy in response to other light energy hitting the molecule. Amazingly, under this circumstance the released light is identical to the incident light in direction, color, and other characteristics, and as a result the light is particularly intense. As an analogy, consider how people engaged in a tug-of-war can be most effective when they all pull at precisely the same time. The laser light source is powerful despite the fact that it does not consume a lot of electrical power.
This scientific phenomenon reminds me of the account in the Book of Mormon of the Nephites gathering together immediately before the appearance of the resurrected Savior. We read:
And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, . . . yea, it did pierce them to the very soul. [3 Nephi 11:3]
To me this voice is a lot like a laser: not loud but powerful and pointed. Of course this was the voice of the Father introducing the Savior to the Nephites, but it seems that the voice of the Holy Ghost could be described in a similar way. This scriptural story also tells us that the Nephites heard the voice twice without understanding it. The third time, they understood it only because they "did open their ears to hear it" (3 Nephi 11:5). I</span>
