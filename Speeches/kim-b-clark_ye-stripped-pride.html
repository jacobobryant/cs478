  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am grateful to be with you today. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us and that you and I might be taught and edified by the Spirit.

One summer many, many years ago, my mother decided it would be a great project for her children to refinish the dining room chairs. The chairs were painted a dark cherry color, and my mother had discovered that underneath that paint was good, hard maple wood.

I will never forget that experience. We began by applying a nasty solvent called toluene to all the painted surfaces, and then we scraped the paint off. Once the paint was removed, we had to sand the wood with several grades of sandpaper in order to remove the very last bits of paint and to prepare the wood for a new finish. When the sanding was finally done, we applied a finish to highlight the grain and enhance the woods natural color. In the final step we sealed the new hardwood finish with two coats of varnish. Those chairs were transformed!

I think about that experience every time I read Almas penetrating question to the members of the Church in Zarahemla:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The words "are ye stripped of pride?" evoke in me images and smells from that summer. I think of toluene and scraping and stripping and sanding to get down to bare wood. When I think of the finishing process with a vibrant color and the protecting sealing varnish, I think of the description of the Savior as "the author and finisher of our faith"&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the words of King Benjamin to his people:

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

My message today is about being stripped of pride. I want to talk with you about overcoming pride and becoming humble followers of Christ.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pride - The Universal Sin, the Great Vice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson delivered a powerful sermon on pride. It is a talk all of us should read carefully and often. Speaking in general conference, President Benson said:

&lt;i&gt;The central feature of pride is enmity - enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen.&lt;/i&gt; Enmity &lt;i&gt;means "hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition." It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Pride affects all of us at various times and in various degrees. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Pride is the universal sin, the great vice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Pride in all of its manifestations has played a central role in the struggle between good and evil, a struggle going back to the War in Heaven. The seriousness of the sin of pride is rooted deep in the doctrines of salvation.

In premortality we lived with our Heavenly Father as spirit sons and daughters. In the premortal council, Heavenly Father presented His great plan of happiness through which we could obtain immortality and eternal life.

Our Father knew that all of us would sin and "come short of the glory of God,"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; so He sent His Beloved Son to atone for our sins, redeem us, and give us the strengthening power to become more like Him and our Father and ultimately receive the greatest gift of God - eternal life.

Here is the Great Truth in the Fathers plan: Through the Atonement of Christ we can receive peace, joy, happiness, and eternal life with our Heavenly Father. There is a Redeemer! Jesus Christ, the Holy One of Israel, is the only "name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

The Fathers plan was not received well by all of His children. Lucifer, a son of the morning, rebelled against the Father, against His Beloved Son, and against the plan. He presented his own proposal:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

There are several things to note about Satans proposal:

1. Satan would replace Christ; indeed, there was no need for Christ and no need for an atoning sacrifice at all.

2. There would be no agency. Everyone would be redeemed; no one would be lost.

3. It would surely happen, and Satan would be the sole reason why.

4. Therefore, he should have Gods honor and glory.

Here, in stark contrast to the Fathers plan and the Great Truth, was Satans Great Lie: You can obtain joy, happiness, and eternal life without Christ, without God, and without any special effort on your part; and Satan would make all this happen without any sacrifice, pain, or suffering on his part - rather by the sheer force of his power.

It was and is the Great Lie by the father of lies. It would not have worked. It was contrary to the will of the Father and to eternal laws of justice and mercy. And there, right in the middle of the Great Lie, at the very center of Satans rebellious, diabolical scheme, was pride. There was pride and all of its sordid offspring - arrogance, selfishness, greed, vain ambition, unrighteous dominion - on a cosmic scale.

The Father rejected Satans proposal. Then, driven by deep, deep pride and enmity toward the Father and the Son, Satan made war in heaven. He "accused [our brethren] before our God day and night"&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and pushed the Great Lie with such deception and persuasion that a third part of the hosts of heaven followed him. But the forces of righteousness "overcame [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; And so Satan "was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

Satan continues his war against God and us in the mortal world, where we are subject to the frailties, weaknesses, and temptations of the natural man. As it was in the premortal realm, so it is on earth; pride is at the heart of Satans war on God and on His children. It has been that way since the days of Adam.

But pride has become especially critical in our day. We live in the dispensation of the fulness of times when the Lord is blessing His children with great knowledge, remarkable technologies, expanded opportunities for learning, and unprecedented wealth. With these blessings, however, comes this warning from the Lord:

&lt;i&gt;It must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

Beware of pride! This is the warning voice of the Lord to us now, in our day. We have obtained so much control over the resources of the earth, so much understanding of the biology of life, so much capacity to travel and to communicate instantly that we have become "puffed up" in our learning and our apparent control and power. Pride and its children - materialism, envy, arrogance, greed, thirst for recognition, and lust for control and dominion - have become rampant in our culture and society. Modern Babylon is awash in pride.

The Book of Mormon prophets saw our day and spoke powerfully about modern-day pride. In his prophecy of the last days, Nephi saw that many would "be puffed up in their hearts"&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and "wear stiff necks and high heads."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

Hundreds of years later Moroni wrote these words about our day:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

The Book of Mormon was written for us. It bears witness of Jesus Christ and warns us of the perils of pride, both in prosperity and in adversity. In the story of Laman and Lemuel, we see two proud brothers who murmured and rebelled and were filled with resentment and anger in the face of the loss of their home and possessions, their afflictions in the wilderness, and their failed expectations of leadership. Despite visits from angels and even the voice of the Lord and many other blessings and miracles, pride took root in their souls, their hearts were hardened, and they rejected the Lord and His prophets.

We also see this same pattern of pride, hardness of heart, and rejection of the truth in the face of prosperity. Indeed, the Book of Mormon is a record of an entire people greatly favored of the Lord who succumbed to the temptations of pride, rejected the Lord, and were destroyed.

The message is clear: Whether in prosperity or in adversity, if we are not diligent and faithful, even the elect of God, even those greatly blessed by the Lord, can fall prey to the Great Lie and become hard-hearted, self-absorbed, stiff-necked, and puffed up in their pride.

This is something we see all too often. You may have seen the interaction of pride and adversity among people you know. Perhaps because of some setback or a failed expectation or some other problem, a faithful member of the Church feels some resentment, some sense of being a victim unfairly treated. That resentment grows and festers and feeds on pride until it turns to anger and even bitterness. Over the years the member stops coming to Church, fails to keep the commandments, and finds ways to rationalize sinful behavior.

Or perhaps you have seen the interaction of pride and prosperity. It happens to wonderful people who in their college years are full of promise. These are people of great ability and spirituality. They marry in the temple, attend some of the countrys finest graduate schools, and graduate with distinction. They are blessed with beautiful children and wonderful family lives. They are active in the Church and serve in positions of responsibility.

But something happens to them on the way to a life of service, joy, and happiness. What happens is pride. Somewhere along the way the honors of men, wealth, power, and recognition become more important than their love of the Lord, the love of their spouses and children, and their service in the kingdom. They divorce, leave the Church and their families, and become wholly worldly in their attitudes and their behavior.

The effects of pride, whether in adversity or in prosperity, are deadly. As Alma prophesied:

&lt;i&gt;They that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

This calamity comes little by little over time. Pride and its effects are like a thin film of darkness that begins to settle on the soul layer by layer, year by year, until the light of the gospel grows dim. Such people become hardened in their hearts, selfish in their behavior, and puffed up in the pride of their eyes.

There is always, of course, hope. The proud and selfish souls can come back. But after years of darkness and so many layers of pride, it will take a lot of spiritual solvent and a lot of spiritual scraping and sanding to get down to a bare soul and a soft heart. And think of the time they have wasted, the opportunities for growth and becoming that they have lost, the lives they could have saved, and the joy they could have received had they seen what was happening early on and acted on it to change. Had they just recognized those first thin films of pride, they might have repented and sought the Lords redeeming power right then. Had they seen it and acted, they could have humbled themselves and been stripped of pride.

Well did the Lord warn us: Beware of pride. Beware; be alert; be on guard against the perils of pride. May I suggest some things to watch for, some things of which we should all beware? I think of this list as red flags of pride. These red flags are like the little flags that landscapers put on the lawn when they have applied dangerous chemicals. Thin films of pride come with warning flags like the following:

1. Do you find yourself critiquing the talks in sacrament meeting?

2. Are you critical of others? Do you look down on others? Do you scorn or ridicule them?

3. When adversity strikes, do you hear a voice inside that says, "Why me?"

4. Do you react to prophetic counsel by ignoring it, being upset by it, or interpreting it to suit your own desires?

5. When you do something good, do you hear a voice inside congratulating yourself?

6. Do you feel self-gratification and a sense of importance in your knowledge and skill?

7. If someone you know receives something good, do you hear a voice inside saying, "What about me?"

8. Do you find ways to let others know of your success without appearing to boast?

9. If someone corrects a mistake you made, do you feel defensive and resentful?

10. When someone does something that creates inconvenience for you, do you feel annoyed?

I could go on. There are many, many red flags of pride.

Brothers and sisters, I did not get this list from a book. I have firsthand experience with the questions I have asked you, and I know that if you and I ever feel any of them or hear any of them in our minds, we need to recognize them for what they are - the echoes of the Great Lie, the beginning of a call to enmity with our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

In that moment of recognition, we stand at a crossroads between two paths. We can follow the path of the Great Lie and act on those prideful feelings, or we can follow the path of the Great Truth and choose Christ. It is a choice. Are we going to keep our covenants, or are we going to break them? To reject the Great Lie and choose Christ takes an act of will. We have to consciously say to ourselves: "I am not going down the path of the Great Lie. With faith in Christ and with His help, I am going to walk the path of the Great Truth."

Heavenly Fathers plan to help us make that choice was beautifully summarized by Alma in his words to the people of Ammonihah:

&lt;i&gt;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

We must first catch ourselves in the moment when prideful thoughts or feelings come and then act in faith to choose Christ, seeking Gods help in prayer. This is what Alma meant when he admonished us to "humble [ourselves] before the Lord . . . and watch and pray continually."

But that is not the end. We must not only catch ourselves in prideful thoughts and feelings, not only choose Christ in that moment, but through the Atonement of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost repent of our sins, receive forgiveness, and be led by the Holy Spirit to become "humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering."

When we choose Christ, acting in faith to humble ourselves before Him, we put ourselves in the hands of the Master Finisher. As we do His will, He will help us be stripped of pride and become meek and lowly in heart, filled with His pure and perfect love.

The Lords finishing process may not always be pleasant. He will chasten and correct and give us experiences that polish us. If we are steadfast and immovable in doing what He wants us to do, we will not be deflected from the true path by adversity or prosperity. We will become the humble followers of Christ, and the day will come when He will seal us His.

Being stripped of pride and becoming meek and lowly in heart is not easy. We cannot do it by ourselves. But there are patterns of life we can establish that will help us beware of pride, remember Christ, humble ourselves before Him, and put ourselves in His hands. I will leave you today with four patterns:
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pattern Number 1: Never Do Anything to Drive the Spirit Away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Holy Ghost is essential to the Lords finishing process. But the Spirit is very sensitive to any degree of unrighteousness. Dont do anything or wear anything or say anything or read anything or listen to anything or watch anything or go anywhere that would drive the Spirit away.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pattern Number 2: Dont Let the World Get into Your Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Never set your heart on things - on money or houses or cars or clothes or any other thing. Dont let a career or power or the honors of men get into your heart. They can get there very easily if you are not careful. Set your heart on the Lord and His kingdom, on your family and the temple and the things of eternity. Always live modestly within your means, and always pay your tithing and give a generous fast offering.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pattern Number 3: Serve the Lord&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Accept and always magnify callings in the Church and volunteer to be of service in the kingdom. When the promptings of the Spirit come sending you on the Lords errand to rescue a lost soul or to comfort one in need, act on those promptings quickly as soon as you can.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pattern Number 4: Stand in Holy Places&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Make your home a sacred, holy place where the Spirit may dwell. Be in the chapel to partake of the sacrament every Sunday and prayerfully renew your covenant to "always remember him and keep his commandments."&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; If you live near a temple, go often to the house of the Lord. Relive those sacred ordinances and covenants. Reflect on your gratitude for the plan of salvation and for the Great Truth of the Atonement, on its power in your life, and on your need for the blessings and strength that are in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Brothers and sisters, I know that if we establish these patterns in our lives we will beware of pride, we will be true to our covenants, and we will be in the Masters hands. You and I have much work to do. The Lord is moving with power in the earth preparing us and the kingdom for His return. Given all the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, you and I need to be like Ammon, the son of Mosiah, a great and mighty missionary who said:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

This combination of humility and courage is what we need, and it is precisely what comes to those who reject the Great Lie and humble themselves before the Lord. Listen to the way President Henry B. Eyring described the process that occurs when we remember the Great Truth of the Savior and put ourselves in His hands:

&lt;i&gt;Those memories, if we choose to invite them, can produce a powerful blend of courage and meekness. No problem is too hard for us with his help. No price is too great to pay for what he offers us. And still in our greatest successes we feel as little children. And in our greatest sacrifices we still feel in his debt, wanting to give more. That is a humility which is energizing, not enervating. We can choose that shield as a protection against pride.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_child-god/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Brothers and sisters, our protection, our hope, our salvation is in Jesus Christ. I bear witness of Him, the Holy One of Israel, the Light and the Life of the World. He is the Living Son of the Living God. This is His church and kingdom. I know that if we humble ourselves before Him and put ourselves in His Hands, we will be stripped of pride and He will polish us and finish us and seal us His. I know that is true.

I invoke the blessings of our loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son upon you this day, that you may become the humble followers of Christ and that the peace, joy, happiness, and power of heaven may flow into your life and into the lives of your families and loved ones now and forever. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I am grateful to be with you today. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us and that you and I might be taught and edified by the Spirit.</p>
<p>One summer many, many years ago, my mother decided it would be a great project for her children to refinish the dining room chairs. The chairs were painted a dark cherry color, and my mother had discovered that underneath that paint was good, hard maple wood.</p>
<p>I will never forget that experience. We began by applying a nasty solvent called toluene to all the painted surfaces, and then we scraped the paint off. Once the paint was removed, we had to sand the wood with several grades of sandpaper in order to remove the very last bits of paint and to prepare the wood for a new finish. When the sanding was finally done, we applied a finish to highlight the grain and enhance the woods natural color. In the final step we sealed the new hardwood finish with two coats of varnish. Those chairs were transformed!</p>
<p>I think about that experience every time I read Almas penetrating question to the members of the Church in Zarahemla:</p>
<p><i>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The words "are ye stripped of pride?" evoke in me images and smells from that summer. I think of toluene and scraping and stripping and sanding to get down to bare wood. When I think of the finishing process with a vibrant color and the protecting sealing varnish, I think of the description of the Savior as "the author and finisher of our faith"<sup>2</sup> and the words of King Benjamin to his people:</p>
<p><i>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>My message today is about being stripped of pride. I want to talk with you about overcoming pride and becoming humble followers of Christ.</p>
<h2><b>Pride - The Universal Sin, the Great Vice</b></h2>
<p>Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson delivered a powerful sermon on pride. It is a talk all of us should read carefully and often. Speaking in general conference, President Benson said:</p>
<p><i>The central feature of pride is enmity - enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen.</i> Enmity <i>means "hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition." It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Pride affects all of us at various times and in various degrees. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Pride is the universal sin, the great vice.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Pride in all of its manifestations has played a central role in the struggle between good and evil, a struggle going back to the War in Heaven. The seriousness of the sin of pride is rooted deep in the doctrines of salvation.</p>
<p>In premortality we lived with our Heavenly Father as spirit sons and daughters. In the premortal council, Heavenly Father presented His great plan of happiness through which we could obtain immortality and eternal life.</p>
<p>Our Father knew that all of us would sin and "come short of the glory of God,"<sup>5</sup> so He sent His Beloved Son to atone for our sins, redeem us, and give us the strengthening power to become more like Him and our Father and ultimately receive the greatest gift of God - eternal life.</p>
<p>Here is the Great Truth in the Fathers plan: Through the Atonement of Christ we can receive peace, joy, happiness, and eternal life with our Heavenly Father. There is a Redeemer! Jesus Christ, the Holy One of Israel, is the only "name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The Fathers plan was not received well by all of His children. Lucifer, a son of the morning, rebelled against the Father, against His Beloved Son, and against the plan. He presented his own proposal:</p>
<p><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>There are several things to note about Satans proposal:</p>
<p>1. Satan would replace Christ; indeed, there was no need for Christ and no need for an atoning sacrifice at all.</p>
<p>2. There would be no agency. Everyone would be redeemed; no one would be lost.</p>
<p>3. It would surely happen, and Satan would be the sole reason why.</p>
<p>4. Therefore, he should have Gods honor and glory.</p>
<p>Here, in stark contrast to the Fathers plan and the Great Truth, was Satans Great Lie: You can obtain joy, happiness, and eternal life without Christ, without God, and without any special effort on your part; and Satan would make all this happen without any sacrifice, pain, or suffering on his part - rather by the sheer force of his power.</p>
<p>It was and is the Great Lie by the father of lies. It would not have worked. It was contrary to the will of the Father and to eternal laws of justice and mercy. And there, right in the middle of the Great Lie, at the very center of Satans rebellious, diabolical scheme, was pride. There was pride and all of its sordid offspring - arrogance, selfishness, greed, vain ambition, unrighteous dominion - on a cosmic scale.</p>
<p>The Father rejected Satans proposal. Then, driven by deep, deep pride and enmity toward the Father and the Son, Satan made war in heaven. He "accused [our brethren] before our God day and night"<sup>8</sup> and pushed the Great Lie with such deception and persuasion that a third part of the hosts of heaven followed him. But the forces of righteousness "overcame [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony."<sup>9</sup> And so Satan "was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Satan continues his war against God and us in the mortal world, where we are subject to the frailties, weaknesses, and temptations of the natural man. As it was in the premortal realm, so it is on earth; pride is at the heart of Satans war on God and on His children. It has been that way since the days of Adam.</p>
<p>But pride has become especially critical in our day. We live in the dispensation of the fulness of times when the Lord is blessing His children with great knowledge, remarkable technologies, expanded opportunities for learning, and unprecedented wealth. With these blessings, however, comes this warning from the Lord:</p>
<p><i>It must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.</i><sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Beware of pride! This is the warning voice of the Lord to us now, in our day. We have obtained so much control over the resources of the earth, so much understanding of the biology of life, so much capacity to travel and to communicate instantly that we have become "puffed up" in our learning and our apparent control and power. Pride and its children - materialism, envy, arrogance, greed, thirst for recognition, and lust for control and dominion - have become rampant in our culture and society. Modern Babylon is awash in pride.</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon prophets saw our day and spoke powerfully about modern-day pride. In his prophecy of the last days, Nephi saw that many would "be puffed up in their hearts"<sup>12</sup> and "wear stiff necks and high heads."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Hundreds of years later Moroni wrote these words about our day:</p>
<p><i>Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.</i></p>
<p><i>And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts.</i><sup>14</sup></p>
<p>The Book of Mormon was written for us. It bears witness of Jesus Christ and warns us of the perils of pride, both in prosperity and in adversity. In the story of Laman and Lemuel, we see two proud brothers who murmured and rebelled and were filled with resentment and anger in the face of the loss of their home and possessions, their afflictions in the wilderness, and their failed expectations of leadership. Despite visits from angels and even the voice of the Lord and many other blessings and miracles, pride took root in their souls, their hearts were hardened, and they rejected the Lord and His prophets.</p>
<p>We also see this same pattern of pride, hardness of heart, and rejection of the truth in the face of prosperity. Indeed, the Book of Mormon is a record of an entire people greatly favored of the Lord who succumbed to the temptations of pride, rejected the Lord, and were destroyed.</p>
<p>The message is clear: Whether in prosperity or in adversity, if we are not diligent and faithful, even the elect of God, even those greatly blessed by the Lord, can fall prey to the Great Lie and become hard-hearted, self-absorbed, stiff-necked, and puffed up in their pride.</p>
<p>This is something we see all too often. You may have seen the interaction of pride and adversity among people you know. Perhaps because of some setback or a failed expectation or some other problem, a faithful member of the Church feels some resentment, some sense of being a victim unfairly treated. That resentment grows and festers and feeds on pride until it turns to anger and even bitterness. Over the years the member stops coming to Church, fails to keep the commandments, and finds ways to rationalize sinful behavior.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you have seen the interaction of pride and prosperity. It happens to wonderful people who in their college years are full of promise. These are people of great ability and spirituality. They marry in the temple, attend some of the countrys finest graduate schools, and graduate with distinction. They are blessed with beautiful children and wonderful family lives. They are active in the Church and serve in positions of responsibility.</p>
<p>But something happens to them on the way to a life of service, joy, and happiness. What happens is pride. Somewhere along the way the honors of men, wealth, power, and recognition become more important than their love of the Lord, the love of their spouses and children, and their service in the kingdom. They divorce, leave the Church and their families, and become wholly worldly in their attitudes and their behavior.</p>
<p>The effects of pride, whether in adversity or in prosperity, are deadly. As Alma prophesied:</p>
<p><i>They that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p>This calamity comes little by little over time. Pride and its effects are like a thin film of darkness that begins to settle on the soul layer by layer, year by year, until the light of the gospel grows dim. Such people become hardened in their hearts, selfish in their behavior, and puffed up in the pride of their eyes.</p>
<p>There is always, of course, hope. The proud and selfish souls can come back. But after years of darkness and so many layers of pride, it will take a lot of spiritual solvent and a lot of spiritual scraping and sanding to get down to a bare soul and a soft heart. And think of the time they have wasted, the opportunities for growth and becoming that they have lost, the lives they could have saved, and the joy they could have received had they seen what was happening early on and acted on it to change. Had they just recognized those first thin films of pride, they might have repented and sought the Lords redeeming power right then. Had they seen it and acted, they could have humbled themselves and been stripped of pride.</p>
<p>Well did the Lord warn us: Beware of pride. Beware; be alert; be on guard against the perils of pride. May I suggest some things to watch for, some things of which we should all beware? I think of this list as red flags of pride. These red flags are like the little flags that landscapers put on the lawn when they have applied dangerous chemicals. Thin films of pride come with warning flags like the following:</p>
<p>1. Do you find yourself critiquing the talks in sacrament meeting?</p>
<p>2. Are you critical of others? Do you look down on others? Do you scorn or ridicule them?</p>
<p>3. When adversity strikes, do you hear a voice inside that says, "Why me?"</p>
<p>4. Do you react to prophetic counsel by ignoring it, being upset by it, or interpreting it to suit your own desires?</p>
<p>5. When you do something good, do you hear a voice inside congratulating yourself?</p>
<p>6. Do you feel self-gratification and a sense of importance in your knowledge and skill?</p>
<p>7. If someone you know receives something good, do you hear a voice inside saying, "What about me?"</p>
<p>8. Do you find ways to let others know of your success without appearing to boast?</p>
<p>9. If someone corrects a mistake you made, do you feel defensive and resentful?</p>
<p>10. When someone does something that creates inconvenience for you, do you feel annoyed?</p>
<p>I could go on. There are many, many red flags of pride.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I did not get this list from a book. I have firsthand experience with the questions I have asked you, and I know that if you and I ever feel any of them or hear any of them in our minds, we need to recognize them for what they are - the echoes of the Great Lie, the beginning of a call to enmity with our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In that moment of recognition, we stand at a crossroads between two paths. We can follow the path of the Great Lie and act on those prideful feelings, or we can follow the path of the Great Truth and choose Christ. It is a choice. Are we going to keep our covenants, or are we going to break them? To reject the Great Lie and choose Christ takes an act of will. We have to consciously say to ourselves: "I am not going down the path of the Great Lie. With faith in Christ and with His help, I am going to walk the path of the Great Truth."</p>
<p>Heavenly Fathers plan to help us make that choice was beautifully summarized by Alma in his words to the people of Ammonihah:</p>
<p><i>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering.</i><sup>16</sup></p>
<p>We must first catch ourselves in the moment when prideful thoughts or feelings come and then act in faith to choose Christ, seeking Gods help in prayer. This is what Alma meant when he admonished us to "humble [ourselves] before the Lord . . . and watch and pray continually."</p>
<p>But that is not the end. We must not only catch ourselves in prideful thoughts and feelings, not only choose Christ in that moment, but through the Atonement of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost repent of our sins, receive forgiveness, and be led by the Holy Spirit to become "humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering."</p>
<p>When we choose Christ, acting in faith to humble ourselves before Him, we put ourselves in the hands of the Master Finisher. As we do His will, He will help us be stripped of pride and become meek and lowly in heart, filled with His pure and perfect love.</p>
<p>The Lords finishing process may not always be pleasant. He will chasten and correct and give us experiences that polish us. If we are steadfast and immovable in doing what He wants us to do, we will not be deflected from the true path by adversity or prosperity. We will become the humble followers of Christ, and the day will come when He will seal us His.</p>
<p>Being stripped of pride and becoming meek and lowly in heart is not easy. We cannot do it by ourselves. But there are patterns of life we can establish that will help us beware of pride, remember Christ, humble ourselves before Him, and put ourselves in His hands. I will leave you today with four patterns:</p>
<h2><b>Pattern Number 1: Never Do Anything to Drive the Spirit Away</b></h2>
<p>The Holy Ghost is essential to the Lords finishing process. But the Spirit is very sensitive to any degree of unrighteousness. Dont do anything or wear anything or say anything or read anything or listen to anything or watch anything or go anywhere that would drive the Spirit away.</p>
<h2><b>Pattern Number 2: Dont Let the World Get into Your Heart</b></h2>
<p>Never set your heart on things - on money or houses or cars or clothes or any other thing. Dont let a career or power or the honors of men get into your heart. They can get there very easily if you are not careful. Set your heart on the Lord and His kingdom, on your family and the temple and the things of eternity. Always live modestly within your means, and always pay your tithing and give a generous fast offering.</p>
<h2><b>Pattern Number 3: Serve the Lord</b></h2>
<p>Accept and always magnify callings in the Church and volunteer to be of service in the kingdom. When the promptings of the Spirit come sending you on the Lords errand to rescue a lost soul or to comfort one in need, act on those promptings quickly as soon as you can.</p>
<h2><b>Pattern Number 4: Stand in Holy Places</b></h2>
<p>Make your home a sacred, holy place where the Spirit may dwell. Be in the chapel to partake of the sacrament every Sunday and prayerfully renew your covenant to "always remember him and keep his commandments."<sup>17</sup> If you live near a temple, go often to the house of the Lord. Relive those sacred ordinances and covenants. Reflect on your gratitude for the plan of salvation and for the Great Truth of the Atonement, on its power in your life, and on your need for the blessings and strength that are in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I know that if we establish these patterns in our lives we will beware of pride, we will be true to our covenants, and we will be in the Masters hands. You and I have much work to do. The Lord is moving with power in the earth preparing us and the kingdom for His return. Given all the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, you and I need to be like Ammon, the son of Mosiah, a great and mighty missionary who said:</p>
<p><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.</i><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>This combination of humility and courage is what we need, and it is precisely what comes to those who reject the Great Lie and humble themselves before the Lord. Listen to the way President Henry B. Eyring described the process that occurs when we remember the Great Truth of the Savior and put ourselves in His hands:</p>
<p><i>Those memories, if we choose to invite them, can produce a powerful blend of courage and meekness. No problem is too hard for us with his help. No price is too great to pay for what he offers us. And still in our greatest successes we feel as little children. And in our greatest sacrifices we still feel in his debt, wanting to give more. That is a humility which is energizing, not enervating. We can choose that shield as a protection against pride.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_child-god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, our protection, our hope, our salvation is in Jesus Christ. I bear witness of Him, the Holy One of Israel, the Light and the Life of the World. He is the Living Son of the Living God. This is His church and kingdom. I know that if we humble ourselves before Him and put ourselves in His Hands, we will be stripped of pride and He will polish us and finish us and seal us His. I know that is true.</p>
<p>I invoke the blessings of our loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son upon you this day, that you may become the humble followers of Christ and that the peace, joy, happiness, and power of heaven may flow into your life and into the lives of your families and loved ones now and forever. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a joy and a blessing to address you this morning. You are such a remarkable generation in the history of gospel dispensations! Recently I participated in a dinner honoring the ambassador of a European nation. He had just finished a full day of visiting Church sites in Utah. I asked him what had impressed him the most. His face suddenly changed, and he responded in a voice charged with emotion, "What touched me most was the visit to the BYU campus and the Missionary Training Center. What beautiful youth you have!"
Last year when the Lord decided to hasten His work, it was to the youth of the Church that He made the call. Following the announcement by President Thomas S. Monson that the ages for serving missions had been lowered, a wonderful wave of enthusiasm came across the Church. Tens of thousands of your generation are responding to the call of the prophet.
Perhaps the change in mission age was a surprise for many people - especially those outside of the Church. Some probably wondered, "Why would the Church put so much responsibility in the hands of inexperienced young people who are barely out of high school?"
I remember asking the following question of several mission presidents: "Rather than young volunteers of eighteen or nineteen years of age, if we offered to send you professional missionaries who were older and had great command of the scriptures, missionary lessons, missionary methods, and language of the country, would you take them?"
They all answered without hesitation, "No, thank you. We love our young missionaries."
What is so beautiful and powerful in having a missionary force essentially composed of young men and young women without much experience? The scriptures are filled with stories of young and modest people who, having great faith and being magnified by the power of God, accomplished exceptional things. Among them were Enoch, who considered himself to be "a lad" who was "slow of speech";1 Joseph Smith, who described himself as "an obscure boy" and "of no consequence in the world";2 and the Virgin Mary, who marveled that she had been chosen to become the Lords mother, saying, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, . . . for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden."3
These great young people had pure and humble hearts. Yet the Lord made them powerful in words and deeds to accomplish His designs. The scripture was fulfilled that said, "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty."4
My brothers and sisters, this scripture is now truer than ever before. I often think of the enormous challenges facing your generation. You are living in an often hostile world at a time when great personal strength must be used to maintain righteousness a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I was young, my parents reminded me often that it is better to give than to receive. I used to hear this frequently at Christmastime. The statement is true enough, because the natural man is selfish, and learning how not to be selfish is one of lifes most important pursuits.
But today I would like to discuss the reasons why it is important that we learn how to receive. Because this is a lesson that I am trying to learn myself, much of my address will be autobiographical.
When I graduated from high school, I had the opportunity to spend the summer and fall with two friends working in a factory in a city far from home. We attended the local branch of the Church. The members there thought we were an interesting bunch - three young men away from home, going to work in a factory each day doing things we werent particularly good at, yet obviously surviving from day to day.
We often received invitations from branch members to have dinner at their homes, and we always turned them down. It wasnt until years later that I realized that to do so was a big mistake. You see, we turned them down because we thought it was the noble thing to do. We had sufficient finances, we could take care of ourselves, andwe didnt want to inconvenience anyone. We didnt realize at the time that in not accepting invitations to dinner, we were missing out on good experiences and fellowship with kindly Latter-day Saints. But, more important, we were depriving others of the blessing of serving us, and we were depriving ourselves of the blessing of receiving their service. Our real issue, of course, was pride. We were too proud to receive service from others who wished simply to bless our lives.
It is remarkable how often the scriptures teach that we must receive. For example, when we are confirmed members of the Church, we are told to "receive" the Holy Ghost. We cannot compel or conjure the Spirits presence; we can only receive what has been freely offered. Likewise, the verb commonly used with the phrase "remission of sin" is receive. We cant make a remission of sin, earn it, attain it, or create it. Our faithfulness is required, but it is Jesus agency that brings the remission of our sins to pass. And, finally, we are to be perfect, but we cannot perfect ourselves. The Book of Mormon teaches that we are to be "perfected" in Christ, something that is done "by his grace" (Moroni 10:32). The passive voice shows that we are not the doers of the verb but the receivers. Indeed, any notion that we have of personal spiritual accomplishment or self-sufficiency is shattered as we read the scriptures and come to a better understanding of the gospel. Peter learned this lesson the hard way when he refused Jesus humble act of servitude, saying, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus responded, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">President Samuelson; trustees, faculty, and staff of Brigham Young University; honored guests; parents; family members; and graduates: My dear brothers and sisters, Sister Christofferson and I offer our congratulations, respect, and love to all of you. We thank you for the privilege of being with you on this grand occasion and rejoice with you in the achievements that we honor today. We are pleased to have been authorized to convey to you the greetings of President Thomas S. Monson, his counselors in the First Presidency, and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We extend those greetings and their commendations most warmly.
In preparing my remarks to you, I have determined not to follow the example of my brother, the Apostle Paul, when he spoke to the Saints in Troas. It is reported in the book of Acts that "upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."1 The cartoonist Garry Trudeau is purported to have said, "Commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated."2 Ill do what I can, but I dont want to over-sedate you.
It is traditional, of course, in graduation speeches to offer counsel. One sage proffered this advice: "Your families are extremely proud of you. You cant imagine the sense of relief they are experiencing. This would be a most opportune time to ask for money."3 Then there are references to the wisdom of the ages. I remember my fathers aphorism repeated often with some exasperation to his five sons: "For every mistake made for not knowing, 10 are made for not looking." This afternoon, however, I would like to call upon the insights of our departed friend and colleague Professor Hugh Nibley.
We knew Professor Nibley as a man of superior intellect and honest spirituality. I remember my first sighting of him during my freshman year at BYU. It was in the library as I passed a table laden with perhaps two dozen books, most of them open and stacked one upon another in a semicircle in front of an empty chair. As I wondered who could possibly absorb all of that material in one sitting, the legendary scholar appeared out of the stacks carrying three or four more books. I tried not to stare, but it wouldnt have mattered; Professor Nibley ignored me completely and dove into the books. I was impressed and more than a little motivated. I wish I could tell you that after that experience I never again slumped over a library desk with my face in a book asleep, but dishonesty would be unbecoming in someone in my position.
Hugh Nibley was a graduate student at Berkeley during the Great Depression. He was able to finance his education there with some struggle and a translation job that fortuitously </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In the summer of 1971 I was an undergraduate here at BYU and had been home from a mission for less than a year. I was in school and working hard in classes and at a part-time job.
I was assigned by my elders quorum president to home teach several people that summer.
My companion and I began contacting our people, two of whom were not much involved in the Church at the time. One of these was an attractive young lady who lived alone in a basement apartment. She seldom attended Sunday meetings and didnt "do appointments" with home teachers. She would talk to us if we happened to catch her at her apartment. It usually took several attempts each month to connect with her. As the weeks passed, we made a special effort to get to know her. I think she was beginning to trust us, and even like us. She was becoming less evasive and guarded.
She was an interesting and engaging person. Attractive and witty, she held her own in conversation. She resisted being anyones service project and telegraphed just enough cynicism and mistrust to keep herself isolated from the well-intentioned. I sensed that she had been injured by people she had trusted the most and that her edginess and cynical humor were worn for self-protection. I was beginning to take on this relationship as a personal challenge, and Ill admit that I was beginning to enjoy the challenge.
One day, walking alone past her apartment on my way to campus, I decided to stop and knock on her door and see if I could catch her at home. I had some pretext for stopping. I dont remember what it was, but it was enough of an excuse to make the call seem comfortable. No one answered the door, so I went on my way.
A few days later I was in the company of my brother, Gene, who was serving in the bishopric of the same ward I was attending. He had just extended a calling to me in an interview and we were visiting for a few minutes before his next appointment. He asked me about my home teaching assignments and particularly how our efforts were going at helping this young lady. I mentioned casually that I had recently stopped by her place on my way to the campus but hadnt found her home.
At that moment the expression on my brothers face changed visibly. He looked carefully at me, put his hand on my forearm, and with that voice and expression I had come to know so well - the voice of the older brother - he said, "Michael, dont ever, ever go over there on your own. Dont risk being alone with her by yourself. Take your companion or call one of your quorum leaders or call me, but dont go alone."
I nodded and mumbled something like "fine" or "okay" and changed the subject to something that would let me quickly end the conversation. I ended it and left. I dont know to this day if my brother heard the edge in my voice or noticed that I was suddenly very turned off. I was eager to get out of there and to get away from him. I was mad</span>
