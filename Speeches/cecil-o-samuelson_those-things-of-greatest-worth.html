  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is with considerable pleasure and appreciation that I again voice my welcome to all of you as we honor and commend those being recognized as graduates and honorees in the program of the day. As many of us will emphasize in these exercises today and tomorrow, the achievements we celebrate are not solo acts. That is, virtually no one being honored has been able to reach the heights of accomplishment alone. Therefore we commend spouses, children, parents, friends, mentors, teachers, advisors, and all others who have contributed to the remarkable attainments we acknowledge in these ceremonies.

Today we are especially honored to have as our presiding authority and commencement speaker Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Virtually all here know him well, and we are grateful that he and Sister Perry are with us as two of the most avid and loyal supporters of Brigham Young University.

I hope all of you heard Elder Perry’s general conference address earlier this month. I advise you to read it again in the &lt;i&gt;Ensign&lt;/i&gt; in the coming May edition or listen to it again online. I will not say more except to commend it to you and confess that his assessment about the increasing casualness in our society today about the Ten Commandments brought to my mind a favorite commencement address given twenty-six years ago next month at Duke University by Ted Koppel. He was a very popular news anchor on ABC for many years—before most of you graduates were born. Time does not permit me to share most of what he said, but I would like to share parts of his message that are still extremely relevant for all of us today.

&lt;i&gt;We have spent 5,000 years as a race of rational human beings . . . searching for truth and moral absolutes. In the place of Truth we have discovered facts; for moral absolutes we have substituted moral ambiguity. We now communicate with everyone—and say absolutely nothing. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Our society finds Truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form Truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder; it is a howling reproach.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What Moses brought down from Mt. Sinai were not the Ten Suggestions—they are Commandments. &lt;b&gt;Are&lt;/b&gt;, not &lt;b&gt;were.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The sheer brilliance of the Ten Commandments is that they codify, in a handful of words, acceptable human behavior. Not just for then—or now—but for all Time. Language evolves; power shifts from nation to nation; messages are transmitted with the speed of light; Man erases one frontier after another; and yet we and our behavior—and the Commandments which govern that behavior—remain the same.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . What a huge, gaping void there would be in our informational flow and in our entertainment without the routine violation of the Sixth Commandment: “Thou shalt not murder.”&lt;/i&gt;

[And think of how often we now see violations of] &lt;i&gt;the Seventh Commandment: “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”&lt;/i&gt;

Mr. Koppel continued with energy and ­conviction. Said he:

&lt;i&gt;Relevant? Of course the Commandments are ­relevant. Simply because we use different terms and tools, the Eighth Commandment is still relevant to the&lt;/i&gt; [various financial scandals in the world]. &lt;i&gt;The Commandments don’t get bogged down in methodology. Simple and to the point: “Thou shalt not steal.” Watch&lt;/i&gt; [television interviews] &lt;i&gt;and keep the Ninth Commandment in mind: “Thou shalt not bear false witness.” . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When you think about it, it’s curious, isn’t it? We’ve changed in almost all things—where we live, how we eat, communicate, travel—and yet in our moral and immoral behavior we are fundamentally unchanged.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Maimonides and Jesus summed it up in almost identical words: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” So much for our obligations toward our fellow men. That’s what the last five Commandments are all about.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The first five are more complex in that they deal with figures of moral authority. The Fifth Commandment requires us to honor our father and mother. . . . Which brings me to the First and, in this day and age, probably the most controversial of the Commandments, since it requires that we believe in the existence of a single supreme God—and then, in the Second, Third, and Fourth Commandments, &lt;b&gt;prohibits&lt;/b&gt; the worship of any other gods, &lt;b&gt;forbids&lt;/b&gt; that His name be taken in vain,&lt;/i&gt; [and] &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;requires&lt;/b&gt; that we set aside one day in seven to rest and worship Him.&lt;/i&gt; [Ted Koppel, commencement speech at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 10 May 1987, 5–8; emphasis in original]

Well, Ted Koppel said even more than the extensive words that I have just related to you. I was impressed when I first read his talk many years ago after hearing on the news that he had said that the Ten Commandments are not the Ten Suggestions. Even in 1987 it took considerable courage to say what he said on that impressive but largely secular campus. Today, if possible, his words ring even more relevant and important.

As so many of you complete this wonderful phase of your BYU experience, we hope and expect that you will always remember the most important things that you have learned or solidified in your time here. God does live and loves us as the Eternal Father He is. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and His effectuation of the Atonement makes all things possible for those who fully take upon themselves His name, make and keep sacred covenants, and do their very best to keep and obey the commandments. Like Ted Koppel, I remind you that those things of greatest worth are not suggestions but requirements to meet the full potential of a BYU graduate.

I invoke the blessings of heaven upon you, upon your families, and upon all that you do as you go forth to serve, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>It is with considerable pleasure and appreciation that I again voice my welcome to all of you as we honor and commend those being recognized as graduates and honorees in the program of the day. As many of us will emphasize in these exercises today and tomorrow, the achievements we celebrate are not solo acts. That is, virtually no one being honored has been able to reach the heights of accomplishment alone. Therefore we commend spouses, children, parents, friends, mentors, teachers, advisors, and all others who have contributed to the remarkable attainments we acknowledge in these ceremonies.</p>
<p>Today we are especially honored to have as our presiding authority and commencement speaker Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Virtually all here know him well, and we are grateful that he and Sister Perry are with us as two of the most avid and loyal supporters of Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>I hope all of you heard Elder Perry’s general conference address earlier this month. I advise you to read it again in the <i>Ensign</i> in the coming May edition or listen to it again online. I will not say more except to commend it to you and confess that his assessment about the increasing casualness in our society today about the Ten Commandments brought to my mind a favorite commencement address given twenty-six years ago next month at Duke University by Ted Koppel. He was a very popular news anchor on ABC for many years—before most of you graduates were born. Time does not permit me to share most of what he said, but I would like to share parts of his message that are still extremely relevant for all of us today.</p>
<p><i>We have spent 5,000 years as a race of rational human beings . . . searching for truth and moral absolutes. In the place of Truth we have discovered facts; for moral absolutes we have substituted moral ambiguity. We now communicate with everyone—and say absolutely nothing. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Our society finds Truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form Truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder; it is a howling reproach.</i></p>
<p><i>What Moses brought down from Mt. Sinai were not the Ten Suggestions—they are Commandments. <b>Are</b>, not <b>were.</b></i></p>
<p><i>The sheer brilliance of the Ten Commandments is that they codify, in a handful of words, acceptable human behavior. Not just for then—or now—but for all Time. Language evolves; power shifts from nation to nation; messages are transmitted with the speed of light; Man erases one frontier after another; and yet we and our behavior—and the Commandments which govern that behavior—remain the same.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . What a huge, gaping void there would be in our informational flow and in our entertainment without the routine violation of the Sixth Commandment: “Thou shalt not murder.”</i></p>
<p>[And think of how often we now see violations of] <i>the Seventh Commandment: “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”</i></p>
<p>Mr. Koppel continued with energy and ­conviction. Said he:</p>
<p><i>Relevant? Of course the Commandments are ­relevant. Simply because we use different terms and tools, the Eighth Commandment is still relevant to the</i> [various financial scandals in the world]. <i>The Commandments don’t get bogged down in methodology. Simple and to the point: “Thou shalt not steal.” Watch</i> [television interviews] <i>and keep the Ninth Commandment in mind: “Thou shalt not bear false witness.” . . .</i></p>
<p><i>When you think about it, it’s curious, isn’t it? We’ve changed in almost all things—where we live, how we eat, communicate, travel—and yet in our moral and immoral behavior we are fundamentally unchanged.</i></p>
<p><i>Maimonides and Jesus summed it up in almost identical words: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” So much for our obligations toward our fellow men. That’s what the last five Commandments are all about.</i></p>
<p><i>The first five are more complex in that they deal with figures of moral authority. The Fifth Commandment requires us to honor our father and mother. . . . Which brings me to the First and, in this day and age, probably the most controversial of the Commandments, since it requires that we believe in the existence of a single supreme God—and then, in the Second, Third, and Fourth Commandments, <b>prohibits</b> the worship of any other gods, <b>forbids</b> that His name be taken in vain,</i> [and] <i><b>requires</b> that we set aside one day in seven to rest and worship Him.</i> [Ted Koppel, commencement speech at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 10 May 1987, 5–8; emphasis in original]</p>
<p>Well, Ted Koppel said even more than the extensive words that I have just related to you. I was impressed when I first read his talk many years ago after hearing on the news that he had said that the Ten Commandments are not the Ten Suggestions. Even in 1987 it took considerable courage to say what he said on that impressive but largely secular campus. Today, if possible, his words ring even more relevant and important.</p>
<p>As so many of you complete this wonderful phase of your BYU experience, we hope and expect that you will always remember the most important things that you have learned or solidified in your time here. God does live and loves us as the Eternal Father He is. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and His effectuation of the Atonement makes all things possible for those who fully take upon themselves His name, make and keep sacred covenants, and do their very best to keep and obey the commandments. Like Ted Koppel, I remind you that those things of greatest worth are not suggestions but requirements to meet the full potential of a BYU graduate.</p>
<p>I invoke the blessings of heaven upon you, upon your families, and upon all that you do as you go forth to serve, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 25 April 2013.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am definitely humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today. As you can imagine, I have lost a lot of sleep over this responsibility, and I’m guessing that when I am done you will probably say, “He should have slept!”
To begin with, I feel it is important to explain that for most of my life I grew up without a father’s influence in the home, so I turned to the leaders of the Church for guidance. I have read over and over the talks given by the General Authorities and other leaders at general conference and other occasions. Their counsel and instruction have guided me throughout my life as a father would, so I will be using many of their quotes today.
Years ago, when I was a young father, I went downstairs one day to our oldest son’s bedroom. He was very upset and had been crying. I was there to try to comfort him and find out what was wrong. As he and I talked, he confessed that he had told a fib to his mother. He said, “Dad, it’s so hard to be righteous.” This caused me to turn my head and smile, because he was young, but then he continued to say, “Dad, life is like climbing over a wall, isn’t it?” For a moment I was completely stunned. How could he have such insight?
We continued to talk, but the rest of the conversation is a blur. I hope my part of that conversation included teaching him how the Savior made it possible for him to repent of the fib he had told his mother and any other mistakes he had made. I also hope I taught him how very important it is to listen to and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost each day of his life.
In March 1979 President Marion G. Romney, then second counselor in the First Presidency, gave a BYU devotional titled “Guidance of the Holy Spirit.” He stated:
As conditions worsen, it becomes more apparent every day that we are on a collision course with disaster. I am persuaded that nothing short of the guidance of the Holy Spirit can bring us through safely.
He then explained some profound truths. “If you want to obtain and keep the guidance of the Spirit, you can do so by following this simple four-point program”:
1. Pray
2. Study and learn the gospel
3. Live righteously
4. Give service in the Church
President Romney continued: “If you will do these things, you will get the guidance of the Holy Spirit and you will go through this world successfully, regardless of what the people of the world say or do.”1 What a wonderful promise that is!
As I read these words, I recall King Benjamin’s address to the Nephites and their subsequent conversion:
And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My beloved brothers and sisters, I am pleased to be with you to speak about two principles that will give you light throughout your journey through life.
The Great Journey
Like many others, I have followed with interest the landing of an unmanned craft on the planet Mars.
What a remarkable feat!
Since the early 1960s, 35 missions have been launched from Earth to the red planet. Of these, less than one-third have been considered successful (see William Harwood, “Mars Lander Remains Silent,” Washington Post, 27 December 2003, A2). Mars, on average, is roughly 50 million miles away. Can you imagine the challenge of launching a rocket from Earth—a planet that is traveling faster than 66,000 miles per hour itself—having it cross millions of miles of space, and then having it arrive at another planet that is hurtling through space at its own speed of 54,000 miles per hour?
But getting the rover to the planet is only part of the challenge. Landing it safely is another.
Scientists knew the lander would make its descent through the Martian atmosphere at a rate of 12,000 miles per hour. Even after deploying its parachutes, the rover would be going too fast to land safely. So the scientists designed a cocoon of glorified air bags that would surround the rover, cushioning it during impact.
The landing worked beautifully and the rover is now exploring the surface of the red planet, collecting a harvest of images and data that will be studied by students and scientists for years to come.
During my lifetime there have been a number of great voyages that will ever be etched upon the pages of history. When I was a young boy, Charles A. Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean in his Spirit of Saint Louis. When he took off, many throughout the world held their breath, wondering if he would survive. He became a hero of mine, and I remember how we celebrated when news broke that he had landed in Paris.
In another great voyage that took place in the summer of 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped away from the Apollo 11 lunar module. With the words “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,” he set foot upon the moon.
In the last century mankind has taken many great journeys. We have mapped the human genome, made amazing advances in medicine, and reached into the heavens and pulled back answers to riddles that have puzzled mankind for centuries.
We are ever on the threshold of new journeys and new discoveries. Can you imagine the excitement of the Wright brothers on the morning of that first flight? or the anticipation of Jonas Salk as he analyzed the data that demonstrated a way to prevent polio?
Today I look at the youth of our Church and see nearly limitless anticipation. You stand at the very threshold of life!
Who is to say what your lives will hold? What discoveries will you make? What remarkable events will you witness?

		            <span class="card__excerpt">We call this a fireside. I’m not really sure what that means in the Church. But let me use my own interpretation tonight if I may. I would like to talk to you as I would talk to my own family—somewhat informally, but very earnestly. I would like to talk to you tonight about matters I think are of deep concern and I hope of deep interest to you in your lives as you prepare for the future.
Now Is the Time
Let me begin by reminding you that being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a very special privilege. Understanding the basic principles of the plan of salvation and the principles of life that we are to live by here upon the earth is a great blessing. Some of you may need to study the doctrines more diligently so you will know the full significance of the covenants and ordinances of the gospel plan and how it provides for us. Brothers and sisters, it’s wonderful to know of God’s plan to exalt his children. In mortality, separated from our Heavenly Father, we all walk by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We must know his teachings and keep his commandments.
The missionary Amulek had some marvelous instructions on this subject. I read from the writings of Amulek as recorded in chapter 34 of Alma.
Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.
For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.
And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.
Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.
Amulek continues,
For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.
And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Though my name is Japanese, and my roots are from Japan, I was born and reared in Hawaii. We have Elder Yoshihiko Kikuchi from Japan among the General Authorities. He is the real Japanese General Authority, and I am the imitation one.
I recently celebrated my forty-fifth anniversary as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When I was baptized as a young man of seventeen, I did not have a knowledge of the gospel, but I knew for a surety that the Prophet Joseph Smith had seen the Father and the Son in a grove of trees in upstate New York. The missionaries taught me that story, and I gained a testimony of its truthfulness.
There Is a Law
May I share with you tonight my testimony of how the multitude of blessings from our Father in Heaven through his Son Jesus Christ are available to us all as we obey and keep his commandments.
In latter-day revelations we find,
Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.[D&amp;C 130:18–19]
To illustrate this point, I am reminded of an experience in Hawaii while I was serving in a bishopric there. I was assigned to the MIA, and at one time we needed a new president for the YWMIA and a new superintendent for the YMMIA. As we met together to consider who should fill the positions, the bishop asked that we kneel in prayer. He petitioned the Lord, seeking inspiration and revelation for this couple.
After the amen was said, the bishop asked the first counselor if he had any promptings, and he named a serviceman and his wife. The husband was a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood and was not as active as he should be because he had a smoking habit. The bishop asked for my recommendation, and similarly the name of this couple had come very strongly to my mind. The bishop had received the same impression.
We immediately called the couple to the bishop’s office and he stated to the couple that the Lord had called them to be the superintendent and president of the ward MIA. The brother immediately put up his hands and said, “Bishop, thank you for your consideration, but I cannot accept the calling because I have a smoking habit.”
The bishop reminded the brother that the calling was without the cigarette. Then the brother started to tell of his long battle with this habit. For the previous six years he had been trying to overcome this smoking habit. (This was during the Korean War in 1954.) He would abstain from smoking for six months and then would go out on duty aboard ship. In the quiet and lonely hours on deck, he’d be standing in the fantail of the ship, and from the opposite side would come a sailor who would light up a cigarette. That smoke would dr</span>
