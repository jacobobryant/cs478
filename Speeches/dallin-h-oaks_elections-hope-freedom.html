  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am pleased for the opportunity to speak at this BYU devotional. The first BYU devotional I addressed was exactly forty-five years ago, in 1971. That audience included my oldest &lt;i&gt;daughter,&lt;/i&gt; just enrolling as a freshman here. Many years later I spoke at this devotional assembly to an audience that included several of my &lt;i&gt;grandchildren.&lt;/i&gt; Today this audience includes our oldest &lt;i&gt;great-granddaughter,&lt;/i&gt; a sophomore here. Time goes on.

&lt;b&gt;I.&lt;/b&gt;

This opportunity comes at a unique time. I am the only General Authority assigned to address this BYU audience between the beginning of school this fall and the election on November 8. And this audience includes thousands who will soon have their first opportunity to vote. I, therefore, begin by speaking about our national and local elections.

The few months preceding an election have always been times of serious political divisions, but the divisions and meanness we are experiencing in this election, especially at the presidential level, seem to be unusually wide and ugly. Partly this results from modern technology, which expands the audience for conflicts and the speed of dissemination. Today, dubious charges, misrepresentations, and ugly innuendos are instantly flashed around the world, and the effects instantly widen and intensify the gaps between different positions. TV, the Internet, and the emboldened anonymity of the blogosphere have facilitated the current ugliness and have replaced whatever remained of the measured discourse of the past. Nevertheless, as the First Presidency always reminds us, we have the responsibility to become informed about the issues and candidates and to independently exercise our right to vote. Voters, remember, this applies to candidates for the many important local and state offices as well as the contested presidential election.

&lt;b&gt;II.&lt;/b&gt;

We should also remember not to be part of the current meanness. We should communicate about our differences with a minimum of offense. Remember this teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith:

&lt;i&gt;While one portion of the human race&lt;/i&gt; [is] &lt;i&gt;judging and condemning the other without mercy, the great parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; he views them as his offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

I spoke about this subject two years ago in an October general conference talk titled "Loving Others and Living with Differences." My message focused on doctrine and its application to the differences we face in our diverse circumstances in Church and family and in public, but the principles I taught are also relevant to political differences. I said:

&lt;i&gt;We are to live &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; the world but not be &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; the world. We must live in the world because, as Jesus taught in a parable, His kingdom is "like leaven," whose function is to raise the whole mass by its influence (see Luke 13:21; Matthew 13:33; see also 1 Corinthians 5:68). His followers cannot do that if they associate only with those who share their beliefs and practices. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

[The Lord also taught that] &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [3 Nephi 11:29]&lt;i&gt;. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Even as we seek to . . . avoid contention, we must not compromise or dilute our commitment to the truths we understand. We must not surrender our positions or our values. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

[In] &lt;i&gt;public discourse, we should all follow the gospel teachings to love our neighbor and avoid contention. Followers of Christ should be examples of civility. We should love all people, be good listeners, and show concern for their sincere beliefs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Today, I say that if the Church or its doctrines are attacked in blogs and other social media, contentious responses are not helpful. They disappoint our friends and provoke our adversaries.

Finally, as I said two years ago:

&lt;i&gt; When our positions do not prevail, we should accept unfavorable results graciously and practice civility with our adversaries.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;b&gt;III.&lt;/b&gt;

In the distressing circumstances that surround us, we must trust in God and His promises and hold fast to the vital gospel teaching of hope. The prophet Nephi taught that we must "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20). Later, the apostle Paul told the Corinthians:

&lt;i&gt;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Corinthians 4:89]

When we trust in the Lord that all will work out, this hope keeps us moving. Hope is a characteristic Christian virtue. I am glad to practice it and to recommend it to counter all current despairs.

Hope based on trust in the Lord and His promises has sustained me through all the circumstances of my life. For example, when I approached my first enrollment at BYU, sixty-six years ago, the Korean War had just begun. I had just celebrated my eighteenth birthday, and my Utah National Guard field artillery group had just been alerted to join the war in Korea. Two of our battalions had already been mobilized and sent to training locations in the United States. Only the group headquarters here in Provo, to which I belonged, had not yet received its mobilization orders. We were expecting to be sent any day.

As we waited, it came time for freshmen to enroll for the fall quarter at BYU. What should I do? I decided to enroll, pay tuition, start school, and trust in the Lord for whatever happened. If my unit was mobilized, I would leave. If not, I would at least be proceeding forward with my education. Incidentally, the total enrollment at BYU that quarter was only 4,500 students&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and the tuition and fees were only $45.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; As it turned out, our small headquarters group was never mobilized, so I continued and completed my formal education.

Every generation has challenges that can cause discouragement in those without hope. The future is always clouded with uncertainties - wars and depressions being only two examples. While some abandon progress, you of faith should hope on and press on with your education, your lives, and your families.

Some years ago President Thomas S. Monson gave this valuable counsel:

&lt;i&gt;My brothers and sisters, today, as we look at the world around us, we are faced with problems which are serious and of great concern to us. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;My counsel for all of us is to look to the lighthouse of the Lord. There is no fog so dense, no night so dark, no gale so strong, no mariner so lost but what its beacon light can rescue. It beckons through the storms of life. The lighthouse of the Lord sends forth signals readily recognized and never failing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Those words comfort me as I view the terrible conflicts in todays world and the extreme moral and policy divisions that separate different citizens and different aspiring leaders. We all should rely on this assurance in modern revelation: "Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail" (D&amp;amp;C 6:34).

With faith and hope, and with Gods help, we will prevail against our challenges. As Elder Kim B. Clark told your teachers and leaders a few weeks ago, BYU and its values are under attack. We are all being asked to do hard things, for which we need "greater faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," who "will open doors that are closed. He will inspire and guide and provide. He is in charge."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;b&gt;IV.&lt;/b&gt;

I now speak of one of the challenges that face us: the meaning and application of the vital constitutional guarantees that government authority shall make no laws or regulations "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Those rights are fundamental to our constitutional order - not just to protect citizens against repressive government action but also to foster the cherished open society that is the source of our freedom and prosperity. Beyond that, the free exercise of religion is vital because it insures citizens the rights of worship and action that are fundamental to their being.

For many years I have paid close attention to the social and legal trends that are likely to affect the fundamental guarantees that are so vital to fulfill our Churchs mission and to accomplish BYUs educational mission. I am convinced that a worldwide tide is currently running against both religious freedom and its parallel freedoms of speech and assembly.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

I believe religious freedom is declining because faith in God and the pursuit of God-centered religion is declining - worldwide. If one does not value religion, one usually does not put a high value on religious freedom. It is looked at as just another human right, competing with other human rights when it seems to collide with them. I believe the freedoms of speech and assembly are also weakening because many influential persons see them as colliding with competing values now deemed more important. Some extremists have even opposed free speech as an obstacle to achieving their policy goals.

&lt;b&gt;V.&lt;/b&gt;

In our current cultural and political atmosphere, we are distressed to see official and private infringements on free speech, free association, and the free exercise of religion that pose threats to our free and open society. While a political party in power at the federal or state level has greater potential to sponsor official threats, such threats can also be made by others.

Most of the examples I will give are in higher education, but comparable examples could be given in the broader society, including the media, the arts, business, politics, and other areas of culture. I have chosen to concentrate on higher education, since these examples are most appropriate for discussion with a university audience at BYU. Free speech has always been highly valued in education, but open inquiry and communication are currently being replaced on too many campuses by a culture of intellectual conformity and the silencing or intimidation of opposition. This culture even includes formal or informal punishment of those with political views not currently in favor.

As I provide my list of examples, I invite you to augment or challenge these with observations of your own. Weigh the whole and reach your own conclusions. As you do, note the close relationship between the free exercise of religion and the associated rights of free speech and freedom of assembly.

1. Earlier this year a group in the California legislature sought to deny state funding to students of private colleges and universities that rely on religious exemptions from Title IX non-discrimination requirements. Fortunately that effort was blocked, but it will return next year.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Title IX is the same federal statute that was sought to be used to force BYU to have coed dorms when I was president forty years ago.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; BYU prevailed in that earlier contest, but in todays political climate, such attempts to override the freedoms of religious colleges seem certain to continue.

2. A more common and more personal challenge to free speech in current policy debates is the labeling of opposition arguments as "hate speech" or "bigotry." This kind of name-calling chills free speech by seeking to penalize the speech of opponents - personally, socially, or professionally. A legal scholars recent book, which advocates pluralism, mutual respect, and coexistence, states that the label "bigot" is a "conversation stopper" because it "attributes a particular [negative] motive to an action."&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; The author observed that this kind of labeling "frequently appears against religious believers and groups that maintain traditional beliefs about sexuality in their internal membership requirements."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Incidentally, my dictionary defines &lt;i&gt;bigot&lt;/i&gt; as "a person who is utterly intolerant of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from his own."&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Who fits that description in this contest of motives and opinions?

3. Of greater concern are the institutionalized "free speech zones" established by some universities to provide a small designated space in which students may speak freely. The rest of the campus is then a restricted speech zone, in which certain words and ideas (including what are called "microaggressions") are not to be spoken.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Such general restrictions on campus speech seem unlikely to survive their current legal challenges. Academic freedom should not be limited to those who agree with prevailing political views. But the fact that some educators have succumbed to pressures to create such restrictions is worrisome.

4. Free speech and association are also chilled when campus pressures result in administrations canceling commencement speaking invitations or honors to persons whose prior actions or words are being attacked by faculty or students. Although institutions of course exercise judgment about whom to honor or invite, once invitations are extended, they should not be canceled just because a segment of campus is hostile to the honorees or speakers political views.

5. Consider another action of some state institutions. Students seeking official campus status for some religious, social, or political clubs have been told that they must not have any limitations on their membership or leadership. Campus organizations must "take all comers" and let them seek organizational leadership, even if they oppose the organizations principles and standards.

6. A new and rising right being urged is the right not to be offended in the public square and on campuses. Consider how that alleged "right" would suppress religious teaching and free speech by giving any objector the right to police and control the communications of adversaries. Such a concept would also compromise the mission of universities. On that subject, we cannot doubt the wisdom of Clark Kerr, first chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, and twelfth president of the University of California:

&lt;i&gt;The university is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views. Only in this way can it best serve American democracy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

7. In recent years, some scholars whose work has questioned or opposed majority thinking in their disciplines or contradicted the current dogmas of political correctness have faced dismissal or other academic sanctions or, in any event, have had difficulty having their work published in professional journals. Similarly, colleges and universities - especially religious institutions or those associated with conservative causes - are facing increasing pressures from some professional associations and accrediting bodies to conform. Less visible are the many reports of hiring decisions that discriminate against persons who hold or are presumed to hold unpopular views. These examples of discrimination to defend prevailing positions are almost impossible to prove, but their effect - evident in the faculty composition and in the hiring decisions of various academic departments and other organizations - makes them obvious to the critical eye.

8. Finally, I cannot refrain from citing the tactics of public shaming, boycotts, and other actions to punish opponents and intimidate further opposition. Such tactics, which our Church and its California members experienced during and after the Proposition 8 same-gender marriage referendum, obviously poison the atmosphere for open discussion and inquiry. Although often invoking the popular rhetoric of equality and rights, those who employ these tactics erode the vital protections of freedom of thought, speech, religion, and assembly and diminish our countrys beacon light of freedom to the world.

&lt;b&gt;VI.&lt;/b&gt;

We are fortunate that there are leaders whose examples and words promote the values of freedom. Two years ago the leadership of the University of Chicago noted "recent events nationwide that have tested institutional commitments to free and open discourse." They established a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, whose report has now been influential with other senior institutions. That report gave expression to such traditional ideas as these:

&lt;i&gt;It is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;offensive. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt; . . . The Universitys fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;

That report of course acknowledged that the university may restrict certain kinds of expressions, such as those that are illegal, defamatory, threatening, or harassment. Significantly, it also recognized restrictions on speech "that is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of the University."&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

As some universities continue to cave in to pressures for prohibition and academic censorship, I fervently hope that most will follow the principles stated in that persuasive Chicago report.

&lt;b&gt;VII.&lt;/b&gt;

Some of you are wondering whether I will speak of how my concerns for freedom in higher education apply to BYU. I have obviously pondered deeply on that subject, especially during the nineteen years of my service in important positions of academic leadership, first at the University of Chicago and then at BYU. The similarities between those two great universities are far larger than their differences, but there are differences, which I will describe.

Both are private universities. Both must be free to pursue their separate declarations of mission and purpose and to define and advocate the freedom necessary to achieve them. Both are vital contributors to the valuable but threatened diversity of higher education in America.

The differences are rooted in BYUs unique religious mission and the method of learning inherent in it. As stated in BYUs official policy on academic freedom, dated more than twenty-three years ago, "The BYU community embraces traditional freedoms of study, inquiry, and debate, together with the special responsibilities implicit in the universitys religious mission."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Those special responsibilities include some limits on academic freedom. Limitations are common to all universities, as the Chicago report conceded, but BYUs limitations are express and well publicized. Its policy states:

&lt;i&gt;BYU defines itself as having a unique religious mission and as pursuing knowledge in a climate of belief. This model of education differs clearly and consciously from public university models that embody a separation of church and state. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Religion offers venerable alternative theories of knowledge by presupposing that truth is eternal, that it is only partly knowable through reason alone, and that human reason must be tested against divine revelation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

In that context, BYU students commit to a code of honor that prohibits speech that is dishonest, illegal, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others. The limitations on faculty expression apply to expression that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;seriously and adversely&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; affects the university mission or the Church. . . . Examples would include expression with students or in public that:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;  contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; &lt;/i&gt;[or]

&lt;i&gt;  deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

Consider those limitations, which are closely related to BYUs declared method of learning, and I believe you will conclude that BYUs Academic Freedom Policy is correct when it says that "individual freedom of expression is broad, presumptive, and essentially unrestrained except"&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; for these narrow limits. Indeed, in many ways, academic freedom at BYU exceeds that at many colleges and universities that pretend to have unqualified academic freedom and then apply or submit to the kinds of exceptions I described earlier.

BYUs policy concludes with this important affirmation:

&lt;i&gt;For those who embrace the gospel, BYU offers a far richer and more complete kind of academic freedom than is possible in secular universities because to seek knowledge in the light of revealed truth&lt;/i&gt; [and I would add &lt;b&gt;by the methods of revealed truth&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;is, for believers, to be free indeed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;b&gt;VIII.&lt;/b&gt;

And so I have spoken of elections, hope, and freedom. In these distressing times our freedom and hope can best be fostered by five actions:

1. We must concentrate on what we have in common with our neighbors and fellow citizens.

2. We must strive for mutual understanding and treat all with goodwill.

3. We must exercise patience.

4. We should all speak out for religion and the importance of religious freedom.

5. We must, above all, trust in God and His promises.

I testify of the reality of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and of the promise expressed by His servant Mormon, who said:

&lt;i&gt;And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.&lt;/i&gt; [Moroni 7:41]

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I am pleased for the opportunity to speak at this BYU devotional. The first BYU devotional I addressed was exactly forty-five years ago, in 1971. That audience included my oldest <i>daughter,</i> just enrolling as a freshman here. Many years later I spoke at this devotional assembly to an audience that included several of my <i>grandchildren.</i> Today this audience includes our oldest <i>great-granddaughter,</i> a sophomore here. Time goes on.</p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>This opportunity comes at a unique time. I am the only General Authority assigned to address this BYU audience between the beginning of school this fall and the election on November 8. And this audience includes thousands who will soon have their first opportunity to vote. I, therefore, begin by speaking about our national and local elections.</p>
<p>The few months preceding an election have always been times of serious political divisions, but the divisions and meanness we are experiencing in this election, especially at the presidential level, seem to be unusually wide and ugly. Partly this results from modern technology, which expands the audience for conflicts and the speed of dissemination. Today, dubious charges, misrepresentations, and ugly innuendos are instantly flashed around the world, and the effects instantly widen and intensify the gaps between different positions. TV, the Internet, and the emboldened anonymity of the blogosphere have facilitated the current ugliness and have replaced whatever remained of the measured discourse of the past. Nevertheless, as the First Presidency always reminds us, we have the responsibility to become informed about the issues and candidates and to independently exercise our right to vote. Voters, remember, this applies to candidates for the many important local and state offices as well as the contested presidential election.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>We should also remember not to be part of the current meanness. We should communicate about our differences with a minimum of offense. Remember this teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith:</p>
<p><i>While one portion of the human race</i> [is] <i>judging and condemning the other without mercy, the great parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; he views them as his offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I spoke about this subject two years ago in an October general conference talk titled "Loving Others and Living with Differences." My message focused on doctrine and its application to the differences we face in our diverse circumstances in Church and family and in public, but the principles I taught are also relevant to political differences. I said:</p>
<p><i>We are to live </i><b><i>in</i></b><i> the world but not be </i><b><i>of</i></b><i> the world. We must live in the world because, as Jesus taught in a parable, His kingdom is "like leaven," whose function is to raise the whole mass by its influence (see Luke 13:21; Matthew 13:33; see also 1 Corinthians 5:68). His followers cannot do that if they associate only with those who share their beliefs and practices. . . .</i></p>
<p>[The Lord also taught that] <b><i>"he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another"</i></b> [3 Nephi 11:29]<i>. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Even as we seek to . . . avoid contention, we must not compromise or dilute our commitment to the truths we understand. We must not surrender our positions or our values. . . .</i></p>
<p>[In] <i>public discourse, we should all follow the gospel teachings to love our neighbor and avoid contention. Followers of Christ should be examples of civility. We should love all people, be good listeners, and show concern for their sincere beliefs.</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Today, I say that if the Church or its doctrines are attacked in blogs and other social media, contentious responses are not helpful. They disappoint our friends and provoke our adversaries.</p>
<p>Finally, as I said two years ago:</p>
<p><i> When our positions do not prevail, we should accept unfavorable results graciously and practice civility with our adversaries.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>In the distressing circumstances that surround us, we must trust in God and His promises and hold fast to the vital gospel teaching of hope. The prophet Nephi taught that we must "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20). Later, the apostle Paul told the Corinthians:</p>
<p><i>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</i></p>
<p><i>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</i> [2 Corinthians 4:89]</p>
<p>When we trust in the Lord that all will work out, this hope keeps us moving. Hope is a characteristic Christian virtue. I am glad to practice it and to recommend it to counter all current despairs.</p>
<p>Hope based on trust in the Lord and His promises has sustained me through all the circumstances of my life. For example, when I approached my first enrollment at BYU, sixty-six years ago, the Korean War had just begun. I had just celebrated my eighteenth birthday, and my Utah National Guard field artillery group had just been alerted to join the war in Korea. Two of our battalions had already been mobilized and sent to training locations in the United States. Only the group headquarters here in Provo, to which I belonged, had not yet received its mobilization orders. We were expecting to be sent any day.</p>
<p>As we waited, it came time for freshmen to enroll for the fall quarter at BYU. What should I do? I decided to enroll, pay tuition, start school, and trust in the Lord for whatever happened. If my unit was mobilized, I would leave. If not, I would at least be proceeding forward with my education. Incidentally, the total enrollment at BYU that quarter was only 4,500 students<sup>4</sup> and the tuition and fees were only $45.<sup>5</sup> As it turned out, our small headquarters group was never mobilized, so I continued and completed my formal education.</p>
<p>Every generation has challenges that can cause discouragement in those without hope. The future is always clouded with uncertainties - wars and depressions being only two examples. While some abandon progress, you of faith should hope on and press on with your education, your lives, and your families.</p>
<p>Some years ago President Thomas S. Monson gave this valuable counsel:</p>
<p><i>My brothers and sisters, today, as we look at the world around us, we are faced with problems which are serious and of great concern to us. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>My counsel for all of us is to look to the lighthouse of the Lord. There is no fog so dense, no night so dark, no gale so strong, no mariner so lost but what its beacon light can rescue. It beckons through the storms of life. The lighthouse of the Lord sends forth signals readily recognized and never failing.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Those words comfort me as I view the terrible conflicts in todays world and the extreme moral and policy divisions that separate different citizens and different aspiring leaders. We all should rely on this assurance in modern revelation: "Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail" (D&amp;C 6:34).</p>
<p>With faith and hope, and with Gods help, we will prevail against our challenges. As Elder Kim B. Clark told your teachers and leaders a few weeks ago, BYU and its values are under attack. We are all being asked to do hard things, for which we need "greater faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," who "will open doors that are closed. He will inspire and guide and provide. He is in charge."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>I now speak of one of the challenges that face us: the meaning and application of the vital constitutional guarantees that government authority shall make no laws or regulations "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble."<sup>8</sup> Those rights are fundamental to our constitutional order - not just to protect citizens against repressive government action but also to foster the cherished open society that is the source of our freedom and prosperity. Beyond that, the free exercise of religion is vital because it insures citizens the rights of worship and action that are fundamental to their being.</p>
<p>For many years I have paid close attention to the social and legal trends that are likely to affect the fundamental guarantees that are so vital to fulfill our Churchs mission and to accomplish BYUs educational mission. I am convinced that a worldwide tide is currently running against both religious freedom and its parallel freedoms of speech and assembly.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>I believe religious freedom is declining because faith in God and the pursuit of God-centered religion is declining - worldwide. If one does not value religion, one usually does not put a high value on religious freedom. It is looked at as just another human right, competing with other human rights when it seems to collide with them. I believe the freedoms of speech and assembly are also weakening because many influential persons see them as colliding with competing values now deemed more important. Some extremists have even opposed free speech as an obstacle to achieving their policy goals.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>In our current cultural and political atmosphere, we are distressed to see official and private infringements on free speech, free association, and the free exercise of religion that pose threats to our free and open society. While a political party in power at the federal or state level has greater potential to sponsor official threats, such threats can also be made by others.</p>
<p>Most of the examples I will give are in higher education, but comparable examples could be given in the broader society, including the media, the arts, business, politics, and other areas of culture. I have chosen to concentrate on higher education, since these examples are most appropriate for discussion with a university audience at BYU. Free speech has always been highly valued in education, but open inquiry and communication are currently being replaced on too many campuses by a culture of intellectual conformity and the silencing or intimidation of opposition. This culture even includes formal or informal punishment of those with political views not currently in favor.</p>
<p>As I provide my list of examples, I invite you to augment or challenge these with observations of your own. Weigh the whole and reach your own conclusions. As you do, note the close relationship between the free exercise of religion and the associated rights of free speech and freedom of assembly.</p>
<p>1. Earlier this year a group in the California legislature sought to deny state funding to students of private colleges and universities that rely on religious exemptions from Title IX non-discrimination requirements. Fortunately that effort was blocked, but it will return next year.<sup>10</sup> Title IX is the same federal statute that was sought to be used to force BYU to have coed dorms when I was president forty years ago.<sup>11</sup> BYU prevailed in that earlier contest, but in todays political climate, such attempts to override the freedoms of religious colleges seem certain to continue.</p>
<p>2. A more common and more personal challenge to free speech in current policy debates is the labeling of opposition arguments as "hate speech" or "bigotry." This kind of name-calling chills free speech by seeking to penalize the speech of opponents - personally, socially, or professionally. A legal scholars recent book, which advocates pluralism, mutual respect, and coexistence, states that the label "bigot" is a "conversation stopper" because it "attributes a particular [negative] motive to an action."<sup>12</sup> The author observed that this kind of labeling "frequently appears against religious believers and groups that maintain traditional beliefs about sexuality in their internal membership requirements."<sup>13</sup> Incidentally, my dictionary defines <i>bigot</i> as "a person who is utterly intolerant of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from his own."<sup>14</sup> Who fits that description in this contest of motives and opinions?</p>
<p>3. Of greater concern are the institutionalized "free speech zones" established by some universities to provide a small designated space in which students may speak freely. The rest of the campus is then a restricted speech zone, in which certain words and ideas (including what are called "microaggressions") are not to be spoken.<sup>15</sup> Such general restrictions on campus speech seem unlikely to survive their current legal challenges. Academic freedom should not be limited to those who agree with prevailing political views. But the fact that some educators have succumbed to pressures to create such restrictions is worrisome.</p>
<p>4. Free speech and association are also chilled when campus pressures result in administrations canceling commencement speaking invitations or honors to persons whose prior actions or words are being attacked by faculty or students. Although institutions of course exercise judgment about whom to honor or invite, once invitations are extended, they should not be canceled just because a segment of campus is hostile to the honorees or speakers political views.</p>
<p>5. Consider another action of some state institutions. Students seeking official campus status for some religious, social, or political clubs have been told that they must not have any limitations on their membership or leadership. Campus organizations must "take all comers" and let them seek organizational leadership, even if they oppose the organizations principles and standards.</p>
<p>6. A new and rising right being urged is the right not to be offended in the public square and on campuses. Consider how that alleged "right" would suppress religious teaching and free speech by giving any objector the right to police and control the communications of adversaries. Such a concept would also compromise the mission of universities. On that subject, we cannot doubt the wisdom of Clark Kerr, first chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, and twelfth president of the University of California:</p>
<p><i>The university is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views. Only in this way can it best serve American democracy.</i><sup>16</sup></p>
<p>7. In recent years, some scholars whose work has questioned or opposed majority thinking in their disciplines or contradicted the current dogmas of political correctness have faced dismissal or other academic sanctions or, in any event, have had difficulty having their work published in professional journals. Similarly, colleges and universities - especially religious institutions or those associated with conservative causes - are facing increasing pressures from some professional associations and accrediting bodies to conform. Less visible are the many reports of hiring decisions that discriminate against persons who hold or are presumed to hold unpopular views. These examples of discrimination to defend prevailing positions are almost impossible to prove, but their effect - evident in the faculty composition and in the hiring decisions of various academic departments and other organizations - makes them obvious to the critical eye.</p>
<p>8. Finally, I cannot refrain from citing the tactics of public shaming, boycotts, and other actions to punish opponents and intimidate further opposition. Such tactics, which our Church and its California members experienced during and after the Proposition 8 same-gender marriage referendum, obviously poison the atmosphere for open discussion and inquiry. Although often invoking the popular rhetoric of equality and rights, those who employ these tactics erode the vital protections of freedom of thought, speech, religion, and assembly and diminish our countrys beacon light of freedom to the world.</p>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>We are fortunate that there are leaders whose examples and words promote the values of freedom. Two years ago the leadership of the University of Chicago noted "recent events nationwide that have tested institutional commitments to free and open discourse." They established a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, whose report has now been influential with other senior institutions. That report gave expression to such traditional ideas as these:</p>
<p><i>It is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply </i><i>offensive. . . .</i></p>
<p><i> . . . The Universitys fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves.</i><sup>17</sup></p>
<p>That report of course acknowledged that the university may restrict certain kinds of expressions, such as those that are illegal, defamatory, threatening, or harassment. Significantly, it also recognized restrictions on speech "that is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of the University."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>As some universities continue to cave in to pressures for prohibition and academic censorship, I fervently hope that most will follow the principles stated in that persuasive Chicago report.</p>
<p><b>VII.</b></p>
<p>Some of you are wondering whether I will speak of how my concerns for freedom in higher education apply to BYU. I have obviously pondered deeply on that subject, especially during the nineteen years of my service in important positions of academic leadership, first at the University of Chicago and then at BYU. The similarities between those two great universities are far larger than their differences, but there are differences, which I will describe.</p>
<p>Both are private universities. Both must be free to pursue their separate declarations of mission and purpose and to define and advocate the freedom necessary to achieve them. Both are vital contributors to the valuable but threatened diversity of higher education in America.</p>
<p>The differences are rooted in BYUs unique religious mission and the method of learning inherent in it. As stated in BYUs official policy on academic freedom, dated more than twenty-three years ago, "The BYU community embraces traditional freedoms of study, inquiry, and debate, together with the special responsibilities implicit in the universitys religious mission."<sup>19</sup> Those special responsibilities include some limits on academic freedom. Limitations are common to all universities, as the Chicago report conceded, but BYUs limitations are express and well publicized. Its policy states:</p>
<p><i>BYU defines itself as having a unique religious mission and as pursuing knowledge in a climate of belief. This model of education differs clearly and consciously from public university models that embody a separation of church and state. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Religion offers venerable alternative theories of knowledge by presupposing that truth is eternal, that it is only partly knowable through reason alone, and that human reason must be tested against divine revelation.</i><sup>20</sup></p>
<p>In that context, BYU students commit to a code of honor that prohibits speech that is dishonest, illegal, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others. The limitations on faculty expression apply to expression that <b><i>seriously and adversely</i></b><i> affects the university mission or the Church. . . . Examples would include expression with students or in public that:</i></p>
<p><i>  contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; </i>[or]</p>
<p><i>  deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders.</i><sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Consider those limitations, which are closely related to BYUs declared method of learning, and I believe you will conclude that BYUs Academic Freedom Policy is correct when it says that "individual freedom of expression is broad, presumptive, and essentially unrestrained except"<sup>22</sup> for these narrow limits. Indeed, in many ways, academic freedom at BYU exceeds that at many colleges and universities that pretend to have unqualified academic freedom and then apply or submit to the kinds of exceptions I described earlier.</p>
<p>BYUs policy concludes with this important affirmation:</p>
<p><i>For those who embrace the gospel, BYU offers a far richer and more complete kind of academic freedom than is possible in secular universities because to seek knowledge in the light of revealed truth</i> [and I would add <b>by the methods of revealed truth</b>] <i>is, for believers, to be free indeed.</i><sup>23</sup></p>
<p><b>VIII.</b></p>
<p>And so I have spoken of elections, hope, and freedom. In these distressing times our freedom and hope can best be fostered by five actions:</p>
<p>1. We must concentrate on what we have in common with our neighbors and fellow citizens.</p>
<p>2. We must strive for mutual understanding and treat all with goodwill.</p>
<p>3. We must exercise patience.</p>
<p>4. We should all speak out for religion and the importance of religious freedom.</p>
<p>5. We must, above all, trust in God and His promises.</p>
<p>I testify of the reality of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and of the promise expressed by His servant Mormon, who said:</p>
<p><i>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</i> [Moroni 7:41]</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Thank you for being here today. I pray that we may share some insights that will lift and encourage our spirits and help us in our pursuit of excellence. My message is based on a statement made by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland back in the fall of 1981, when he stated: "The opportunity of a lifetime has to be taken in the lifetime of the opportunity" ("Virtus et Veritas," in BYU 198182 Fireside and Devotional Speeches [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1982], p. 12). This morning let us look at opportunity in light of faith, opposition, and friendly support.
It is an honor to be with you today. When I received the invitation to speak, I thought back on how devotionals have been an important part of my life for more than thirty years. One of the first devotionals I remember was when I was a freshman at the school formerly known as Ricks College. I was raised in a faithful LDS home, and my patriarchal blessing said that I was blessed with a testimony through my earthly parents, which was true. But I was determined to strengthen my personal testimony of the restored gospel before serving a full-time mission.
At age eighteen I also had another gospel-related concern. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, and most of my friends, neighbors, teachers, and coaches were not members of the Church. Using my developing powers of observation, I noticed that many of these people seemed to be happy, and many were interesting characters with a healthy sense of humor. My concern was that, up to that time in my life, my limited observations of senior Church leaders suggested that they were quite formal and proper. As a young man I had this nagging question: Would the highest degree of glory in heaven be a very nice but humorless place?
The devotional speaker in January 1982 was the oldest living apostle, ninety-five-year-old LeGrand Richards. Elder Richards was seven years old in 1893 and in attendance when President Wilford Woodruff dedicated the Salt Lake Temple.
Elder Richards rarely delivered a message from a written text. He spoke from his heart, drawing upon a lifetime of experience, study, and inspiration. Id like to share a minute of his remarks so that you can get a sense of Elder LeGrand Richards. At this point in his message he is talking about a Sunday School conference he attended as a boy. The conference was taught by Brothers Karl G. Maeser and George Goddard of the general Sunday School presidency.
I can remember to this day - and it has been over 80 years - the songs Brother Goddard taught us to sing in that Sunday School conference. And when I didnt know I couldnt sing, I tried to sing with them. I dont do it anymore.
The first song goes like this: "Take away the whiskey, the coffee, and the tea. Cold water is the drink for me." And then it repeats and goes on. That made such an impression on me as a boy that Ive hardly been </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">President and Sister Uchtdorf, Elder Cardon, President and Sister Samuelson, all of the other distinguished Brethren from Salt Lake, all of the faculty and staff, students, friends, and family: There are some of you who will remember the classic childrens story Winnie-the-Pooh. As you recall, Pooh had a very unique way of going down stairs. He would go bump, bump, bump, bump down the stairs on the back of his head.
According to one telling of the story, one day Christopher Robin asked Pooh why he always went down stairs on the back of his head when it must really hurt.
Poohs response was classic. He said that he didnt know why and that he had been going down stairs that way for so long that he didnt know there was any other way to do it. (See The Positive Project, "Bump, bump, bump . . . ," thinkpositivetoday.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/bump-bump-bump; see also chapter 1, A. A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh [1926].)
Once Pooh realizes that he can make the decision to do it another way, he will find that he can go down stairs like everyone else. How many of us are like Pooh Bear? We get so stuck in a rut with the things we do and the decisions we make that we dont realize that there are other alternatives from which we can choose. This is how some of our habits form.
Most decisions we make are simple day-to-day decisions (e.g., what time we are going to get up, where we are going to go today, what entree we are going to order from the menu). Other decisions get a little bit more complicated (e.g., what courses I will take, what job I will take, where I will live). And other decisions really require a lot of thought (e.g., whom I shall marry, what I need to do to retain the Spirit in my life, how I will demonstrate my love for the Savior). We are making these decisions every day of our lives, and we will yet make thousands more.
You have made one of the key decisions of your life: to work hard enough to graduate from one of the worlds great institutions. Do you realize what that will mean to you? It doesnt mean that you simply survived. You have actually succeeded in accomplishing that for which you will be forever grateful. It doesnt matter whether you go on to work in the Church, at home, in your community, or in the workplace. You have made decisions and have taken the responsibility to succeed at something only a handful of people have ever done. In very deed you have prepared yourself for a life of service and continued learning by finding added meaning in your life through those experiences you have had here at BYU. The significance of that will unfold as the years pass.
Whatever your decisions, what I hope for you and what I pray for is that you will make the Lord a key part of those decisions, whether they are great or small. I also hope you will remember a little saying that has guided me for years. It goes something like this:
You are what you do;

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I wish to thank President Samuelson, Academic Vice President Tanner, and Advancement Vice President Worthen for the opportunity to speak today. I am grateful for these devotionals and the occasion they give us to explore what it means to be a community of faith as well as a community of reason. I want to express my gratitude for the beautiful music and to Megan Grant and Suzanne Disparte for their prayers. They are two of my research assistants who prop me up on a daily basis; so it is entirely fitting that they do the same thing here. I want to also acknowledge my father and stepmother; my wife, Deirdre; and my three children, Elliot, Sophelia, and Ella. They are missing school to be here, so I know I have a grateful audience of at least three.
As I prepared to speak with you today, I actually worked through three different topics, each more personal than the last, and I hope you will forgive me as I speak from the heart about some aspects of my own journey of faith.
I traveled in my minds eye back to my student days. At Oxford University I attended a series of lectures in which a famous and fashionable professor asserted confidently that the study of ancient Greek philosophy was one of the three best things in life. With a sly smile and an arched eyebrow, he did not tell us out loud what he thought the other two were.
But his assertion left me wondering: What are the most important three things in the world? Later, during my personal scripture study, I searched the Topical Guide for inspiration and was led to Pauls famous formulation in 1 Corinthians:
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. . . .
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.1
At the very end of the Book of Mormon, after completing his abridgement of the Jaredite record, the prophet Moroni is surprised to find that he is not dead yet.2 Fortunately, he catches a second wind and recounts a few of his fathers teachings, including Mormons powerful discourse on faith, hope, and charity.3 And then, in Moroni 10, the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, Moroni returns to this theme as he offers his final exhortations. (By my count, in that chapter alone he uses the words exhortation or exhort nine times.) Moroni says:
And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every good gift cometh of Christ. . . . 
Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.
And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful to be with you today. I know that I am in the presence of a most outstanding group of young people - you who are earnestly striving to achieve in both your spiritual and temporal lives. As I look into your faces, I see goodness, optimism, determination, and hope for the future. I am particularly grateful to be with you at such an important time when you are preparing for your life that will shortly go beyond the safety and sanctuary of school - a life that some of you may see as bleak and concerning and that others will see as full of excitement and opportunity. As I pondered and prayed about what I might say to you today, I could not dismiss the promptings to talk to you about what lies ahead as you move into the world that you will soon become a part of. I pray for the Lords inspiration as I visit with you. I begin by relating a personal experience.
Some 30 years ago I was working for a corporation headquartered in the United States that had international operations. We had recently hired a Jewish man to run our European businesses. It was known by many in the corporation that as a young boy he had been torn from the safety and the love of his family and thrust into a Nazi concentration camp for the duration of World War II. Since he and I shared some responsibilities for our European operations, we occasionally traveled to Europe together. On one such trip, after we had become well acquainted and I felt it not inappropriate, I inquired about his terrible experiences during those several years of his life.
As I remember the details, he told me that when he was five years old, his father, mother, and older sister had already been taken by the Gestapo. He and his grandmother were traveling by train to find refuge when the Gestapo boarded and searched the train. He and his grandmother were discovered and taken separate ways, and he never again saw his grandmother. In fact, he never again saw any of his family members.
It is not my intent to describe the already known atrocities that occurred to those so confined but to relate a lesson my co-worker taught me while enduring those terrible years. As he concluded recounting his experiences, and after several minutes of contemplative silence, he then asked me this question: "Do you know what the most powerful force in the world is?"
Without hesitation I answered, "Love. Love conquers all. If only your persecutors had love for you and for their fellow man, you would not have suffered as you did."
He responded, "No, it is not love. All those years I was in the concentration camp, I had love. I had love for my mother, father, and sister. I had love for my grandmother. But that love did not sustain me. It did not keep me alive." And then he said, "Hope. Hope is the most powerful force. It was hope that kept me alive. It was hope that I would survive. It was hope for freedom. It was hope that I would someday be reunited with my loved on</span>
