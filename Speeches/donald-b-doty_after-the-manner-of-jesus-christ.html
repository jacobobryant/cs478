  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I express my sincere gratitude and pleasure on receiving the degree of doctor of science and Christian service from Brigham Young University. I am not an alumnus of BYU. As I look back fifty-five years to when I visited the campus for the first time, I wish that I had received my undergraduate education at BYU. As I receive this distinguished degree, I join my wife and our two sons in having a degree from BYU.

I offer a few thoughts to the graduates as you embark on your life prepared by the degree from BYU that you will receive today.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Become a Scholar for Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As I began my studies leading to the degree of doctor of medicine, the dean of the medical school met with the students. He said:

&lt;i&gt;You are graduate students and are expected to learn on your own by your own effort. We will help you learn, but we will not spoon-feed you. We have a library of medicine. I would suggest that you go there, take a book from the shelves, read from it, and learn.&lt;/i&gt;

Today all of this information is available on the Internet, so it is easy to be studying and learning all of your life.

Resolve any conflict that you may have in your mind regarding scientifically based knowledge and knowledge that comes from the gifts of the Spirit. Remember the words of Isaiah:

&lt;i&gt;Whom shall he teach knowledge? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.&lt;/i&gt; [Isaiah 28:9–10]

When one comes to the understanding that all knowledge has its origin with God and is given to man incrementally for the benefit of humankind, there is no conflict between science and gifts of the Spirit. We then qualify to receive new knowledge and recognize it rightfully as a gift from God.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Select Great Mentors and Follow Their Ways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
On the first day of my training to become a heart surgeon with Dr. John W. Kirklin, one of the pioneers of the use of the heart-lung machine, he stated emphatically: “Try to do everything exactly as I do it!” At first I thought him to be arrogant, but as I considered more thoughtfully what he had said, I realized if I were ever to approach his excellence as a cardiac surgeon, it was incumbent upon me to follow his ways as accurately and precisely as possible.

President Russell M. Nelson, then Doctor Nelson, invited me to work with him in the practice of cardiovascular surgery. His environment was one in which honesty and doing what is right were the principles that guided all personal and professional relationships. Intellectual honesty means never leaving anything to chance. Intellectual dishonesty means thinking it will be okay when you know all is not right. Doing what is right means always taking the high road even if it is more difficult and less politically expedient.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find Ways to Provide Christian Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It has been easy for me as a medical doctor to provide service to others in time of need. It has been my responsibility to be available to the sick and afflicted. Illness does not have a calendar or a clock—there are no weekends, and illness frequently attacks late in the night. Medicine as a profession requires that we work when there is a need and stay with it until the problem is resolved.

I have learned that the times I taught and provided my skills as a surgeon without compensation to those living in deprived conditions were the most rewarding experiences of my professional life. Teaching and operating in hospitals in China, Russia, Latvia, and Ukraine not only provided care for people in need but also advanced quality of care provided by the dedicated doctors working and doing their best with what little they had in those hospitals.

It may seem strange for me to speak of the end of a career that you have not even started. The reality is that your productive life working for compensation is limited and the time will pass too soon until you retire to the life of a pensioner. You may then choose a life of full-time play or full-time rest. I would suggest that it is better to prolong your career by continuing to use your talents in service to others.

When I left the rigor of the operating room, I was called to senior missionary service with my wife, Cheryl. We served full-time in the Missionary Department for nine years, organizing and supporting hundreds of volunteer health professionals responsible for the health and safety of more than 83,000 missionaries serving in missions worldwide. It was a second career for me, requiring study and learning in order to advise proper care for afflicted missionaries. I observed the deep concern of the Brethren of the Twelve and the Seventy whenever a missionary was seriously injured or ill. It was a blessing to observe divine intervention saving missionaries when we had done all that we could.

Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, ­provided the ultimate example of service to others. Throughout His ministry, as He went about teaching His gospel, He blessed and healed the sick and afflicted. Interestingly, many of the healing miracles of Jesus Christ were accomplished on the Sabbath. There were many times that I had to work on Sundays, holidays, or other inconvenient times, and I could have used my profession as an excuse not to serve in the Church and for other worthy causes. The blessings that accompany pure Christian service given whenever there is need, however, are so wonderful that any personal sacrifice should be made to receive them. As we serve others after the manner taught by Jesus Christ, we feel His love and focus our lives on becoming more like Him. In His name, Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I express my sincere gratitude and pleasure on receiving the degree of doctor of science and Christian service from Brigham Young University. I am not an alumnus of BYU. As I look back fifty-five years to when I visited the campus for the first time, I wish that I had received my undergraduate education at BYU. As I receive this distinguished degree, I join my wife and our two sons in having a degree from BYU.</p>
<p>I offer a few thoughts to the graduates as you embark on your life prepared by the degree from BYU that you will receive today.</p>
<h2><b>Become a Scholar for Life</b></h2>
<p>As I began my studies leading to the degree of doctor of medicine, the dean of the medical school met with the students. He said:</p>
<p><i>You are graduate students and are expected to learn on your own by your own effort. We will help you learn, but we will not spoon-feed you. We have a library of medicine. I would suggest that you go there, take a book from the shelves, read from it, and learn.</i></p>
<p>Today all of this information is available on the Internet, so it is easy to be studying and learning all of your life.</p>
<p>Resolve any conflict that you may have in your mind regarding scientifically based knowledge and knowledge that comes from the gifts of the Spirit. Remember the words of Isaiah:</p>
<p><i>Whom shall he teach knowledge? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.</i> [Isaiah 28:9–10]</p>
<p>When one comes to the understanding that all knowledge has its origin with God and is given to man incrementally for the benefit of humankind, there is no conflict between science and gifts of the Spirit. We then qualify to receive new knowledge and recognize it rightfully as a gift from God.</p>
<h2><b>Select Great Mentors and Follow Their Ways</b></h2>
<p>On the first day of my training to become a heart surgeon with Dr. John W. Kirklin, one of the pioneers of the use of the heart-lung machine, he stated emphatically: “Try to do everything exactly as I do it!” At first I thought him to be arrogant, but as I considered more thoughtfully what he had said, I realized if I were ever to approach his excellence as a cardiac surgeon, it was incumbent upon me to follow his ways as accurately and precisely as possible.</p>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson, then Doctor Nelson, invited me to work with him in the practice of cardiovascular surgery. His environment was one in which honesty and doing what is right were the principles that guided all personal and professional relationships. Intellectual honesty means never leaving anything to chance. Intellectual dishonesty means thinking it will be okay when you know all is not right. Doing what is right means always taking the high road even if it is more difficult and less politically expedient.</p>
<h2><b>Find Ways to Provide Christian Service</b></h2>
<p>It has been easy for me as a medical doctor to provide service to others in time of need. It has been my responsibility to be available to the sick and afflicted. Illness does not have a calendar or a clock—there are no weekends, and illness frequently attacks late in the night. Medicine as a profession requires that we work when there is a need and stay with it until the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>I have learned that the times I taught and provided my skills as a surgeon without compensation to those living in deprived conditions were the most rewarding experiences of my professional life. Teaching and operating in hospitals in China, Russia, Latvia, and Ukraine not only provided care for people in need but also advanced quality of care provided by the dedicated doctors working and doing their best with what little they had in those hospitals.</p>
<p>It may seem strange for me to speak of the end of a career that you have not even started. The reality is that your productive life working for compensation is limited and the time will pass too soon until you retire to the life of a pensioner. You may then choose a life of full-time play or full-time rest. I would suggest that it is better to prolong your career by continuing to use your talents in service to others.</p>
<p>When I left the rigor of the operating room, I was called to senior missionary service with my wife, Cheryl. We served full-time in the Missionary Department for nine years, organizing and supporting hundreds of volunteer health professionals responsible for the health and safety of more than 83,000 missionaries serving in missions worldwide. It was a second career for me, requiring study and learning in order to advise proper care for afflicted missionaries. I observed the deep concern of the Brethren of the Twelve and the Seventy whenever a missionary was seriously injured or ill. It was a blessing to observe divine intervention saving missionaries when we had done all that we could.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, ­provided the ultimate example of service to others. Throughout His ministry, as He went about teaching His gospel, He blessed and healed the sick and afflicted. Interestingly, many of the healing miracles of Jesus Christ were accomplished on the Sabbath. There were many times that I had to work on Sundays, holidays, or other inconvenient times, and I could have used my profession as an excuse not to serve in the Church and for other worthy causes. The blessings that accompany pure Christian service given whenever there is need, however, are so wonderful that any personal sacrifice should be made to receive them. As we serve others after the manner taught by Jesus Christ, we feel His love and focus our lives on becoming more like Him. In His name, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><i>Donald B. Doty, MD, thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon, received an honorary doctorate when this commencement address was given on 13 August 2015.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I want to think with you today about what it means to be a Christian. And, since, ultimately, what it means to be a Christian is to “be perfect even as [Jesus], or [our] Father who is in heaven is perfect” (3 Nephi 12:48; see Matthew 5:48), I want to think with you about being a Christian perfectly, rather than doing Christianity perfectly. Perfection, we tell ourselves, is a process, but I want to take the Lord at His word, and His word when He issued this command is that we “be perfect” with no additional words of comforting qualification. The word be is an important word in this statement. To be perfect is to be complete, whole—though we mean to lose the self in the service of others so we can find it again. Our modern lives have a way of scattering us into the many sectors of our responsibilities, each with its own list of tasks to be performed, superiors to be satisfied, substances or situations to be avoided, and people to be loved. Something tells me that the wholeness the Lord is talking about is not the sum of the items on these lists, especially because the lists contain so many “to don’ts” as well as “to dos.”
One of the striking things about sin is that it is not an opposite form of completing the self but rather a way of dividing and dislocating a bit of oneself from the whole. We often refer to this phenomenon as compartmentalizing our lives and ourselves. I think that what we might call “Internet sin” is particularly effective in exploiting this vulnerability in us as well as in the world that we usually try to distinguish ourselves from. Certainly pornography, plagiarism, and gambling on the Internet are the problems they are for us because the chance to indulge the powerful temptations that have always been with us is now just a few clicks away. And it doesn’t help us that these temptations often find us, rather than our having to go out and look for them at a store, theater, or party.
But the basic challenge the Internet poses is that it’s more than just an easily accessible storehouse of images and information. The Web, with its many entrances into labyrinths of virtual experience and relationships, makes it easy for a part of oneself to wander off and slip into another room unnoticed by others and barely noticed by the rest of oneself. The appeal of restaging one’s life on another stage where it can enter in and exit from some contained adventure and stimulation is very strong, especially when one constitutes one’s world as a place of denials, deferrals, and dangers, and when envy of others’ worlds of popularity and possessions is inverted into configuring a good world as one that deprives its inhabitants of such things. Is that what we think righteousness is—a life of privation we endure on the promise that we’ll get more and better versions of the stuff and the station we’ve always wanted? If so, is it any wonder that when technology gives us the chance t</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">President and Sister Samuelson, my former colleagues at BYU, and friends, I am honored to speak to you today. Speakers at this podium have changed my life. I feel the burden of responsibility. I am thankful for the prayer and the inspirational music.
You should know that today is significant in the life of our family, not simply because I am speaking here but because it is also the 25th birthday of my son, Robert. Now you may think, “What a parochial thing to bring into a setting like this,” but historians will recognize that 25 years ago today something else very significant happened in the history of BYU. It was 25 years ago today that BYU beat UCLA in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament and Danny Ainge outscored the entire UCLA team in the first half. With hopes that this anniversary is a sign for good things to come for all BYU student athletes, I proceed.
One of the many enjoyable facets of my experience working at BYU was regular interaction with Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, whose responsibilities then included serving as commissioner of the Church Educational System. I remember him saying that he has learned from President Hinckley that we must do better at getting the gospel down into our own hearts and the hearts of those we love and serve. That is a challenge from the prophet. We must constantly ask ourselves how to meet that challenge. Today I offer a suggestion born of my recent experience as president of a BYU stake.
Years ago Elder Boyd K. Packer gave a general conference address titled “The Mediator.” In that address Elder Packer said:
[The Atonement of Christ] is the very root of Christian doctrine. You may know much about the gospel as it branches out from there, but if you only know the branches and those branches do not touch that root, if they have been cut free from that truth, there will be no life nor substance nor redemption in them. [Boyd K. Packer, “The Mediator,” Ensign, May 1977, 56]
I will confess to you that I have participated in—indeed, I have taught—many lessons that, although interesting and motivational, according to Elder Packer’s guide had “no life nor substance nor redemption in them” because they weren’t directly linked to the Atonement of Christ. That’s a serious criticism of much of what we do, and I believe it’s on the mark. I believe that one way—the best way, and possibly the only way—to meet President Hinckley’s challenge to do better at getting the gospel down into our hearts and the hearts of those we love and serve is to focus all we do on the Atonement of Christ. And so, as a newly called stake presidency, we tried to do just that.
We laid down a rule that every sacrament meeting talk and every lesson in Sunday School, Relief Society, and priesthood meetings must be related to the Atonement of Christ in a direct and express way. Our goal was to have all of our meetin</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear President Holland, members of the faculty, and students of this great university of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I appreciate very much the invitation to speak to you today in this devotional hour. As I am not speaking in my native German tongue, I have a sincere prayer in my heart that the things I will say will be understandable to you and that we will be united in the Spirit of the Lord as I am expressing my views.
The other day I was watching a news broadcast on a local TV channel, and I witnessed a minister of one of the Protestant faiths making a blunt statement that Mormons cannot be considered as Christians. As I was pondering about this statement, my thoughts went back into the history of the Christian world and the always new questions: What is truth? Who is qualified or authorized to make judgment? Who is truly representing the Lord and His plan of salvation on this earth?
These questions are obviously of most significance, for the Lord, during His earthly ministry, made the statement, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me? (John 14:6). In His foreknowledge, Christ must have seen what would happen to the coming generations before He would be able to establish His kingdom on this earth, because He gave His disciples the profound warning: “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves” (Matthew 7:15). He then explained how to find and identify His disciples:
Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.
[Matthew 7:16–20]
In light of the fact that some ministers of institutional churches want to deny us the right to be called Christian, I feel it would be appropriate to do some investigation into the history of Christianity to look for some clues for identification of the fruit we should be looking for. May I invite you, therefore, for a short review of history, perhaps not only in an effort to investigate or to identify the fruit we should be looking for, but perhaps in so doing, to also find the roots of the misery that challenges the very existence of mankind in our day.
When we look into the heritage of our Western culture, we find that we cannot separate our political history from the history of the institutional Christian churches. Both are inseparably connected and interwoven, and as we dare to look back and study the facts about the development of the Christian churches and nations over a period of nearly two thousand years, we unders</span>
