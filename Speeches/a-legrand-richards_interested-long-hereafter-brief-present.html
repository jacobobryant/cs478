  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Brothers and sisters, I really feel honored this morning at having been invited to occupy this place, but I feel very humble. I greet all of you students, officers, teachers, wonderful missionaries, and visitors in our midst. We are proud of you and of this great institution, which is one of the important arms of this great Church - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Now, when you were deciding that you wanted to come here to school (and I suppose I am to talk to the students this morning), you, no doubt, studied the catalog issued by the school and found that there are hundreds of subjects in there, so you had to decide which subjects you wanted. After you decided, then you had to work at it, because it wouldnt do you any good if it just stayed in the catalog.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Value of Education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There is a story told about a young man who enrolled at Oberlin College. When the president showed him what he would have to study, he said, "Isnt there a shorter course?"

The president said, "Oh, yes. It just depends on what you want to make of yourself. When the Lord starts out to make an oak tree he takes a hundred years for it, but if he wants to make a squash, he does it in six months." Now, I dont suppose any of you want to be squashes.

There was an educator down in Atlanta, Georgia, while I was president of the mission down there. He has talked in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake at educational meetings, and I heard him relate this little story. He said that when he was a boy his father told him it was time for him to decide what he wanted to be in life and what he wanted to make of himself. So he studied the situation and he thought it would be wonderful to be a minister because he thought of the minister in his community and how the people loved him and how much good he did. So he thought hed like to be a minister. Then he thought of being a doctor, how doctors relieve pain and distress and perform operations and increase the life span of people. And he thought it would be wonderful to be a doctor. Then he thought of being an architect and how wonderful it would be to plan buildings and to know that as they rise to the sky they were the result and product of his own brain. So he thought it would be wonderful to be an architect. Then he thought of being a writer and how writers sway the thoughts of men and of their great influence in the world. So he thought it would be wonderful to be a writer. Then he thought of the beautiful ears of corn that his daddy raised on the farm, and how wonderful it would be to be able to make the earth produce like that. So he thought it would be wonderful to be a farmer. And then, being a prayerful man, he got down on his knees and something seemed to say to him, "Why not be a teacher? Your students will preach your sermons for you; your students will perform your operations for you; your students will build your buildings for you; your students will write your books for you; and your students will raise your corn." So he decided that he would be a teacher.

Some years ago, my wife gave me a copy of one of Wigginss books, called &lt;i&gt;The Marks of an Educated Man.&lt;/i&gt; She knew that I needed it, and she gave it to me for a birthday present. So I read it. There was a little story in there that intrigued me. It told about a college professor from an agricultural college who went into a farming community to try to induce the boys from the farm to attend the college. In that particular locality, there was a farmer, John, who knew all about farming, and he boo-hooed the idea. He said, "Imagine - going to college to learn how to farm. If you want to learn how to farm, get out on the farm." But his son had the idea that he would like to go to college and sold his mother on the idea, so you know what happened. Well, when the boy came back from college, the father said, "Now you take half of the farm, and Ill take the other half, and well see who knows how to farm - the man from the farm or the man from the college."

One morning Father came in and said, "Ma, what are those boxes up in Sons window?"

"Oh," she said, "hes just testing his seed."

"Hmmm, a man who doesnt know seed when he sees it has no business on a farm." When the crop was gathered in, the father had sixty bushels to the acre, and the boy had ninety bushels to the acre. (I didnt think there was any place they raised that much, but I found it up in Idaho.) The next morning after the count was taken, Father came down the steps all dressed in his best bib and tucker, carrying his little traveling bag. Ma said, "Where are you going, Pa?"

He said, "Im going to college."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Advantage of Attending BYU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, you decided that a college education could enrich your lives, could help you to appreciate the finer things in life - literature, art, music, and the lives of great men and women - so it is worth something to spend your time in college. But there are some fringe benefits, too, that I dont know whether all of you young folks here at Brigham Young University appreciate; that is, so many of the students from all over this world have found their lifes companions here at school. In fact, I understand that President Wilkinson found his wife here, President Oaks found his wife here, and I dont know how many more of the faculty have found their companions here. I travel all over the world, and I stay in the homes of stake presidents. You would be surprised how many of them have met their companions here at this institution. It is worth a lot to this Church to know that our young people meet where they have common interests, thoughts, and beliefs so that they can build happy homes.

I was up in Bountiful last Saturday and Sunday to my conference. In the Sunday morning session they had asked a former stake president (who presided over a stake outside of Utah) to offer the opening prayer. I visited with him and said, "Do you remember when I attended a meeting that you were at when Brigham Young University was trying to promote itself in the various sections of the Church and you told the people in that meeting that you had sent eight children to Brigham Young University and all eight of them had found their companions there?"

"I remember that," he said. "Its nine now, instead of eight; we had one more to come." Well, those are the fringe benefits you get from attending this college.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Catalog of Scriptures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, I have another little thought to go with that. You study the catalog and decide what you want to make of yourselves. Theres another catalog, issued by our Father in heaven, called the holy scriptures. It is important that we study that catalog to know what we want to make of ourselves for the long journey. I like this little statement by Cicero: "I am more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present." I like that thinking: "I am more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present." I think each one of you should be more interested in the long hereafter, and thats one reason why you are here at this church institution.

Jesus said, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 6:39). And without our knowledge of him as the creator of the heavens and the earth and of his great atoning sacrifice, we would not be able to accomplish the measure of our creation here upon this earth. Then he said, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Thats what we find listed in the Lords catalog, the holy scriptures. Jesus said, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Mark 8:3637). It is something to think of giving the whole world, isnt it? Jesus called the gospel "the pearl of great price." He said, "A merchantman, seeking goodly pearls: who when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it" (Matthew 13:4546). That is what a testimony, a witness, and an understanding of what the Lords catalog, his holy scriptures, would do for us. They would become the most important things in our lives.

Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I believe that with all my heart, and I believe that lives and homes that are built upon that principle will never fail.

Jesus said:

&lt;i&gt;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. &lt;/i&gt;[Matthew 6:1921]

And so these are some of the things that we read in the Lords catalog to live by.

A writer by the name of Munger said, "Measure not life by the hopes and enjoyments of this world, but by the preparation it makes for another - looking forward to what you shall be, rather than backward to what you have been."

Were told in the Lords catalog of scriptures that when this earth was created, the Lord pointed out the new matter and said:

&lt;i&gt;We will go down . . . and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon, . . . and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.&lt;/i&gt; [Abraham 3:2426]

Now, thats just a little longer than three or four years at college, isnt it?

The Savior said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10). Thats why we need to know whats recorded in his catalog, or in his holy scriptures.

Following the day of Pentecost, Peter preached to those who had put Christ to death. He had such power as he proclaimed the life of the Master and his great atoning sacrifice that we are told they were pricked in their hearts and cried out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them:

&lt;i&gt;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.&lt;/i&gt; [Acts 2:3839]

That promise has never been rescinded. Its there in his catalog. All we have to do is abide it, and then were entitled to the gift of the Spirit. As he said, "The promise is unto all." Jesus also said, "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you" (John 16:7). "He shall take from the Father and from me and reveal it unto you. All things," he said, "we could know by the power of the Holy Ghost, and we can know the truth of all things by that power of the Holy Ghost" (see Moroni 10:5).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sow to the Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Paul said, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Galatians 6:78). In my position in the Church, Ive found some who sowed to the flesh. They come in with their troubles and, I tell you, then I wished I had the power to touch the hearts of every boy and girl in the world to enable them to have enough courage to sow only to the Spirit.

Some years ago I was asked to talk in the state penitentiary. We had a pretty good crowd there; there was nowhere else for them to go. And because of that meeting there was quite a group that came up to visit with me. One was a grandson of one of the Presidents of the Church, one was the grandson of one of the Presiding bishops (not related to me), one had been a ward clerk, one had been a district president in the mission field, and they were there because they had sowed to the flesh. I tell you, my heart went out to them under those conditions. When I was there, I was invited to return again to talk to the Alcoholics Anonymous group. (I made sure I got a round-trip ticket so I could get out once I got in there.) When I came I said, "Id like to hear from you men. How do you feel? What can you tell me?"

And the man in charge of that group stood up and he said, "I thank God for the privilege of being in this institution." Can you imagine? Thats what you get when you sow to the flesh. He thanked God for the privilege of being in that state penitentiary. He said, "Before I came here, I was no good to my family, I was no good to my country, I was no good to my church. I was just no good, period. Now, I have hopes that when I get out of here Ill be worth something to somebody." Thats what it means to sow to the Spirit.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Missionary Work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the great promises of the Lord is in connection with missionary work. (We have some young men here preparing to go into the mission field.) Personally, I wouldnt want to raise a boy and then not have him go on a mission. I feel this way for his good and because we owe it to the world to share the wonderful truths of the gospel. Nephi of old saw our day. He saw the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. He saw the establishment of the Lords latter-day kingdom. He saw the Saints of God gathered upon the face of the whole earth and the power of God resting upon them in great glory. Then he said:

&lt;i&gt;Blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 13:37]

"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings" (Mosiah 15:18). What a promise! How could this work fill the whole earth except for the great missionary program of the Church?

I was interested in a little story that Brother Benson told us the other day. He was back East attending a convention, and he attended a banquet where he sat next to a minister. The minister turned to him and said, "Mr. Benson, Id like to talk to you after the banquet." They went to the other end of the banquet hall, and the minister said, "There are two things in your church we would like to copy."

Brother Benson said, "What are they?"

He said, "The first is your missionary program. You send your missionaries all over the world, they pay their way to their field of labor, they maintain themselves while theyre there, and then, out of the church funds, you pay their fare home if theyve been good missionaries. Now, we have a missionary fund in our church, and we offer to pay their way to their mission field, maintain them while theyre there and pay their way back, but we cant get anybody to go."

I talk to the missionaries in the mission home every Tuesday afternoon. We always have between two and three hundred there. As I see those fine-looking men, I say to myself, "Talk about the miracles of ancient days! This is a miracle every day." I see them coming from all over the Church. Nobody but God the Eternal Father can put into their hearts the willingness to serve as they have, and we have over eighteen thousand missionaries in the mission field today. Now President Kimball is asking us to lengthen our stride. He thinks we ought to have double that many, and I think we will in just a very short time because of this call that comes to us from the Lord. You know we sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days." President Grant used to say about that, "Some of the Saints would like to put a P.S. on it: provided the prophet doesnt ask us to do something we dont want to do."

In the early days of the Church, when the brethren joined the Church they would inquire of the Lord what thing they could do that would be most pleasing unto him. The answer would come back that they were to thrust in their sickles and reap because the harvest was white, all ready to be garnered (see D&amp;amp;C 4:4). Then he adds:

&lt;i&gt;If it be so that you should labor all your days . . . and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me . . . how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 18:1516]

Now, I went on my first mission (I have been on four missions) seventy years ago this coming April, and I count the families that Ive been instrumental in bringing into this Church. I wouldnt sell them out of the Church for all the money in this world. Talk about the fact that their joy shall be great in the kingdom of my father: by the dozens and the hundreds today, these converts and their children almost worship me because of what I brought to them.

I remember one little story that President Grant used to tell that Id like to tell you in closing. He told about a Scandinavian couple who came over in the early days of the Church. They hadnt been taught much about the gospel, so all they knew was that it was true. The bishop went to this family and taught them the law of tithing. The man paid his tithing. Then the bishop went and taught them about fast offerings. He paid his fast offerings. Then the bishop went to him later to get a donation to help build the meetinghouse. He thought that ought to come out of the tithing, but before the bishop got through with him he paid his donations for the meetinghouse. Then the bishop went to him to get his son to go on a mission, and he said, "That is the straw that breaks the camels back. We cant spare him. Hes our only child."

Then the bishop countered, "Brother, who do you love in this world more than anyone else, outside of your immediate family?"

And he thought a few minutes. Then he said, "I guess I love that young Mormon missionary who came up to the land of the Midnight Sun and taught me the gospel of Jesus Christ."

Then the bishop countered, "Brother, how would you like somebody to love your boy just like you love that boy?"

He said, "Bishop, you win again. Take him."

Now, God bless you all. Make the best of your lives. Remember - no matter what you get out of this school, and I thank the Lord for the religious training youre getting here - you want to make sure that you prepare for that long journey. To do that, youre going to learn whats in the Lords catalog, his holy scriptures. With all my heart I pray God to bless you all, and I leave you my blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. amen.

			<p>Brothers and sisters, I really feel honored this morning at having been invited to occupy this place, but I feel very humble. I greet all of you students, officers, teachers, wonderful missionaries, and visitors in our midst. We are proud of you and of this great institution, which is one of the important arms of this great Church - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>Now, when you were deciding that you wanted to come here to school (and I suppose I am to talk to the students this morning), you, no doubt, studied the catalog issued by the school and found that there are hundreds of subjects in there, so you had to decide which subjects you wanted. After you decided, then you had to work at it, because it wouldnt do you any good if it just stayed in the catalog.</p>
<h2><b>The Value of Education</b></h2>
<p>There is a story told about a young man who enrolled at Oberlin College. When the president showed him what he would have to study, he said, "Isnt there a shorter course?"</p>
<p>The president said, "Oh, yes. It just depends on what you want to make of yourself. When the Lord starts out to make an oak tree he takes a hundred years for it, but if he wants to make a squash, he does it in six months." Now, I dont suppose any of you want to be squashes.</p>
<p>There was an educator down in Atlanta, Georgia, while I was president of the mission down there. He has talked in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake at educational meetings, and I heard him relate this little story. He said that when he was a boy his father told him it was time for him to decide what he wanted to be in life and what he wanted to make of himself. So he studied the situation and he thought it would be wonderful to be a minister because he thought of the minister in his community and how the people loved him and how much good he did. So he thought hed like to be a minister. Then he thought of being a doctor, how doctors relieve pain and distress and perform operations and increase the life span of people. And he thought it would be wonderful to be a doctor. Then he thought of being an architect and how wonderful it would be to plan buildings and to know that as they rise to the sky they were the result and product of his own brain. So he thought it would be wonderful to be an architect. Then he thought of being a writer and how writers sway the thoughts of men and of their great influence in the world. So he thought it would be wonderful to be a writer. Then he thought of the beautiful ears of corn that his daddy raised on the farm, and how wonderful it would be to be able to make the earth produce like that. So he thought it would be wonderful to be a farmer. And then, being a prayerful man, he got down on his knees and something seemed to say to him, "Why not be a teacher? Your students will preach your sermons for you; your students will perform your operations for you; your students will build your buildings for you; your students will write your books for you; and your students will raise your corn." So he decided that he would be a teacher.</p>
<p>Some years ago, my wife gave me a copy of one of Wigginss books, called <i>The Marks of an Educated Man.</i> She knew that I needed it, and she gave it to me for a birthday present. So I read it. There was a little story in there that intrigued me. It told about a college professor from an agricultural college who went into a farming community to try to induce the boys from the farm to attend the college. In that particular locality, there was a farmer, John, who knew all about farming, and he boo-hooed the idea. He said, "Imagine - going to college to learn how to farm. If you want to learn how to farm, get out on the farm." But his son had the idea that he would like to go to college and sold his mother on the idea, so you know what happened. Well, when the boy came back from college, the father said, "Now you take half of the farm, and Ill take the other half, and well see who knows how to farm - the man from the farm or the man from the college."</p>
<p>One morning Father came in and said, "Ma, what are those boxes up in Sons window?"</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, "hes just testing his seed."</p>
<p>"Hmmm, a man who doesnt know seed when he sees it has no business on a farm." When the crop was gathered in, the father had sixty bushels to the acre, and the boy had ninety bushels to the acre. (I didnt think there was any place they raised that much, but I found it up in Idaho.) The next morning after the count was taken, Father came down the steps all dressed in his best bib and tucker, carrying his little traveling bag. Ma said, "Where are you going, Pa?"</p>
<p>He said, "Im going to college."</p>
<h2><b>The Advantage of Attending BYU</b></h2>
<p>Now, you decided that a college education could enrich your lives, could help you to appreciate the finer things in life - literature, art, music, and the lives of great men and women - so it is worth something to spend your time in college. But there are some fringe benefits, too, that I dont know whether all of you young folks here at Brigham Young University appreciate; that is, so many of the students from all over this world have found their lifes companions here at school. In fact, I understand that President Wilkinson found his wife here, President Oaks found his wife here, and I dont know how many more of the faculty have found their companions here. I travel all over the world, and I stay in the homes of stake presidents. You would be surprised how many of them have met their companions here at this institution. It is worth a lot to this Church to know that our young people meet where they have common interests, thoughts, and beliefs so that they can build happy homes.</p>
<p>I was up in Bountiful last Saturday and Sunday to my conference. In the Sunday morning session they had asked a former stake president (who presided over a stake outside of Utah) to offer the opening prayer. I visited with him and said, "Do you remember when I attended a meeting that you were at when Brigham Young University was trying to promote itself in the various sections of the Church and you told the people in that meeting that you had sent eight children to Brigham Young University and all eight of them had found their companions there?"</p>
<p>"I remember that," he said. "Its nine now, instead of eight; we had one more to come." Well, those are the fringe benefits you get from attending this college.</p>
<h2><b>The Catalog of Scriptures</b></h2>
<p>Now, I have another little thought to go with that. You study the catalog and decide what you want to make of yourselves. Theres another catalog, issued by our Father in heaven, called the holy scriptures. It is important that we study that catalog to know what we want to make of ourselves for the long journey. I like this little statement by Cicero: "I am more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present." I like that thinking: "I am more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present." I think each one of you should be more interested in the long hereafter, and thats one reason why you are here at this church institution.</p>
<p>Jesus said, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 6:39). And without our knowledge of him as the creator of the heavens and the earth and of his great atoning sacrifice, we would not be able to accomplish the measure of our creation here upon this earth. Then he said, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Thats what we find listed in the Lords catalog, the holy scriptures. Jesus said, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Mark 8:3637). It is something to think of giving the whole world, isnt it? Jesus called the gospel "the pearl of great price." He said, "A merchantman, seeking goodly pearls: who when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it" (Matthew 13:4546). That is what a testimony, a witness, and an understanding of what the Lords catalog, his holy scriptures, would do for us. They would become the most important things in our lives.</p>
<p>Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I believe that with all my heart, and I believe that lives and homes that are built upon that principle will never fail.</p>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<p><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i></p>
<p><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i></p>
<p><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. </i>[Matthew 6:1921]</p>
<p>And so these are some of the things that we read in the Lords catalog to live by.</p>
<p>A writer by the name of Munger said, "Measure not life by the hopes and enjoyments of this world, but by the preparation it makes for another - looking forward to what you shall be, rather than backward to what you have been."</p>
<p>Were told in the Lords catalog of scriptures that when this earth was created, the Lord pointed out the new matter and said:</p>
<p><i>We will go down . . . and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i></p>
<p><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i></p>
<p><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon, . . . and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i> [Abraham 3:2426]</p>
<p>Now, thats just a little longer than three or four years at college, isnt it?</p>
<p>The Savior said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;C 82:10). Thats why we need to know whats recorded in his catalog, or in his holy scriptures.</p>
<p>Following the day of Pentecost, Peter preached to those who had put Christ to death. He had such power as he proclaimed the life of the Master and his great atoning sacrifice that we are told they were pricked in their hearts and cried out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them:</p>
<p><i>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i></p>
<p><i>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</i> [Acts 2:3839]</p>
<p>That promise has never been rescinded. Its there in his catalog. All we have to do is abide it, and then were entitled to the gift of the Spirit. As he said, "The promise is unto all." Jesus also said, "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you" (John 16:7). "He shall take from the Father and from me and reveal it unto you. All things," he said, "we could know by the power of the Holy Ghost, and we can know the truth of all things by that power of the Holy Ghost" (see Moroni 10:5).</p>
<h2><b>Sow to the Spirit</b></h2>
<p>Paul said, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Galatians 6:78). In my position in the Church, Ive found some who sowed to the flesh. They come in with their troubles and, I tell you, then I wished I had the power to touch the hearts of every boy and girl in the world to enable them to have enough courage to sow only to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some years ago I was asked to talk in the state penitentiary. We had a pretty good crowd there; there was nowhere else for them to go. And because of that meeting there was quite a group that came up to visit with me. One was a grandson of one of the Presidents of the Church, one was the grandson of one of the Presiding bishops (not related to me), one had been a ward clerk, one had been a district president in the mission field, and they were there because they had sowed to the flesh. I tell you, my heart went out to them under those conditions. When I was there, I was invited to return again to talk to the Alcoholics Anonymous group. (I made sure I got a round-trip ticket so I could get out once I got in there.) When I came I said, "Id like to hear from you men. How do you feel? What can you tell me?"</p>
<p>And the man in charge of that group stood up and he said, "I thank God for the privilege of being in this institution." Can you imagine? Thats what you get when you sow to the flesh. He thanked God for the privilege of being in that state penitentiary. He said, "Before I came here, I was no good to my family, I was no good to my country, I was no good to my church. I was just no good, period. Now, I have hopes that when I get out of here Ill be worth something to somebody." Thats what it means to sow to the Spirit.</p>
<h2><b>Missionary Work</b></h2>
<p>One of the great promises of the Lord is in connection with missionary work. (We have some young men here preparing to go into the mission field.) Personally, I wouldnt want to raise a boy and then not have him go on a mission. I feel this way for his good and because we owe it to the world to share the wonderful truths of the gospel. Nephi of old saw our day. He saw the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. He saw the establishment of the Lords latter-day kingdom. He saw the Saints of God gathered upon the face of the whole earth and the power of God resting upon them in great glory. Then he said:</p>
<p><i>Blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb.</i> [1 Nephi 13:37]</p>
<p>"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings" (Mosiah 15:18). What a promise! How could this work fill the whole earth except for the great missionary program of the Church?</p>
<p>I was interested in a little story that Brother Benson told us the other day. He was back East attending a convention, and he attended a banquet where he sat next to a minister. The minister turned to him and said, "Mr. Benson, Id like to talk to you after the banquet." They went to the other end of the banquet hall, and the minister said, "There are two things in your church we would like to copy."</p>
<p>Brother Benson said, "What are they?"</p>
<p>He said, "The first is your missionary program. You send your missionaries all over the world, they pay their way to their field of labor, they maintain themselves while theyre there, and then, out of the church funds, you pay their fare home if theyve been good missionaries. Now, we have a missionary fund in our church, and we offer to pay their way to their mission field, maintain them while theyre there and pay their way back, but we cant get anybody to go."</p>
<p>I talk to the missionaries in the mission home every Tuesday afternoon. We always have between two and three hundred there. As I see those fine-looking men, I say to myself, "Talk about the miracles of ancient days! This is a miracle every day." I see them coming from all over the Church. Nobody but God the Eternal Father can put into their hearts the willingness to serve as they have, and we have over eighteen thousand missionaries in the mission field today. Now President Kimball is asking us to lengthen our stride. He thinks we ought to have double that many, and I think we will in just a very short time because of this call that comes to us from the Lord. You know we sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days." President Grant used to say about that, "Some of the Saints would like to put a P.S. on it: provided the prophet doesnt ask us to do something we dont want to do."</p>
<p>In the early days of the Church, when the brethren joined the Church they would inquire of the Lord what thing they could do that would be most pleasing unto him. The answer would come back that they were to thrust in their sickles and reap because the harvest was white, all ready to be garnered (see D&amp;C 4:4). Then he adds:</p>
<p><i>If it be so that you should labor all your days . . . and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!</i></p>
<p><i>And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me . . . how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!</i> [D&amp;C 18:1516]</p>
<p>Now, I went on my first mission (I have been on four missions) seventy years ago this coming April, and I count the families that Ive been instrumental in bringing into this Church. I wouldnt sell them out of the Church for all the money in this world. Talk about the fact that their joy shall be great in the kingdom of my father: by the dozens and the hundreds today, these converts and their children almost worship me because of what I brought to them.</p>
<p>I remember one little story that President Grant used to tell that Id like to tell you in closing. He told about a Scandinavian couple who came over in the early days of the Church. They hadnt been taught much about the gospel, so all they knew was that it was true. The bishop went to this family and taught them the law of tithing. The man paid his tithing. Then the bishop went and taught them about fast offerings. He paid his fast offerings. Then the bishop went to him later to get a donation to help build the meetinghouse. He thought that ought to come out of the tithing, but before the bishop got through with him he paid his donations for the meetinghouse. Then the bishop went to him to get his son to go on a mission, and he said, "That is the straw that breaks the camels back. We cant spare him. Hes our only child."</p>
<p>Then the bishop countered, "Brother, who do you love in this world more than anyone else, outside of your immediate family?"</p>
<p>And he thought a few minutes. Then he said, "I guess I love that young Mormon missionary who came up to the land of the Midnight Sun and taught me the gospel of Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Then the bishop countered, "Brother, how would you like somebody to love your boy just like you love that boy?"</p>
<p>He said, "Bishop, you win again. Take him."</p>
<p>Now, God bless you all. Make the best of your lives. Remember - no matter what you get out of this school, and I thank the Lord for the religious training youre getting here - you want to make sure that you prepare for that long journey. To do that, youre going to learn whats in the Lords catalog, his holy scriptures. With all my heart I pray God to bless you all, and I leave you my blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an adjunct professor who has taught at BYU for several years, I am in awe of this amazing institution that attracts the finest, most extraordinary faculty and stu-dents on the planet.
I honor you and believe that King Benjamin could have easily been describing you when he said:
And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual. [Mosiah 2:41]
Yes, you are awesome, and this could be the most important assignment I have ever had as a professional speaker. Consequently, I wanted to be at my best.
However, as I was getting ready this morning, I noticed that I was losing hair on my head and growing it in my nose and ears and on my back - in places I dont even need it. That is not a fair trade-off. My only hope this morning was that the hair in my right ear would grow long enough so that I could comb it up over the top of my head and fake all of you out! It didnt happen.
When President Worthen asked me to speak to you today, two life-altering experiences surfaced in my mind, helping me focus my remarks. First, I recently returned from an eighteen-day military tribute tour with my invited guests American Idol finalist/Sony recording artist David Archuleta; world-class musician, vocal coach, and musical director Dean Kaelin; and celebrity impressionist Jason Hewlett. We performed our Evening of Music, Comedy, and Motivational Theater to fourteen amazing audiences; held six firesides for the U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Kuwait along the Iraqi border; and concluded the tour with a special visit to the missionaries, members, and investigators in Ethiopia. We were touched by the dedication of Church members and the fearless commitment to service before self of our brave men and women in uniform. And when we got shot at and returned machine gun fire during one of our flights in a Chinook helicopter to a remote forward operating base, I realized that we should never take our freedom for granted and was reminded of the sense of urgency with which we all should live our lives.
The second life-altering experience happened on October 23, 2010, when I had the rare opportunity to soar to the edge of space in a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Because it was a classified mission, I can only tell you that at 70,000 feet you can see two-thirds of the state of California. At 80,000 feet you can see some distinctly mapped outlines of America. And at 90,000 feet you tear up and feel like you can reach out and touch the face of God! It was a spiritual experience I wish each of you could have.
For four hours I sat in the sounds of silence, looking at the breathtaking curvature of the earth, gazing into the endless blackness of space, pondering eternity, and reflecting on President Dieter F. Uchtdorfs reminder that we are more </span>

One of the blessings of being a General Authority is that we have the opportunity of being with you across the world. In the past few months, we have seen your faces and shaken your hands in many locations in the United States. We traveled with President and Sister Uchtdorf last June to Eastern Europe, Russia, and the United Kingdom. In October we were in South Africa and West Africa. In November we returned from Central America. There is a great power of righteousness among the young adults and youth of this Church. Take comfort in knowing that you are joined by thousands and hundreds of thousands in the challenges you face and in the important purposes you feel. I love you and pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us as we discuss things that are important to you tonight.
I have lived in this mortal life three to four decades longer than most of you, but it is not my experience that brings me before you. Realizing my own weaknesses, I stand before you as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, ordained and commissioned to testify of Him and to speak the things He would speak. My assignment tonight comes from the Saviors chief Apostle, President Thomas S. Monson.
As I look at you, I think of myself 37 years ago. I had just returned from a mission to France. With few resources other than a little borrowed money, I had come to Brigham Young University. I had found work as a window washer on the campus. It would be another year before I would meet the light of my life, Kathy Williams. I felt somewhat alone and unsure about the road ahead. I remember thinking, "What is in my future, and how should I prepare for it?"
Remembering these thoughts, I have entitled my message tonight "Preparing for Your Spiritual Destiny."
When Jesus was upon the earth, He would often speak of tangible objects to help His disciples better understand the intangible, the spiritual. He spoke of seeds and grain and barns and hens and flowers and foxes and dozens of other physical objects to help people understand more about faith and repentance, spiritual power and salvation.
He did not speak of airplanes, as they were not a part of His society, but President Uchtdorf has made up for that in the last few years and has given us wonderful teachings from his own experiences as a pilot.
I have an airplane story tonight that will teach us about preparing for our spiritual destiny.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear young friends, the spirit which permeates this meeting here in the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University and in hundreds of other locations throughout the world is a reflection of your strength, your devotion, and your goodness. How grateful I am to be with you this evening. You bring to mind the words penned by the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:
How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams
With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!
Book of Beginnings, Story without End,
Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!1
In addition to being with all of you, Im pleased to be with members of my family tonight.
Recently I reread an old favorite of mine by Charles Dickens entitled Great Expectations. You who have read this classic will recall that Dickens speaks of a young boy by the name of Philip Pirrip, more commonly known as Pip. Little Pip was an orphan who could not remember ever having seen his mother or his father. He had all the desires of a boy. He wished with all his heart that he were a scholar. He wished that he were a gentleman. He wished that he were less ignorant. Yet all of his ambitions and all of his hopes seemed doomed to failure until one day a London lawyer by the name of Jaggers approached little Pip and told him that an unknown benefactor had bequeathed a fortune to him. Then that lawyer said that little Pip was "a young fellow of great expectations."2
Today, as I contemplate who you are and what you are, who you may become and what you may become, I say to you, as that lawyer said about Pip, you have great expectations - not as the result of an unknown benefactor, but as the result of a known benefactor - even our Heavenly Father - and great things are expected of you.
Prepare for the Race of Life
Many of you here tonight are close to completing your formal education. (Well have a moment of cheer on that one.) Others of you have additional periods of academic preparation ahead. Each is in what could be called the race of life.
The writer of the book of Ecclesiastes wrote, "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Ecclesiastes 9:11); it is to him who endures to the end. The race of life is so important, the prize so valued, that great emphasis must necessarily be placed on adequate and thorough preparation.
When we contemplate the eternal nature of our choices, preparation is a vital factor in our lives. The day will come when we will look upon our period of preparation and be grateful that we properly applied ourselves.
Many years ago, before I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve, I had the opportunity to address a business convention in Dallas, Texas - known as "the city of churches." After the convention I took a sightseeing bus ride about the citys suburbs. As we would pass the beautiful churches, our driver would co</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters. My wife and I are greatly honored to be with you enthusiastic students at this wonderful university. I have titled my message "Just in Case Someone Asks, I Will Be Ready."
As a teenager I found a simple thought that had guided Abraham Lincolns life. President Lincoln was asked how he was able to become the president of the United States. His self-effacing answer was, "I kept preparing myself just in case."1 This down-to-earth phrase inspired me, and I began looking for ways that could prepare me to be ready for the future.
For example, as a young missionary in Brazil, I decided to learn to speak and read Portuguese 100 percent. Returning home from my mission, I didnt think I would be using Portuguese again. But two years later I took the medical school entrance exam, and, lo and behold, my Portuguese was extremely helpful because Portuguese is a strongly influenced Latin-based language - as are many medical terms. Twenty years later I returned to So Paulo, Brazil, with my family as a mission president, and 35 years after that original decision, my wife and I returned to serve in the Area Presidency in the north of Brazil. Even today the joy of speaking another language without having to interpret word for word in my mind is a mystery and a blessing.
Another example: I, like many other Church members listening to Elder Neal A. Maxwells talks, noted that he would regularly cite from John Bartletts Familiar Quotations. So I started to read Bartletts Familiar Quotations to be prepared just in case someone asked me to give a talk in church.
Thomas Edison said, "Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work."2 Likewise, Benjamin Disraeli said, "The great secret of success in life is for a man to be ready when his opportunity comes."3 President Henry B. Eyring has often recalled important counsel his father gave him. That counsel was, "Hal, . . . you ought to find something that you love so much that when you dont have to think about anything, thats what you think about."4 For me that means we will be prepared for inspiration on a specific topic if we have been seriously contemplating it. Some, on the other hand, may conclude that it is too hard to always be preparing or to do such focused thinking. But doing hard things builds confidence and strengthens character. We learn much from those who lean hard against us.
To prepare just in case someone asks becomes even more important as the world becomes more complex. One approach in preparing ourselves is to simplify and find the "kernel" truths and thoughts. A "kernel operator" in mathematics transforms the original unwieldy and perhaps confusing problem into an easier solution. In computer technology the kernel is the central component of most operating systems. It is the co</span>
