  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I want you students to know that when a few of the favored were being applauded earlier and I received no applause you made me feel like a social reject. You can correct that if you like. [laughter and applause]

I told someone tonight that when President Tanner called yesterday and asked if I would fill in for him - please note, not take his place but fill in for him - I thought that I could best relate my feelings by telling you that I know how Marc Wilson, a BYU second-string quarterback, felt when they asked him to go in for All-American candidate Gifford Nielson. Marc, I just hope I can do nearly as well as you did as a substitute.

I am very sorry that President Tanner is unable to be with us tonight. He has a very bad cold. I hope he will be the beneficiary of your faith and prayers.

I am very pleased to be with you to demonstrate to President Tanner and others that I would do anything for him - even this! Tonight gives me an opportunity to talk about a subject that is very close to me. As the contents of my remarks unfold, you will quickly realize that if President Tanner knew what I am going to speak about he would not have allowed me to fill in for him.

While attending a mission presidents seminar in South America about three weeks ago, I had the opportunity of associating with mission presidents and their wives and some of the missionaries. The usual question they asked was, "How is President Kimball?" and when I assured them he was well and vigorous as usual they said, "Give him our love when you return." Following these comments one of the mission presidents said in an open forum where people, principles, policies, and purposes were discussed, "Tell us about President N. Eldon Tanner." On that occasion in South America I was impressed to say - and I probably say it with more conviction tonight than I did three weeks ago, "President N. Eldon Tanner will go down in history as one of the greatest counselors ever to serve in the First Presidency of the Church."

For more than fourteen years President Tanner has served with four different presidents of the Church: David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Spencer W. Kimball. He will be eighty in May, and his performance today is solid and significant. As we think about the Christmas season, perhaps my gift to all of you would be the example of the life of President N. Eldon Tanner. Tonight I would like to share with you some of his traits and strengths, hoping that we can apply these principles in our daily lives for our total self-improvement.

First of all I would like to speak about the trait and strength of humility as I have found it in the life of President Tanner. As the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and other General Authorities have met in the upper room of the temple on a once-a-month basis, President Kimball has never failed to call upon President Tanner to bear his testimony at the conclusion of these meetings. How often I have heard him say, "What am I doing here? I have so little to offer; I feel like Im the least among you." In a spirit of true humility he asks, "What am I doing here? What do I have to offer?" and he will follow it by saying, "Nevertheless, I pray every night and morning for God to help me to do my part." I have heard him say, "All I want to do in Gods kingdom is do what he wants me to do." In modestly accepting compliments I have heard him say, "Now why would anyone want to say that about me?"

President N. Eldon Tanner closely follows the 112th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse ten: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." We would serve ourselves and other well if we could humbly say, "I dont know why Ive been called," or, if you please, "I dont know why I havent been called, but Im going to do the best I can." Brothers and sisters, students, leaders, do not let yourselves be concerned about your limitations or lack of talent; resolve positively with more vigor and determination tonight than ever before, "I may not be much; I may not have much going for me, but in his strength I can do all things." As I think of the life of this great man, I see that humility is not a weakness; humility is a strength. I have often heard President Tanner say, "God cannot answer our prayers unless we are humble."

President N. Eldon Tanner is known by his associates in and out of the Church as Mr. Integrity, a man of character, a man of quality, an advocate of self-discipline. Frequently in conference he has admonished, "Be honest. Dont be a hypocrite. Be what you should be." He is a man of few words and much performance. I have never heard him make a cheap or shabby remark. I have never seen him when he was not a gentleman, when he was not the personification of integrity.

My first contact with President N. Eldon Tanner was in Canada more than twenty years ago. We had called a thirty-minute meeting for 7:00 p.m., prior to the other meetings, just to meet with the stake presidents. I remember well that night when seven oclock arrived - two of us were there. I was there and a man I had never met before, a President Tanner. I will never forget the remark and the lesson that I learned as I looked at my watch, saw that it was seven oclock and asked this man I had never met before, "President Tanner, what do you suggest we do?"

He looked at me and replied, "Youre here; Im here; its seven oclock. Lets start."

Another great character strength of President Tanner is that he is a friend to member and nonmember alike, a friend in the fullest sense of the word. He is a lifter, a builder, a leader. He is comfortable in any type of setting. I have never seen him when he did not fit and when he did not make other people, no matter what the circumstances, feel welcome and happy to be in his company. President Tanner is willing to take you and me from where we are and help us go forward from that point.

We learn another great lesson shared by his secretary, LeRue Sneff. She has said that on occasion President Tanner has said to her, "In my office in the Church Office Building, I like to maintain such an atmosphere that those who come to call will go out feeling better than they did when they came in." You and I should resolve to lift our associates under all circumstances. In this day and age we too need to resist the temptation or the practice of cutting people down, even if we think they deserve it. I have never heard President Tanner cut anyone down. But I have often heard him say, when someone has fallen or disappointed, "Lets see what we can do to help him."

Speaking of friends, wherever, whenever, however, I will not soon forget an experience that took place about this time last year. My phone rang. President Tanner was on the line and he said, "I have a letter here this morning from one of the inmates at the Utah State Prison. He wants to talk to me about something. Do you think you could arrange with the warden for me to talk with this inmate on the phone? I dont think Im going to have time to go and see him. Do you think you could arrange that?"

I said, "President Tanner, I think I can." I have a few connections in the Utah State Prison. I have spent a lot of time there - as a visitor. And by talking with Warden Smith I arranged for this man to come out of maximum security and have the use of a telephone to talk to a President Tanner who had time for him. I do not know what they talked about; I just made the appointment. I shared this instance with you to let you know that this is the kind of a man N. Eldon Tanner is - a friend regardless of where we are or what we have done.

We had a recent experience with a missionary in a missionary conference, and I think it can tie in well to the attitude and strength of President Tanner. We had approximately seventy-five missionaries for this meeting. We took the time to give opportunity for testimony bearing. I remember only one testimony very well. One young man stood up among his peers, grabbed hold of the front of the pew - I thought he was going to pull it out, he was so nervous - cleared his throat, and said, "I almost didnt come on a mission. One night I said to my dad, I dont know about this Joseph Smith business. Im not even sure about this Spencer W. Kimball. Im not even sure I want to go." We all turned around and looked at him, wondering what was going to happen next. He said, "When I said that to my father, my father got up from where he was seated. He turned on the light. He walked over and turned off the television. He smashed out his cigarette. He put down his can of beer, and he said, "Son, you know I dont do much about this church. You know Im inactive, but I want you to know that I know Joseph Smiths a prophet of God, and I know that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet."

The elder said, "I love my dad. His comments made me want to go on a mission more than ever because I knew my dad would never be able to go and I had double duty to do. Ive got to do a mission for myself and one for my dad." How easy it would have been for him to say, "What chance do I have?" with a father who was completely inactive! I think of President N. Eldon Tanner when I think of that kind of a situation, of how many boys and girls he has helped to straighten their priorities and thinking so that family conditions and environment do not diver their ways.

I would like to say a word or two about this great man as he relates to vision and vigor. A tireless, dedicated leader, he is about his Fathers business early and late. I say without reservation that I have never met a man with greater judgment or superior wisdom.

In an honor banquet in Salt Lake City last Thursday evening to recognize the lives and performances of J. Willard and Alice Marriott, for whom this building we meet in tonight is named, President Tanner, in paying one of the tributes to these great members and friends of the Church, said,

&lt;i&gt;It is not because of the money the Marriotts have made or the great number of hotels they have built that we respect them and admire them; it is because of the kind of lives they live. They have adopted the code, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you," and have lived it continually. The Church has benefited greatly by them and their aid in the building of temples, chapels, buildings, and other things and assisting worldwide in the great missionary effort.&lt;/i&gt;

Could we as students, as we pursue proper priorities with vision and vigor, recall President N. Eldon Tanners comment that I have heard him make when there have been mighty decisions and responsibilities to perform: "All we have to do is what is right. "Thank the Lord that he believes in doing that which is right, rather than that which is only expedient.

President Tanner is a great husband, a wonderful father, and a worthy son. His loyal and supportive wife is his sweetheart and companion. All you have to do is be around President and Sister Tanner to see that they enjoy being with each other. She is his greatest advocate. Recently I heard one of their daughters say, "All through Daddys life he has found time for us and has always made us feel important." President Tanner often gives thanks to a father and a mother who taught him to work and have lofty goals. He said, "My Father taught me the virtue of dependability." May I share with you a teaching experience that President Tanner had with one of his daughters and her girlfriend. President Tanner said,

&lt;i&gt;Let me relate a little story that I have told all over the Church. My daughter and her girl friend were at our house, and they were going to a party; then two young men came and called for them. I sat and talked to them about different things, and just before they were ready to leave, I said, "Now have a good time, kids." But just as they were going out of the door, I stepped over to my daughter and said, "Now, behave yourself."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And she said, "Well, Dad, make up your mind."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then I said to those young people so they could all hear me, "Have a good time, kids, the best time you will ever have in your lives, but the kind of time that tomorrow, next week, a month from now or a year from now, ten years from now, you can look back on tonight and say, I had a good time and have nothing to regret or to be sorry about." And I think they went out and had a good time. &lt;/i&gt;[N. Eldon Tanner, &lt;i&gt;Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God,&lt;/i&gt; p. 3]

I wish we could learn that great lesson. How will you and I feel about todays conduct tomorrow? Give God the joy of loving you at your best.

President Tanner has been selfless in service. In responding to the tribute paid him by President Tanner and others, Brother J. Willard Marriott said, "President Tanner, you are a prime example of what a true Latter-day Saint can do for his Church. When you came to Salt Lake City from Canada as a General Authority you built a new home; before the paint was dry you were called to serve a mission in Europe. Your service to the Church has always been outstanding."

President Tanner has always taken the time to serve in the community, the home, and the Church, whether it has been convenient or not. He was elected to the Alberta, Canada, provincial government and was named Speaker of the House. He then served in the provincial cabinet as head of the Department of Lands and Mines, one of the most important positions in Canadian government. In Church and community businesses, his skill and wisdom continue to benefit millions. He is truly a man among men.

As I now read some well-known lines to you, would you please note how well they meet the philosophy and creed of President Tanner. Also note how all of us, beginning today, can apply the truths and the challenges shared. Whenever I hear these words spoken or sung, I think of President N. Eldon Tanner.

&lt;i&gt;Have I done any good in the world today?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Have I helped any one in need?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Have I cheered up the sad, and made someone feel glad?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If not, I have failed indeed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Has any ones burden been lighter today,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Because I was willing to share?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When they needed my help was I there? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There are chances for work all around just now,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Opportunities right in our way;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Do not let them pass by, saying, "Sometime Ill try,"&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But go and do something today.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tis noble of man to work and to give,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Love labor has merit alone;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Only he who does something is worthy to live,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The world has not use for the drone.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then wake up, and do something more&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Than dream of your mansions above:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A blessing of duty and love.&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; no. 58]

President Tanner is a Christian gentleman; a courteous, kind, and capable prophet of God; a special witness of the Savior Jesus Christ; a man who rightly sits on the right-hand side of the prophet Spencer W. Kimball; a man whose declaration "I know President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God" carries profound significance, because who among earthly men knows the prophet better? I thank my Heavenly Father for the life and the example of President N. Eldon Tanner. I pray that all of us will try to incorporate in our lives the wonderful traits he exemplifies for us in his life. I would like you, brothers and sisters, to know that I love this great man with all my heart. I sustain and support him. I promise you success and happiness in life, each of you, if you will follow his example

I leave you my testimony that these are the things that are important in life; these are the gifts at Christmastime that are eternal. If I know President Tanner, the next few weeks will be spent visiting those who are not expecting him; maybe people like those who study under different conditions and with different challenges than you, even those at American Fork - those who have challenges mentally and physically. I have an idea that there are going to be people in that Utah State Prison who will hear from him. I am sure that he would encourage us at this Christmastime to make it a point to be friendly with an unfriendly neighbor, and I can hear him say, "The only unfriendly neighbors we have are those that we do not know very well." I think we will find him going to the hospital, writing letters to missionaries who do not have parents, calling on those who are widows and those who have tragedy come. These are the measures of greatness that we find in this wonderful man.

Again, let me thank you for the opportunity of being with you. I leave you my witness at this time of year that Jesus is the Christ and that God lives, and he knows you, and he wants to hear from you. These things I declare humbly and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I want you students to know that when a few of the favored were being applauded earlier and I received no applause you made me feel like a social reject. You can correct that if you like. [laughter and applause]</p>
<p>I told someone tonight that when President Tanner called yesterday and asked if I would fill in for him - please note, not take his place but fill in for him - I thought that I could best relate my feelings by telling you that I know how Marc Wilson, a BYU second-string quarterback, felt when they asked him to go in for All-American candidate Gifford Nielson. Marc, I just hope I can do nearly as well as you did as a substitute.</p>
<p>I am very sorry that President Tanner is unable to be with us tonight. He has a very bad cold. I hope he will be the beneficiary of your faith and prayers.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to be with you to demonstrate to President Tanner and others that I would do anything for him - even this! Tonight gives me an opportunity to talk about a subject that is very close to me. As the contents of my remarks unfold, you will quickly realize that if President Tanner knew what I am going to speak about he would not have allowed me to fill in for him.</p>
<p>While attending a mission presidents seminar in South America about three weeks ago, I had the opportunity of associating with mission presidents and their wives and some of the missionaries. The usual question they asked was, "How is President Kimball?" and when I assured them he was well and vigorous as usual they said, "Give him our love when you return." Following these comments one of the mission presidents said in an open forum where people, principles, policies, and purposes were discussed, "Tell us about President N. Eldon Tanner." On that occasion in South America I was impressed to say - and I probably say it with more conviction tonight than I did three weeks ago, "President N. Eldon Tanner will go down in history as one of the greatest counselors ever to serve in the First Presidency of the Church."</p>
<p>For more than fourteen years President Tanner has served with four different presidents of the Church: David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Spencer W. Kimball. He will be eighty in May, and his performance today is solid and significant. As we think about the Christmas season, perhaps my gift to all of you would be the example of the life of President N. Eldon Tanner. Tonight I would like to share with you some of his traits and strengths, hoping that we can apply these principles in our daily lives for our total self-improvement.</p>
<p>First of all I would like to speak about the trait and strength of humility as I have found it in the life of President Tanner. As the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and other General Authorities have met in the upper room of the temple on a once-a-month basis, President Kimball has never failed to call upon President Tanner to bear his testimony at the conclusion of these meetings. How often I have heard him say, "What am I doing here? I have so little to offer; I feel like Im the least among you." In a spirit of true humility he asks, "What am I doing here? What do I have to offer?" and he will follow it by saying, "Nevertheless, I pray every night and morning for God to help me to do my part." I have heard him say, "All I want to do in Gods kingdom is do what he wants me to do." In modestly accepting compliments I have heard him say, "Now why would anyone want to say that about me?"</p>
<p>President N. Eldon Tanner closely follows the 112th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse ten: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." We would serve ourselves and other well if we could humbly say, "I dont know why Ive been called," or, if you please, "I dont know why I havent been called, but Im going to do the best I can." Brothers and sisters, students, leaders, do not let yourselves be concerned about your limitations or lack of talent; resolve positively with more vigor and determination tonight than ever before, "I may not be much; I may not have much going for me, but in his strength I can do all things." As I think of the life of this great man, I see that humility is not a weakness; humility is a strength. I have often heard President Tanner say, "God cannot answer our prayers unless we are humble."</p>
<p>President N. Eldon Tanner is known by his associates in and out of the Church as Mr. Integrity, a man of character, a man of quality, an advocate of self-discipline. Frequently in conference he has admonished, "Be honest. Dont be a hypocrite. Be what you should be." He is a man of few words and much performance. I have never heard him make a cheap or shabby remark. I have never seen him when he was not a gentleman, when he was not the personification of integrity.</p>
<p>My first contact with President N. Eldon Tanner was in Canada more than twenty years ago. We had called a thirty-minute meeting for 7:00 p.m., prior to the other meetings, just to meet with the stake presidents. I remember well that night when seven oclock arrived - two of us were there. I was there and a man I had never met before, a President Tanner. I will never forget the remark and the lesson that I learned as I looked at my watch, saw that it was seven oclock and asked this man I had never met before, "President Tanner, what do you suggest we do?"</p>
<p>He looked at me and replied, "Youre here; Im here; its seven oclock. Lets start."</p>
<p>Another great character strength of President Tanner is that he is a friend to member and nonmember alike, a friend in the fullest sense of the word. He is a lifter, a builder, a leader. He is comfortable in any type of setting. I have never seen him when he did not fit and when he did not make other people, no matter what the circumstances, feel welcome and happy to be in his company. President Tanner is willing to take you and me from where we are and help us go forward from that point.</p>
<p>We learn another great lesson shared by his secretary, LeRue Sneff. She has said that on occasion President Tanner has said to her, "In my office in the Church Office Building, I like to maintain such an atmosphere that those who come to call will go out feeling better than they did when they came in." You and I should resolve to lift our associates under all circumstances. In this day and age we too need to resist the temptation or the practice of cutting people down, even if we think they deserve it. I have never heard President Tanner cut anyone down. But I have often heard him say, when someone has fallen or disappointed, "Lets see what we can do to help him."</p>
<p>Speaking of friends, wherever, whenever, however, I will not soon forget an experience that took place about this time last year. My phone rang. President Tanner was on the line and he said, "I have a letter here this morning from one of the inmates at the Utah State Prison. He wants to talk to me about something. Do you think you could arrange with the warden for me to talk with this inmate on the phone? I dont think Im going to have time to go and see him. Do you think you could arrange that?"</p>
<p>I said, "President Tanner, I think I can." I have a few connections in the Utah State Prison. I have spent a lot of time there - as a visitor. And by talking with Warden Smith I arranged for this man to come out of maximum security and have the use of a telephone to talk to a President Tanner who had time for him. I do not know what they talked about; I just made the appointment. I shared this instance with you to let you know that this is the kind of a man N. Eldon Tanner is - a friend regardless of where we are or what we have done.</p>
<p>We had a recent experience with a missionary in a missionary conference, and I think it can tie in well to the attitude and strength of President Tanner. We had approximately seventy-five missionaries for this meeting. We took the time to give opportunity for testimony bearing. I remember only one testimony very well. One young man stood up among his peers, grabbed hold of the front of the pew - I thought he was going to pull it out, he was so nervous - cleared his throat, and said, "I almost didnt come on a mission. One night I said to my dad, I dont know about this Joseph Smith business. Im not even sure about this Spencer W. Kimball. Im not even sure I want to go." We all turned around and looked at him, wondering what was going to happen next. He said, "When I said that to my father, my father got up from where he was seated. He turned on the light. He walked over and turned off the television. He smashed out his cigarette. He put down his can of beer, and he said, "Son, you know I dont do much about this church. You know Im inactive, but I want you to know that I know Joseph Smiths a prophet of God, and I know that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet."</p>
<p>The elder said, "I love my dad. His comments made me want to go on a mission more than ever because I knew my dad would never be able to go and I had double duty to do. Ive got to do a mission for myself and one for my dad." How easy it would have been for him to say, "What chance do I have?" with a father who was completely inactive! I think of President N. Eldon Tanner when I think of that kind of a situation, of how many boys and girls he has helped to straighten their priorities and thinking so that family conditions and environment do not diver their ways.</p>
<p>I would like to say a word or two about this great man as he relates to vision and vigor. A tireless, dedicated leader, he is about his Fathers business early and late. I say without reservation that I have never met a man with greater judgment or superior wisdom.</p>
<p>In an honor banquet in Salt Lake City last Thursday evening to recognize the lives and performances of J. Willard and Alice Marriott, for whom this building we meet in tonight is named, President Tanner, in paying one of the tributes to these great members and friends of the Church, said,</p>
<p><i>It is not because of the money the Marriotts have made or the great number of hotels they have built that we respect them and admire them; it is because of the kind of lives they live. They have adopted the code, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you," and have lived it continually. The Church has benefited greatly by them and their aid in the building of temples, chapels, buildings, and other things and assisting worldwide in the great missionary effort.</i></p>
<p>Could we as students, as we pursue proper priorities with vision and vigor, recall President N. Eldon Tanners comment that I have heard him make when there have been mighty decisions and responsibilities to perform: "All we have to do is what is right. "Thank the Lord that he believes in doing that which is right, rather than that which is only expedient.</p>
<p>President Tanner is a great husband, a wonderful father, and a worthy son. His loyal and supportive wife is his sweetheart and companion. All you have to do is be around President and Sister Tanner to see that they enjoy being with each other. She is his greatest advocate. Recently I heard one of their daughters say, "All through Daddys life he has found time for us and has always made us feel important." President Tanner often gives thanks to a father and a mother who taught him to work and have lofty goals. He said, "My Father taught me the virtue of dependability." May I share with you a teaching experience that President Tanner had with one of his daughters and her girlfriend. President Tanner said,</p>
<p><i>Let me relate a little story that I have told all over the Church. My daughter and her girl friend were at our house, and they were going to a party; then two young men came and called for them. I sat and talked to them about different things, and just before they were ready to leave, I said, "Now have a good time, kids." But just as they were going out of the door, I stepped over to my daughter and said, "Now, behave yourself."</i></p>
<p><i>And she said, "Well, Dad, make up your mind."</i></p>
<p><i>Then I said to those young people so they could all hear me, "Have a good time, kids, the best time you will ever have in your lives, but the kind of time that tomorrow, next week, a month from now or a year from now, ten years from now, you can look back on tonight and say, I had a good time and have nothing to regret or to be sorry about." And I think they went out and had a good time. </i>[N. Eldon Tanner, <i>Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God,</i> p. 3]</p>
<p>I wish we could learn that great lesson. How will you and I feel about todays conduct tomorrow? Give God the joy of loving you at your best.</p>
<p>President Tanner has been selfless in service. In responding to the tribute paid him by President Tanner and others, Brother J. Willard Marriott said, "President Tanner, you are a prime example of what a true Latter-day Saint can do for his Church. When you came to Salt Lake City from Canada as a General Authority you built a new home; before the paint was dry you were called to serve a mission in Europe. Your service to the Church has always been outstanding."</p>
<p>President Tanner has always taken the time to serve in the community, the home, and the Church, whether it has been convenient or not. He was elected to the Alberta, Canada, provincial government and was named Speaker of the House. He then served in the provincial cabinet as head of the Department of Lands and Mines, one of the most important positions in Canadian government. In Church and community businesses, his skill and wisdom continue to benefit millions. He is truly a man among men.</p>
<p>As I now read some well-known lines to you, would you please note how well they meet the philosophy and creed of President Tanner. Also note how all of us, beginning today, can apply the truths and the challenges shared. Whenever I hear these words spoken or sung, I think of President N. Eldon Tanner.</p>
<p><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i><br />
<i>Have I helped any one in need?</i><br />
<i>Have I cheered up the sad, and made someone feel glad?</i><br />
<i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i></p>
<p><i>Has any ones burden been lighter today,</i><br />
<i>Because I was willing to share?</i><br />
<i>Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?</i><br />
<i>When they needed my help was I there? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>There are chances for work all around just now,</i><br />
<i>Opportunities right in our way;</i><br />
<i>Do not let them pass by, saying, "Sometime Ill try,"</i><br />
<i>But go and do something today.</i></p>
<p><i>Tis noble of man to work and to give,</i><br />
<i>Love labor has merit alone;</i><br />
<i>Only he who does something is worthy to live,</i><br />
<i>The world has not use for the drone.</i></p>
<p><i>Then wake up, and do something more</i><br />
<i>Than dream of your mansions above:</i><br />
<i>Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,</i><br />
<i>A blessing of duty and love.</i><br />
[<i>Hymns,</i> no. 58]</p>
<p>President Tanner is a Christian gentleman; a courteous, kind, and capable prophet of God; a special witness of the Savior Jesus Christ; a man who rightly sits on the right-hand side of the prophet Spencer W. Kimball; a man whose declaration "I know President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God" carries profound significance, because who among earthly men knows the prophet better? I thank my Heavenly Father for the life and the example of President N. Eldon Tanner. I pray that all of us will try to incorporate in our lives the wonderful traits he exemplifies for us in his life. I would like you, brothers and sisters, to know that I love this great man with all my heart. I sustain and support him. I promise you success and happiness in life, each of you, if you will follow his example</p>
<p>I leave you my testimony that these are the things that are important in life; these are the gifts at Christmastime that are eternal. If I know President Tanner, the next few weeks will be spent visiting those who are not expecting him; maybe people like those who study under different conditions and with different challenges than you, even those at American Fork - those who have challenges mentally and physically. I have an idea that there are going to be people in that Utah State Prison who will hear from him. I am sure that he would encourage us at this Christmastime to make it a point to be friendly with an unfriendly neighbor, and I can hear him say, "The only unfriendly neighbors we have are those that we do not know very well." I think we will find him going to the hospital, writing letters to missionaries who do not have parents, calling on those who are widows and those who have tragedy come. These are the measures of greatness that we find in this wonderful man.</p>
<p>Again, let me thank you for the opportunity of being with you. I leave you my witness at this time of year that Jesus is the Christ and that God lives, and he knows you, and he wants to hear from you. These things I declare humbly and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Shortly after accepting my job at BYU, I called Elder Jeffrey R. Hollands office to ask if he would do the voice-over for an athletics commercial during the height of Jimmermania. Because of my football career I had gotten to know Elder Holland, and I thought he would be the perfect person, with his distinctive voice, for the job.
Then I had a meeting with Tom Holmoe, BYUs athletic director, and I let him know how excited I was about the possibility of including Elder Holland in our project. I naively assumed that Tom would be thrilled about my phone call and invitation.
I was wrong. It was a major faux pas. He let me know that any invitation to one of the leaders of the Church needed to go through the president of the school. I quickly wrote an apology to President Samuelson, and this was his inspiring reply:
Chad,
No need to worry. We sometimes forget to inform those coming into BYU employment of the unique way things are done at BYU, particularly when it relates to contacts and requests of the senior Brethren. You are like those guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom because no one ever taught them the gospel. We probably should not take this one up the line, but feel free to raise any good ideas you have. Sorry we didnt loop you in earlier. I know Elder Hollands only concern would be disappointing you. Know that you are loved and appreciated. All the best.
Cec
I love that letter. It is a shining example of my topic today: "The World Needs to See and Feel Your Light." What does President Samuelsons letter, with his good-natured correction for me, have to do with this theme? Everything! How do you think it made me feel as a new BYU employee to receive that letter? It inspired me. He didnt crush me with his authority; it was just the opposite. I could feel his light and the love he had for me.
As I share my thoughts with you today, I hope to better prepare you for tomorrow. Many of you will run your own companies. You may hold positions of leadership. You would be wise to follow President Samuelsons great example of how to correct and inspire others.
President Samuelson has tried to respond to every email from every student. Think of the encouragement and faith that he has shared with you and other students over the last eleven years. He has certainly followed the counsel of the Savior to let his light shine. He and Sister Samuelson are awesome, and I will miss my association with them. President Kevin Worthen and his wife, Peggy, will likewise win your hearts and earn your respect as they serve you. I know President Worthen and have complete confidence in him.
Our Savior Jesus Christ said, "Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 12:16). That is my favorite scripture. Let your light shine.
When President Thomas S.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a glorious sight you are! Its an honor, my young friends, to be here with you. I feel the tremendous weight of the responsibility which is mine to provide you with a message which will hopefully be helpful to you not only for today but, indeed, throughout your lives.
As I gaze at this vast audience, Im reminded that each of you is one of a kind. Each has had experiences unique to you and you alone. You have come to Brigham Young University from locations across the country and the world. You come from varied backgrounds. And yet there is much that we have in common one with another. We know where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we leave this life. We know that we are children of our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. We know we want to return to Him after we leave this earthly existence. We know that what we do - and dont do - here in mortality is of utmost importance. We also know that, should we fall short, our Savior has provided us with the precious gift of the Atonement and that, if we change our lives and our hearts and take advantage of the power of the Atonement, our sins and shortcomings will be forgiven and forgotten.
We have in common the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we know it is our responsibility to share the truths of the gospel with others. One of the chief ways in which we can share the gospel is to be a righteous example, and it is about this that I wish to speak to you today. The Apostle Paul admonished, "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."1 He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be "as lights in the world."2
This is what I would hope for each of us - that we might be a light to the world.
What is light? Websters dictionary lists no less than fifteen definitions for the noun light. I prefer the simple "something that illuminates." Just as turning on a light switch in a dark room will bathe the room in light, so providing an example of righteousness - and therefore being a light - can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.
Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. Said President Harold B. Lee:
Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God - that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed. Moroni spoke of [that light,] that Spirit when he said:
"For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. And, I have to say, you are an awesome sight! My oldest daughter, Mackenzie, is graduating today, so I am especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy our family experiences through having children attend BYU.
Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:
I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually. ["Your Gifts Bless Generations," insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]
I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I hope you feel that as well.
Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed many tests - some academic and some in other aspects of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.
It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when
Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. "It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, What have I done? and, What do I do now?" he recalls. "I found myself on my knees within minutes."
Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD 78). Edwards set a chair directly in front of Mendenhalls chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.
"[LaVell Edwards] first words were You have a tough job. Then there was a pause and silence," says Mendenhall. "It wasnt very comforting to hear that. But then [LaVell] just said, But its a great job. I didnt know what he meant by either at the time."
Mendenhall has come to consider [Coach] Edwards a mentor and an advocate. "Its nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what its like to be a head coach here." The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be. [Peter B. Gardner, "The Bronco Way," BYU Magazine, winter 2007, 2223]
Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, co</span>

Perhaps you would also like to know, if you dont already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monsons close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because Im sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, Id like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didnt know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions a</span>
