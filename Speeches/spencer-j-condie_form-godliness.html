  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="The late Samuel Johnson once said, "Theres nothing like an imminent hanging to concentrate the mind upon a single idea!" For the past several weeks my mind has focused upon a central theme which I would like to share with you today. Inasmuch as speakers generally learn more than listeners, I need to improve my life in a number of ways, so Ive chosen to speak to the topic "Having a Form of Godliness."

Above the desk in my office are a number of photographs which are very significant to me. One of them is a picture of the Provo Temple taken at night. The illuminated golden spire of that temple is a light upon a hill which cannot be hid (see Matthew 5:14). When I look at that photo, I behold a beautiful building with unpretentious architectural lines. But within the walls of that temple, ordinances are performed which have eternal significance. Indeed, the lives of millions in an unseen world have been forever influenced by the ordinances performed therein. Instruction is given which provides us with an eternal blueprint, a spiritual life-script which, if followed carefully, will help us return to the presence of a loving Heavenly Father. I keep this photo nearby to remind me of covenants I have renewed in that holy place.

Beneath the picture of the Provo Temple is a photograph of another building, an edifice embellished with nearly every imaginable form of ornamentation. This building is a virtual temple of art, the Vienna Museum of Art History. I keep this photograph near to remind me of some wonderful experiences which my family and the family of Professors Garold and Norma Davis, and 30 beautiful, inquisitive BYU students had in Austria just a year ago. This massive, ornate structure adorned in a neo-Baroque style houses more than a thousand of the worlds greatest paintings and other works of art. In many respects it embodies much that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Thirteenth Article of Faith). Even devoid of its masterworks, this building would be a work of art in its own right. The grandeur of its architectural symmetry, its beautifully sculptured marble columns, and its ornate ceilings evoke feelings of awe and appreciation for the talents of the builders and those who gave of their means to help construct this beautiful building.

On one occasion as I visited this inspiring museum, I reflected upon the words of the Savior to a boy prophet in the spring of 1820:

&lt;i&gt;They draw near to me with their lips . . . having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.&lt;/i&gt; [Joseph Smith 2:19; see 2 Timothy 3:5]

Each time I revisited this museum or a concert hall or the famous Vienna State Opera House, I felt inspired by the talents of others, all of whom lived as best they could within the light theyd been given. But in each of these buildings returned the reverberating theme "[they have] a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof."

And then, suddenly, I was struck with a three-hundred kilovolt question: Its wonderful that you belong to a Church which has a form of godliness and also the power thereof, but what of you and your &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; life? Bibbed and tuckered in your white shirt and Sunday suit, with your spit-shined shoes and your missionary haircut, Brother Condie, do you perhaps sometimes have a &lt;i&gt;form&lt;/i&gt; of godliness, but does your personal life really reflect the &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt; of the priesthood of God?

Like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas Eve, I felt a pallor of gloom sweep my soul as I reflected upon the many times I had exercised my priesthood unworthily and the times I had partaken of the sacrament without sincere intentions of renewing covenants. I retrieved painful memories of having reproved others many times with sharpness without having been moved upon by the Holy Ghost (see D&amp;amp;C 121:43). I recalled the conscience-wracking consequences of covering my sins in an interview when the bishop asked me just one question: "Have you been a good kid lately?" I replied yes, but in my heart I knew, and I knew the Lord knew, that a more careful interview would have yielded some soul-searching signs of wavering worthiness.

Brothers and sisters, for one of the few times in my life, I gained a glimpse into the depths of my own soul, and I didnt like everything I saw. Like Enos, the son of Jacob, I have observed through personal experience the egocentricity of sin. As Enos went hunting and his soul began to hunger for the things of the Spirit, his first recorded thoughts were upon his &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; soul. It was not until he had prayed all day long and into the night and had received a confirmation of forgiveness of his &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; sins that his thoughts were turned to his brethren, the Nephites, and then to the Lamanites (see Enos).

Through personal experience I have found that when one does not have the Spirit of the Lord, any service within the Church becomes extremely arduous. Perhaps David described the predicament best when he wrote in Psalm 88:15, "While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted." One of the Brethren described this phenomenon as "going through life serving the Lord in such a way as not to offend the devil."

On the other hand, when our spirits are in tune, the powers of heaven can and do distill upon us, drenching us with joy in serving the Lord through service to others. It is then that our confidence waxes strong before God and the Holy Ghost becomes our constant companion (see D&amp;amp;C 121:4546).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;King David&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There are few examples more poignant than the life of King David in illustrating the corrosion of confidence in the sight of the Lord. As a naive shepherd boy whose thoughts were garnished with virtue, filled with faith and confidence, he slew Goliath while his compatriots cowered in the background. As a poet-king, anointed to that position under the hands of the prophet Samuel, he exemplified a form of godliness as he wrote of green pastures, still waters, and paths of righteousness. Filled with faith he humbly, yet confidently, proclaimed:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.&lt;/i&gt; [Psalms 23:4, emphasis added]

In his very next recorded psalm he asserted that those who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord must have "clean hands, and a pure heart" (Psalms, 24:34).

But some time later, after becoming the king of all Israel, David, the shepherd boy grown tall, "lifted up his soul into vanity"; and, following the lusts of a heart no longer pure, he committed a sin for which forgiveness is difficult, and then compounded it by covertly committing an even greater sin.

The psalms of David provide us with an excellent barometer of his spirituality just as our own personal journals reflect our own spiritual strengths and weaknesses. Thus, it is of interest to read Davids journal entry shortly after his encounter with Bathsheba. Wracked with unrelenting remorse he wrote in Psalm 51:

&lt;i&gt;Have mercy upon me, O God . . . blot out my transgressions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.&lt;/i&gt; [vss. 1, 11]

No longer possessed of faith which fears no evil, Davids green pastures had become deserts of despair. Without divine guidance, how was he now going to lead Israel and defend her borders? In 1 Chronicles 21, we learn that Satan placed in Davids heart the desire to take a census of all his people. His chief commander, Joab, was a bit distressed at Davids request, for had not God always helped his chosen people in battle, regardless of their numbers? Hadnt Jehovah trimmed Gideons troops from 32,000 to 300 to prove that it was the Lords power and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; sheer numbers which was responsible for the victory over the Midianites? (see Judges 7). Had not David the shephard boy been a majority of one in single-handedly defeating the Goliath-led Philistines? Little wonder that Joab questioned the kings sudden striving to find safety in numbers.

President Harold B. Lee, upon becoming the prophet of the Church in July 1972, said:

&lt;i&gt;The safety of the Church lies in the members keeping the commandments.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Church News,&lt;/i&gt; 15 July 1972, p. 3]

And what of the safety of a nation? Is our nation any less exempt from the blessings of obedience and the consequences of disobedience? Were the matter not so serious, I could chuckle at the similarities between Davids census of the Israelites and our own nations compulsive counting of nuclear warheads. How many missiles does it take to protect a nation in which abortion is currently the most frequently performed operation in hospitals and clinics throughout the land? (see &lt;i&gt;Statistical Abstracts of the United States,&lt;/i&gt; Washington, D.C., U. S. Department of Commerce, 1980, pp. 6971). Is national security possible for a country whose citizens are addicted by the millions to movies, magazines, and television programs which vividly portray Satans smutty smorgasbord on a daily basis? In my humble view, parity in nuclear numbers may numb our fears, but it is a sad substitute for spiritual strength and security.

Sometimes, even within the Church, an undue concern with numbers can impair human relationships as people become pawns in a quantitative quest for perfection. But what of &lt;i&gt;qualitative&lt;/i&gt; perfection? Do our statistical reports sometimes have a &lt;i&gt;form&lt;/i&gt; of godliness devoid of godly power? Elder Dean L. Larsen reminds us that

&lt;i&gt;the qualities of the spirit are susceptible to assessment, but they must be assessed by spiritual means&lt;/i&gt; [Dean L. Larsen "Some Thoughts on Goal-Setting," &lt;i&gt;Ensign&lt;/i&gt;, February 1981, pp. 6265]

Pauls counsel to the Corinthians may be helpful to us in this regard. Said Paul:

&lt;i&gt;The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Corinthians 3:6]

I suppose the secular equivalent to this statement is the observation of Roy Frances that "too much rigor often leads to mortis."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Means and Goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I make no claim to being a theologian, but with my limited knowledge and perspective, it appears to me that in the eternal economy of things, the methods we use to achieve our eternal goals are often as important as the goals themselves.

In the fourth chapter of Moses we learn of the council in heaven wherein Satan proposed what appears to be a very laudable goal:

&lt;i&gt;I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 4:1]

Now, what could possibly be wrong with such a lofty goal, to absolutely assure eternal salvation to all mankind? The Lord himself answered this question:

&lt;i&gt;Because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, . . . I caused that he should be cast down.&lt;/i&gt; [Moses 4:3]

In other words, exaltation is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be purchased by the surrender of ones free agency, but rather through the Atonement and "by grace after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). This latter step involves the proper use of our free agency, not its enforcement by others.

In the fourth chapter of Ephesians the apostle Paul explained that the Church was organized (Ephesians 4:11) "for the perfecting of the saints" (Ephesians 4:12). And how is this perfecting process to proceed? By "speaking the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15).

Alma gave his son, Shiblon, similar advice prior to his departure to win souls for the kingdom. Said Alma:

&lt;i&gt;Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 38:12]

As we continually contemplate this vital relationship between mortal means and eternal goals, it may be well to reflect upon the fact that the Savior called Peter and Andrew to become "&lt;i&gt;fishers &lt;/i&gt;of men" (Matthew 4:19), &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; hunters. Whereas hunters pursue their quarry, assailing it with slings and arrows, the fishers of man are to use the methods of "persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41). It is well to remember also that when we are fishing, the fish must take some of the initiative in order to swim into the net, and therein one finds an eternal meaning in ones life within the gospel net.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday Neurosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In his book &lt;i&gt;Mans Search for Meaning,&lt;/i&gt; the Viennese psychiatrist Viktor Frankl discusses individuals whose lives have no sense of meaning. He refers to this empty feeling or existential vacuum as a "Sunday neurosis," a kind of depression

&lt;i&gt;which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest.&lt;/i&gt; [New York: Pocket Books, 1963, p. 169]

In other words, who are we and what are we on Sundays when we dont go to work to perform the roles of accountant, electrician, truck driver, beautician, or nurse? Or who are we after we have been released as bishop or Relief Society president or elders quorum president? Or, with the new consolidated meeting schedule, who are we on Sundays when were not in church? Is the Sabbath a day of spiritual regeneration or one of emptiness and boredom, devoid of celestial content?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday Nostalgia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One Sunday this past spring I emerged from a priests quorum meeting in one of the wards in our stake. I had been touched by the lesson given to a pride of prospective missionaries, young lions preparing to preach the gospel. The advisers quiet, yet firm, testimony reminded me once again that the gospel &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; is true. As I journeyed home that day, I felt no Sunday neurosis; it was more of a feeling of Sabbath nostalgia, a sense of longing for a celestial home. As I drove homeward, a familiar message found expression in song:

&lt;i&gt;Yet ofttimes a secret something&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Whispered, "Youre a stranger here."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And I felt that I had wandered&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;From a more exalted sphere.&lt;/i&gt;
[Eliza R. Snow, &lt;i&gt;Hymns&lt;/i&gt;, no. 139]

Our beloved prophet, President Kimball, has given us the solution to resolving feelings of emptiness in our lives:

&lt;i&gt;When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves. In the midst of serving, there is the promise of Jesus, that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves &lt;/i&gt;(see Matthew 10:39). . . .

&lt;i&gt;The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways, the more substance there is to our souls. . . . Indeed, it is easier to "find" ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!&lt;/i&gt; ["Small Acts of Service," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; December 1974, p. 2]

I hope those of you who are on a diet will take the figurative meaning of that statement.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serious but Not Hopeless&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Viennese social critic, Karl Kraus, wrote a biting satire on the glorification of war in his play &lt;i&gt;The Last Days of Mankind&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Die letzten Tage der Menschheit,&lt;/i&gt; Vienna, 1922). At the outbreak of World War I, Kraus described the situation in Berlin as "serious but not hopeless, whereas in Vienna things are hopeless but not serious."

The Viennese took their operas and their arts very seriously. In the kaffee houses of Vienna, fighting was not uncommon. And what was the source of these heated debates? Whether Wagner was a greater composer than Brahms! But war - that was different. Music should be taken seriously, but not war. That was a matter of pomp and glory and good, heroic fun. Little mention was made of death and destruction. "It was perhaps the only instance in history of an army that went off to war and never came back" (Richard Rickett, &lt;i&gt;Austrian History,&lt;/i&gt; Vienna: Georg Prachner, 1966, p. 122).

I suspect that sometimes our personal lives are like Vienna. We take the wrong things seriously and make light of sacred covenants which should be taken most seriously. Martin Dubermans description of the "bit" technique illustrates this problem, and I quote:

&lt;i&gt;The "bit" technique goes like this: At all costs one must avoid the stigma of being too serious; to do so, you stick a self-mocking label on any scene in which you might be caught displaying deep emotion. Thus: I dont want to do the "engaged-couple bit," but - or "I dont want to do the "expectant-father bit," but - . Doing "bits" with people is the "in" way of establishing fellowship. They allow one to show affection while ridiculing it, to be sentimental while appearing tough.&lt;/i&gt; [Martin Duberman, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review,&lt;/i&gt; 19 September 1965, pp. 6061]

Perhaps King Saul did the "sacrifice bit" by not taking the word of the prophet Samuel seriously. You will recall that Samuel had commanded Saul to slay all the Amalekites and all their animals. When Saul returned home from battle, Samuel was distraught to discover that Saul had brought several animals back with him, supposedly to sacrifice them upon his arrival home. Saul learned the hard way that "to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (1 Samuel 15:22).

I hope you youth of Zion will not engage in the "dress-standards bit" or the "missionary bit" or the "temple-marriage bit" or any other "bits" which may have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. When we make covenants in the temple of the Lord, they are to be valid for time and all eternity - period.

Consider the following practices, some of which have a form of godliness and some of which have both the form and the power:

Do we appreciate the difference between fasting and skipping breakfast?

Is there a crucial distinction in our lives between praying and saying prayers?

Can we discriminate between music which edifies and that which debases? The amplification of three basic guitar cords through sixteen-inch speakers still begs the question of whether some music is good and loud or just loud.

Do we appreciate the distinction between consecration and contribution?

Can we discern between obedience based on faith and obedience based on fear? Elder Theodore M. Burton provided some very interesting insights in this regard, and I quote from his general conference address of 1974:

&lt;i&gt;Some members of the Church have said to me, "Why should we keep a store of food on hand? If a real emergency came in this lawless world, a neighbor would simply come with his gun and take it from us. What would you do if a person came and demanded your food?" I replied that I would share whatever I had with him, and he wouldnt have to use a gun to obtain that assistance either.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"I wouldnt," replied one man. "I have a gun, and I wouldnt hesitate to use it to defend my family. Anyone would have to kill me first in order to get food away from me! After all, they bring their own misery on themselves by not being prepared!"&lt;/i&gt;

Elder Burton, with a twinkle in his eye, continued: "Well, one way to solve this problem is to convert your neighbors to become obedient Latter-day Saints with their own supply of food." ("The Power of Elijah," &lt;i&gt;Ensign&lt;/i&gt;, April 1974, p. 62). I suppose that gunpowder would also keep the boll weevil out of the flour.

Of course, another solution to this "drawbridge mentality" is obedience to the counsel of the Lord: "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear (D&amp;amp;C 38:30) and "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activity vs. Devotion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Can we discern a difference between Church activity and devotion?

It has been interesting to note the extremely widespread use of the words &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inactive&lt;/i&gt; to describe members of the Church. If people show up for most of their meetings, we call them active. On the other hand, if they miss most of their meetings, we label them inactive. Over the years it has been interesting to observe how many so-called "active" Saints seldom contribute to the ward budget or attend the temple or render much help on the welfare farm. By contrast, there are Saints whose neighbors call them "inactive" but who frequent the stake farm and also contribute generously to the ward budget and building fund.

It seems that the words &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inactive&lt;/i&gt; dont adequately capture the dimensions of devotion, consecration, commitment, and godliness. For example, the sons of Eli regularly officiated in the temple despite the fact that they were impure and desecrated the sacrifices of those who had come to worship (1 Samuel 23). By todays statistical standards, they were "active" because they showed up every day.

The importance of discerning the contents beneath the form was brought forcefully home to a shopper in an Austrian supermarket. He was perplexed to observe two cans of mushrooms of identical size with different labels and very discrepant prices. He asked one of the clerks what the difference was between the cans of mushrooms for 13 shillings and the ones for 26 shillings. With a smile, the clerk replied, "The ones for 26 are guaranteed not to be poisonous."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power vs. Form&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There are many organizations and activities which compete for our time, our means, and our loyalty. Many of these are what Robert Bellah ("Civil Religion in America," Daedalus, 1967, pp. 121) calls "civil religion," for they have the form of religion. For example, there are civic organizations and learned societies which have a hierarchical structure complete with high councils. They solicit contributions in proportion to ones income and even hold general conferences. Their purposes are generally lofty, and membership in such organizations is to be encouraged. But after all is said and done, in an eternal perspective, more is often &lt;i&gt;said&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt;, for the priesthood of God is absent from such organizations.

Even as great an organization as the Boy Scouts of America, with its inspiring Scout Law and inspired motto, must recognize that it is the power and authority of the Aaronic Priesthood - not the authority of an Eagle Scout - by which young priests bless sacred emblems.

The training and self-discipline of athletic competition does much to remind us that our bodies are temples for our spirits (1 Corinthians 3:16). For some, however, interest in athletics, either as participant or spectator, takes on a sacred aura which has a form of religious devotion. But what of the power of God? A million-dollar baseball contract pales in comparison to the priesthood promises contained in the oath and covenant found in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants.

As a rabid boxing fan in my high school years, I was dismayed when Gene Fullmer, the "Mormon Mauler," lost his bid to be the middle-weight champion of the world, and I asked my stake patriarch how the Lord could allow Sugar Ray Robinson to beat Gene Fullmer. His reply was succinct, "I dont think the Lord caught the match."

Patriotism, misused and misdirected, may also assume a form of godliness devoid of godly power as we have seen in Ireland and Iran. As we visited the Nazi concentration camp at Mauthausen, our souls were subdued by this memorial to the high costs of hatred and the wreckage of patriotism gone awry. What began with exclusionary ethnic epithets grew into vicious vandalism and eventually ended in mass murder. After that visit, I made a promise, with God as my witness, that I was going to refrain from telling ethnic jokes and that I was going to try harder to substitute charity for criticism. Im still wrestling with that promise.

I fear that many of us, like Saul, are more willing to sacrifice other peoples possessions than to sacrifice our own sins. This was the sacrifice which the father of King Lamoni made when he prayed:

&lt;i&gt;God . . . I will give away all my sins to know thee.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 22:18]

And this kind of sacrifice is precisely the price that must be paid to know him and to enter his presence.

Even King David, in the depths of despair, realized better than Saul, his predecessor, what kind of sacrifices the Lord requires. In Psalm 51 he wrote:

&lt;i&gt;For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart.&lt;/i&gt; [Psalms 51:1617]

I sense that sometimes as Latter-day Saints we are often too ready to sacrifice and too slow to obey. I sometimes question how much of what we call sacrifice really constitutes a sacrifice on our part. For example, if we invest several thousand dollars in long-term savings certificates with the intent of gaining a rich return on our long-term investments, do we ever refer to such investments as a sacrifice? Ive heard of stockbrokers, realtors, and investment counselors, but Ive never heard of sacrificial account executives.

Then what of financial contributions to the kingdom of God? And what of the time we spend in preparing Primary lessons, singing in ward choirs, or taking a troop of Boy Scouts to Camp Poison Sumac for a weeks retreat on the shores of Mosquito Lake? Do these contributions constitute a major sacrifice, or are they eternal investments in a paradisiacal portfolio promising divine dividends that "all that [our] Father hath shall be given unto [us]"? (D&amp;amp;C 84:38).

In section 84 we learn from the words of the Lord that

&lt;i&gt;without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 84:21]

It is in the ordinances of the priesthood, not in numbers, that the power of godliness is manifest. And what of the daughters of Zion who do not hold the priesthood?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motherhood and Priesthood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In the book Priesthood and Church Government, Elder John A. Widtsoe poses a profound question: "Why should God give his sons a power that is denied his daughters? He then proceeds to answer his own question:

&lt;i&gt;This division of responsibility is for a wise and noble purpose. Our Father in Heaven has bestowed upon His daughters a gift of equal importance and power; the "gift" referred to is that of motherhood. Woman may claim other activity, but motherhood should take precedence in her entire scheme of life. . . . Our Father even chose a daughter of Eve to be the earth-mother and guide of His Only Begotten Son, and thus honored womanhood for all time and eternity!&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1963, pp. 8485]

In the divine justice and loving mercy of an omniscient, loving, and wise Heavenly Father, all women will be eligible for the blessings of priesthood ordinances, and those women who are denied the power of motherhood in this life will receive eternal compensation if they remain true and faithful. Of that modern prophets have borne witness (see Harold B. Lee, &lt;i&gt;Ye Are the Light of the World,&lt;/i&gt; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974, p. 292).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Godliness and Perfection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In closing, I should like to speak briefly about the relationship between godliness and perfection. In a fourteen-stake fireside in June of last year, Elder Bruce R. McConkie identified as fallacious the belief that we must be perfect to gain salvation. I was heartened by his address, for I have counseled with many students who have disclosed their distress in having failed to reach perfection by the second semester of their junior year. Or they are discouraged because they failed to return home from a mission perfect. Or they were married in the temple to a "perfect" companion, when they themselves were not perfect. (Those of you who have perfect roommates know what Im talking about.) Elder McConkies statement is true: We will not achieve perfection in this life. The Savior himself is the only one to accomplish this goal upon this earth. But if we are to become as the Savior, and he has commanded us to strive to do just that (see Matthew 5:48, 3 Nephi 12:48), we would do well to follow the admonition of Moroni in the final verses of the Book of Mormon:

&lt;i&gt;Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.&lt;/i&gt; [Moroni 10:32]

The pathway to perfection will always be punctuated with painful and unpleasant events. After all, Lehi instructed Jacob that "it must needs be that there is an opposition in all things." (2 Nephi 2:11). He didnt say "there could be" or "there might be" or even that "there would be" opposition. He said "it &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;needs be that there is an opposition in all things." Opposition is indispensable to the plan of salvation and for the eternal experiences and growth afforded therein.

The pathway to perfection and godhood begins with the acquisition of such godly attributes as those described in section 4: "faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, [and] diligence" (D&amp;amp;C 4:6). In our personal strivings and in assisting those who are lost or faltering to obtain the power of godliness, may we keep in mind the Saviors thrice-given injunction to Peter: "Feed my sheep," "feed my lambs," "feed my sheep." It seems significant to me that the Lord said "&lt;i&gt;Feed&lt;/i&gt; my sheep," not "&lt;i&gt;herd&lt;/i&gt; them." Means are often as important as goals.

It is my prayer that each of us may leave this gathering this day with a firmer resolve to cultivate the attributes of godliness, having both the form of godliness &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the power thereof. Many things in our lives are important but not true. There are other things, unfortunately, that are often true but not important. I bear you my testimony that the restored Church of Jesus Christ is not just true, but important - a matter of spiritual urgency, a matter of eternal life or death. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>The late Samuel Johnson once said, "Theres nothing like an imminent hanging to concentrate the mind upon a single idea!" For the past several weeks my mind has focused upon a central theme which I would like to share with you today. Inasmuch as speakers generally learn more than listeners, I need to improve my life in a number of ways, so Ive chosen to speak to the topic "Having a Form of Godliness."</p>
<p>Above the desk in my office are a number of photographs which are very significant to me. One of them is a picture of the Provo Temple taken at night. The illuminated golden spire of that temple is a light upon a hill which cannot be hid (see Matthew 5:14). When I look at that photo, I behold a beautiful building with unpretentious architectural lines. But within the walls of that temple, ordinances are performed which have eternal significance. Indeed, the lives of millions in an unseen world have been forever influenced by the ordinances performed therein. Instruction is given which provides us with an eternal blueprint, a spiritual life-script which, if followed carefully, will help us return to the presence of a loving Heavenly Father. I keep this photo nearby to remind me of covenants I have renewed in that holy place.</p>
<p>Beneath the picture of the Provo Temple is a photograph of another building, an edifice embellished with nearly every imaginable form of ornamentation. This building is a virtual temple of art, the Vienna Museum of Art History. I keep this photograph near to remind me of some wonderful experiences which my family and the family of Professors Garold and Norma Davis, and 30 beautiful, inquisitive BYU students had in Austria just a year ago. This massive, ornate structure adorned in a neo-Baroque style houses more than a thousand of the worlds greatest paintings and other works of art. In many respects it embodies much that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Thirteenth Article of Faith). Even devoid of its masterworks, this building would be a work of art in its own right. The grandeur of its architectural symmetry, its beautifully sculptured marble columns, and its ornate ceilings evoke feelings of awe and appreciation for the talents of the builders and those who gave of their means to help construct this beautiful building.</p>
<p>On one occasion as I visited this inspiring museum, I reflected upon the words of the Savior to a boy prophet in the spring of 1820:</p>
<p><i>They draw near to me with their lips . . . having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.</i> [Joseph Smith 2:19; see 2 Timothy 3:5]</p>
<p>Each time I revisited this museum or a concert hall or the famous Vienna State Opera House, I felt inspired by the talents of others, all of whom lived as best they could within the light theyd been given. But in each of these buildings returned the reverberating theme "[they have] a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof."</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, I was struck with a three-hundred kilovolt question: Its wonderful that you belong to a Church which has a form of godliness and also the power thereof, but what of you and your <i>personal</i> life? Bibbed and tuckered in your white shirt and Sunday suit, with your spit-shined shoes and your missionary haircut, Brother Condie, do you perhaps sometimes have a <i>form</i> of godliness, but does your personal life really reflect the <i>power</i> of the priesthood of God?</p>
<p>Like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas Eve, I felt a pallor of gloom sweep my soul as I reflected upon the many times I had exercised my priesthood unworthily and the times I had partaken of the sacrament without sincere intentions of renewing covenants. I retrieved painful memories of having reproved others many times with sharpness without having been moved upon by the Holy Ghost (see D&amp;C 121:43). I recalled the conscience-wracking consequences of covering my sins in an interview when the bishop asked me just one question: "Have you been a good kid lately?" I replied yes, but in my heart I knew, and I knew the Lord knew, that a more careful interview would have yielded some soul-searching signs of wavering worthiness.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, for one of the few times in my life, I gained a glimpse into the depths of my own soul, and I didnt like everything I saw. Like Enos, the son of Jacob, I have observed through personal experience the egocentricity of sin. As Enos went hunting and his soul began to hunger for the things of the Spirit, his first recorded thoughts were upon his <i>own</i> soul. It was not until he had prayed all day long and into the night and had received a confirmation of forgiveness of his <i>own</i> sins that his thoughts were turned to his brethren, the Nephites, and then to the Lamanites (see Enos).</p>
<p>Through personal experience I have found that when one does not have the Spirit of the Lord, any service within the Church becomes extremely arduous. Perhaps David described the predicament best when he wrote in Psalm 88:15, "While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted." One of the Brethren described this phenomenon as "going through life serving the Lord in such a way as not to offend the devil."</p>
<p>On the other hand, when our spirits are in tune, the powers of heaven can and do distill upon us, drenching us with joy in serving the Lord through service to others. It is then that our confidence waxes strong before God and the Holy Ghost becomes our constant companion (see D&amp;C 121:4546).</p>
<h2><b>King David</b></h2>
<p>There are few examples more poignant than the life of King David in illustrating the corrosion of confidence in the sight of the Lord. As a naive shepherd boy whose thoughts were garnished with virtue, filled with faith and confidence, he slew Goliath while his compatriots cowered in the background. As a poet-king, anointed to that position under the hands of the prophet Samuel, he exemplified a form of godliness as he wrote of green pastures, still waters, and paths of righteousness. Filled with faith he humbly, yet confidently, proclaimed:</p>
<p><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i> [Psalms 23:4, emphasis added]</p>
<p>In his very next recorded psalm he asserted that those who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord must have "clean hands, and a pure heart" (Psalms, 24:34).</p>
<p>But some time later, after becoming the king of all Israel, David, the shepherd boy grown tall, "lifted up his soul into vanity"; and, following the lusts of a heart no longer pure, he committed a sin for which forgiveness is difficult, and then compounded it by covertly committing an even greater sin.</p>
<p>The psalms of David provide us with an excellent barometer of his spirituality just as our own personal journals reflect our own spiritual strengths and weaknesses. Thus, it is of interest to read Davids journal entry shortly after his encounter with Bathsheba. Wracked with unrelenting remorse he wrote in Psalm 51:</p>
<p><i>Have mercy upon me, O God . . . blot out my transgressions.</i></p>
<p><i>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</i> [vss. 1, 11]</p>
<p>No longer possessed of faith which fears no evil, Davids green pastures had become deserts of despair. Without divine guidance, how was he now going to lead Israel and defend her borders? In 1 Chronicles 21, we learn that Satan placed in Davids heart the desire to take a census of all his people. His chief commander, Joab, was a bit distressed at Davids request, for had not God always helped his chosen people in battle, regardless of their numbers? Hadnt Jehovah trimmed Gideons troops from 32,000 to 300 to prove that it was the Lords power and <i>not</i> sheer numbers which was responsible for the victory over the Midianites? (see Judges 7). Had not David the shephard boy been a majority of one in single-handedly defeating the Goliath-led Philistines? Little wonder that Joab questioned the kings sudden striving to find safety in numbers.</p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee, upon becoming the prophet of the Church in July 1972, said:</p>
<p><i>The safety of the Church lies in the members keeping the commandments.</i> [<i>Church News,</i> 15 July 1972, p. 3]</p>
<p>And what of the safety of a nation? Is our nation any less exempt from the blessings of obedience and the consequences of disobedience? Were the matter not so serious, I could chuckle at the similarities between Davids census of the Israelites and our own nations compulsive counting of nuclear warheads. How many missiles does it take to protect a nation in which abortion is currently the most frequently performed operation in hospitals and clinics throughout the land? (see <i>Statistical Abstracts of the United States,</i> Washington, D.C., U. S. Department of Commerce, 1980, pp. 6971). Is national security possible for a country whose citizens are addicted by the millions to movies, magazines, and television programs which vividly portray Satans smutty smorgasbord on a daily basis? In my humble view, parity in nuclear numbers may numb our fears, but it is a sad substitute for spiritual strength and security.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even within the Church, an undue concern with numbers can impair human relationships as people become pawns in a quantitative quest for perfection. But what of <i>qualitative</i> perfection? Do our statistical reports sometimes have a <i>form</i> of godliness devoid of godly power? Elder Dean L. Larsen reminds us that</p>
<p><i>the qualities of the spirit are susceptible to assessment, but they must be assessed by spiritual means</i> [Dean L. Larsen "Some Thoughts on Goal-Setting," <i>Ensign</i>, February 1981, pp. 6265]</p>
<p>Pauls counsel to the Corinthians may be helpful to us in this regard. Said Paul:</p>
<p><i>The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. </i>[2 Corinthians 3:6]</p>
<p>I suppose the secular equivalent to this statement is the observation of Roy Frances that "too much rigor often leads to mortis."</p>
<h2><b>Means and Goals</b></h2>
<p>I make no claim to being a theologian, but with my limited knowledge and perspective, it appears to me that in the eternal economy of things, the methods we use to achieve our eternal goals are often as important as the goals themselves.</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter of Moses we learn of the council in heaven wherein Satan proposed what appears to be a very laudable goal:</p>
<p><i>I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it.</i> [Moses 4:1]</p>
<p>Now, what could possibly be wrong with such a lofty goal, to absolutely assure eternal salvation to all mankind? The Lord himself answered this question:</p>
<p><i>Because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, . . . I caused that he should be cast down.</i> [Moses 4:3]</p>
<p>In other words, exaltation is <i>not</i> to be purchased by the surrender of ones free agency, but rather through the Atonement and "by grace after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). This latter step involves the proper use of our free agency, not its enforcement by others.</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter of Ephesians the apostle Paul explained that the Church was organized (Ephesians 4:11) "for the perfecting of the saints" (Ephesians 4:12). And how is this perfecting process to proceed? By "speaking the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15).</p>
<p>Alma gave his son, Shiblon, similar advice prior to his departure to win souls for the kingdom. Said Alma:</p>
<p><i>Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions.</i> [Alma 38:12]</p>
<p>As we continually contemplate this vital relationship between mortal means and eternal goals, it may be well to reflect upon the fact that the Savior called Peter and Andrew to become "<i>fishers </i>of men" (Matthew 4:19), <i>not</i> hunters. Whereas hunters pursue their quarry, assailing it with slings and arrows, the fishers of man are to use the methods of "persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned" (D&amp;C 121:41). It is well to remember also that when we are fishing, the fish must take some of the initiative in order to swim into the net, and therein one finds an eternal meaning in ones life within the gospel net.</p>
<h2><b>Sunday Neurosis</b></h2>
<p>In his book <i>Mans Search for Meaning,</i> the Viennese psychiatrist Viktor Frankl discusses individuals whose lives have no sense of meaning. He refers to this empty feeling or existential vacuum as a "Sunday neurosis," a kind of depression</p>
<p><i>which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest.</i> [New York: Pocket Books, 1963, p. 169]</p>
<p>In other words, who are we and what are we on Sundays when we dont go to work to perform the roles of accountant, electrician, truck driver, beautician, or nurse? Or who are we after we have been released as bishop or Relief Society president or elders quorum president? Or, with the new consolidated meeting schedule, who are we on Sundays when were not in church? Is the Sabbath a day of spiritual regeneration or one of emptiness and boredom, devoid of celestial content?</p>
<h2><b>Sunday Nostalgia</b></h2>
<p>One Sunday this past spring I emerged from a priests quorum meeting in one of the wards in our stake. I had been touched by the lesson given to a pride of prospective missionaries, young lions preparing to preach the gospel. The advisers quiet, yet firm, testimony reminded me once again that the gospel <i>really</i> is true. As I journeyed home that day, I felt no Sunday neurosis; it was more of a feeling of Sabbath nostalgia, a sense of longing for a celestial home. As I drove homeward, a familiar message found expression in song:</p>
<p><i>Yet ofttimes a secret something</i><br />
<i>Whispered, "Youre a stranger here."</i><br />
<i>And I felt that I had wandered</i><br />
<i>From a more exalted sphere.</i><br />
[Eliza R. Snow, <i>Hymns</i>, no. 139]</p>
<p>Our beloved prophet, President Kimball, has given us the solution to resolving feelings of emptiness in our lives:</p>
<p><i>When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves. In the midst of serving, there is the promise of Jesus, that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves </i>(see Matthew 10:39). . . .</p>
<p><i>The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways, the more substance there is to our souls. . . . Indeed, it is easier to "find" ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!</i> ["Small Acts of Service," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1974, p. 2]</p>
<p>I hope those of you who are on a diet will take the figurative meaning of that statement.</p>
<h2><b>Serious but Not Hopeless</b></h2>
<p>The Viennese social critic, Karl Kraus, wrote a biting satire on the glorification of war in his play <i>The Last Days of Mankind</i> (<i>Die letzten Tage der Menschheit,</i> Vienna, 1922). At the outbreak of World War I, Kraus described the situation in Berlin as "serious but not hopeless, whereas in Vienna things are hopeless but not serious."</p>
<p>The Viennese took their operas and their arts very seriously. In the kaffee houses of Vienna, fighting was not uncommon. And what was the source of these heated debates? Whether Wagner was a greater composer than Brahms! But war - that was different. Music should be taken seriously, but not war. That was a matter of pomp and glory and good, heroic fun. Little mention was made of death and destruction. "It was perhaps the only instance in history of an army that went off to war and never came back" (Richard Rickett, <i>Austrian History,</i> Vienna: Georg Prachner, 1966, p. 122).</p>
<p>I suspect that sometimes our personal lives are like Vienna. We take the wrong things seriously and make light of sacred covenants which should be taken most seriously. Martin Dubermans description of the "bit" technique illustrates this problem, and I quote:</p>
<p><i>The "bit" technique goes like this: At all costs one must avoid the stigma of being too serious; to do so, you stick a self-mocking label on any scene in which you might be caught displaying deep emotion. Thus: I dont want to do the "engaged-couple bit," but - or "I dont want to do the "expectant-father bit," but - . Doing "bits" with people is the "in" way of establishing fellowship. They allow one to show affection while ridiculing it, to be sentimental while appearing tough.</i> [Martin Duberman, <i>New York Times Book Review,</i> 19 September 1965, pp. 6061]</p>
<p>Perhaps King Saul did the "sacrifice bit" by not taking the word of the prophet Samuel seriously. You will recall that Samuel had commanded Saul to slay all the Amalekites and all their animals. When Saul returned home from battle, Samuel was distraught to discover that Saul had brought several animals back with him, supposedly to sacrifice them upon his arrival home. Saul learned the hard way that "to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (1 Samuel 15:22).</p>
<p>I hope you youth of Zion will not engage in the "dress-standards bit" or the "missionary bit" or the "temple-marriage bit" or any other "bits" which may have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. When we make covenants in the temple of the Lord, they are to be valid for time and all eternity - period.</p>
<p>Consider the following practices, some of which have a form of godliness and some of which have both the form and the power:</p>
<p>Do we appreciate the difference between fasting and skipping breakfast?</p>
<p>Is there a crucial distinction in our lives between praying and saying prayers?</p>
<p>Can we discriminate between music which edifies and that which debases? The amplification of three basic guitar cords through sixteen-inch speakers still begs the question of whether some music is good and loud or just loud.</p>
<p>Do we appreciate the distinction between consecration and contribution?</p>
<p>Can we discern between obedience based on faith and obedience based on fear? Elder Theodore M. Burton provided some very interesting insights in this regard, and I quote from his general conference address of 1974:</p>
<p><i>Some members of the Church have said to me, "Why should we keep a store of food on hand? If a real emergency came in this lawless world, a neighbor would simply come with his gun and take it from us. What would you do if a person came and demanded your food?" I replied that I would share whatever I had with him, and he wouldnt have to use a gun to obtain that assistance either.</i></p>
<p><i>"I wouldnt," replied one man. "I have a gun, and I wouldnt hesitate to use it to defend my family. Anyone would have to kill me first in order to get food away from me! After all, they bring their own misery on themselves by not being prepared!"</i></p>
<p>Elder Burton, with a twinkle in his eye, continued: "Well, one way to solve this problem is to convert your neighbors to become obedient Latter-day Saints with their own supply of food." ("The Power of Elijah," <i>Ensign</i>, April 1974, p. 62). I suppose that gunpowder would also keep the boll weevil out of the flour.</p>
<p>Of course, another solution to this "drawbridge mentality" is obedience to the counsel of the Lord: "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear (D&amp;C 38:30) and "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).</p>
<h2><b>Activity vs. Devotion</b></h2>
<p>Can we discern a difference between Church activity and devotion?</p>
<p>It has been interesting to note the extremely widespread use of the words <i>active</i> and <i>inactive</i> to describe members of the Church. If people show up for most of their meetings, we call them active. On the other hand, if they miss most of their meetings, we label them inactive. Over the years it has been interesting to observe how many so-called "active" Saints seldom contribute to the ward budget or attend the temple or render much help on the welfare farm. By contrast, there are Saints whose neighbors call them "inactive" but who frequent the stake farm and also contribute generously to the ward budget and building fund.</p>
<p>It seems that the words <i>active</i> and <i>inactive</i> dont adequately capture the dimensions of devotion, consecration, commitment, and godliness. For example, the sons of Eli regularly officiated in the temple despite the fact that they were impure and desecrated the sacrifices of those who had come to worship (1 Samuel 23). By todays statistical standards, they were "active" because they showed up every day.</p>
<p>The importance of discerning the contents beneath the form was brought forcefully home to a shopper in an Austrian supermarket. He was perplexed to observe two cans of mushrooms of identical size with different labels and very discrepant prices. He asked one of the clerks what the difference was between the cans of mushrooms for 13 shillings and the ones for 26 shillings. With a smile, the clerk replied, "The ones for 26 are guaranteed not to be poisonous."</p>
<h2><b>Power vs. Form</b></h2>
<p>There are many organizations and activities which compete for our time, our means, and our loyalty. Many of these are what Robert Bellah ("Civil Religion in America," Daedalus, 1967, pp. 121) calls "civil religion," for they have the form of religion. For example, there are civic organizations and learned societies which have a hierarchical structure complete with high councils. They solicit contributions in proportion to ones income and even hold general conferences. Their purposes are generally lofty, and membership in such organizations is to be encouraged. But after all is said and done, in an eternal perspective, more is often <i>said</i> than <i>done</i>, for the priesthood of God is absent from such organizations.</p>
<p>Even as great an organization as the Boy Scouts of America, with its inspiring Scout Law and inspired motto, must recognize that it is the power and authority of the Aaronic Priesthood - not the authority of an Eagle Scout - by which young priests bless sacred emblems.</p>
<p>The training and self-discipline of athletic competition does much to remind us that our bodies are temples for our spirits (1 Corinthians 3:16). For some, however, interest in athletics, either as participant or spectator, takes on a sacred aura which has a form of religious devotion. But what of the power of God? A million-dollar baseball contract pales in comparison to the priesthood promises contained in the oath and covenant found in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>As a rabid boxing fan in my high school years, I was dismayed when Gene Fullmer, the "Mormon Mauler," lost his bid to be the middle-weight champion of the world, and I asked my stake patriarch how the Lord could allow Sugar Ray Robinson to beat Gene Fullmer. His reply was succinct, "I dont think the Lord caught the match."</p>
<p>Patriotism, misused and misdirected, may also assume a form of godliness devoid of godly power as we have seen in Ireland and Iran. As we visited the Nazi concentration camp at Mauthausen, our souls were subdued by this memorial to the high costs of hatred and the wreckage of patriotism gone awry. What began with exclusionary ethnic epithets grew into vicious vandalism and eventually ended in mass murder. After that visit, I made a promise, with God as my witness, that I was going to refrain from telling ethnic jokes and that I was going to try harder to substitute charity for criticism. Im still wrestling with that promise.</p>
<p>I fear that many of us, like Saul, are more willing to sacrifice other peoples possessions than to sacrifice our own sins. This was the sacrifice which the father of King Lamoni made when he prayed:</p>
<p><i>God . . . I will give away all my sins to know thee.</i> [Alma 22:18]</p>
<p>And this kind of sacrifice is precisely the price that must be paid to know him and to enter his presence.</p>
<p>Even King David, in the depths of despair, realized better than Saul, his predecessor, what kind of sacrifices the Lord requires. In Psalm 51 he wrote:</p>
<p><i>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</i></p>
<p><i>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart.</i> [Psalms 51:1617]</p>
<p>I sense that sometimes as Latter-day Saints we are often too ready to sacrifice and too slow to obey. I sometimes question how much of what we call sacrifice really constitutes a sacrifice on our part. For example, if we invest several thousand dollars in long-term savings certificates with the intent of gaining a rich return on our long-term investments, do we ever refer to such investments as a sacrifice? Ive heard of stockbrokers, realtors, and investment counselors, but Ive never heard of sacrificial account executives.</p>
<p>Then what of financial contributions to the kingdom of God? And what of the time we spend in preparing Primary lessons, singing in ward choirs, or taking a troop of Boy Scouts to Camp Poison Sumac for a weeks retreat on the shores of Mosquito Lake? Do these contributions constitute a major sacrifice, or are they eternal investments in a paradisiacal portfolio promising divine dividends that "all that [our] Father hath shall be given unto [us]"? (D&amp;C 84:38).</p>
<p>In section 84 we learn from the words of the Lord that</p>
<p><i>without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.</i> [D&amp;C 84:21]</p>
<p>It is in the ordinances of the priesthood, not in numbers, that the power of godliness is manifest. And what of the daughters of Zion who do not hold the priesthood?</p>
<h2><b>Motherhood and Priesthood</b></h2>
<p>In the book Priesthood and Church Government, Elder John A. Widtsoe poses a profound question: "Why should God give his sons a power that is denied his daughters? He then proceeds to answer his own question:</p>
<p><i>This division of responsibility is for a wise and noble purpose. Our Father in Heaven has bestowed upon His daughters a gift of equal importance and power; the "gift" referred to is that of motherhood. Woman may claim other activity, but motherhood should take precedence in her entire scheme of life. . . . Our Father even chose a daughter of Eve to be the earth-mother and guide of His Only Begotten Son, and thus honored womanhood for all time and eternity!</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1963, pp. 8485]</p>
<p>In the divine justice and loving mercy of an omniscient, loving, and wise Heavenly Father, all women will be eligible for the blessings of priesthood ordinances, and those women who are denied the power of motherhood in this life will receive eternal compensation if they remain true and faithful. Of that modern prophets have borne witness (see Harold B. Lee, <i>Ye Are the Light of the World,</i> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974, p. 292).</p>
<h2><b>Godliness and Perfection</b></h2>
<p>In closing, I should like to speak briefly about the relationship between godliness and perfection. In a fourteen-stake fireside in June of last year, Elder Bruce R. McConkie identified as fallacious the belief that we must be perfect to gain salvation. I was heartened by his address, for I have counseled with many students who have disclosed their distress in having failed to reach perfection by the second semester of their junior year. Or they are discouraged because they failed to return home from a mission perfect. Or they were married in the temple to a "perfect" companion, when they themselves were not perfect. (Those of you who have perfect roommates know what Im talking about.) Elder McConkies statement is true: We will not achieve perfection in this life. The Savior himself is the only one to accomplish this goal upon this earth. But if we are to become as the Savior, and he has commanded us to strive to do just that (see Matthew 5:48, 3 Nephi 12:48), we would do well to follow the admonition of Moroni in the final verses of the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p><i>Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i> [Moroni 10:32]</p>
<p>The pathway to perfection will always be punctuated with painful and unpleasant events. After all, Lehi instructed Jacob that "it must needs be that there is an opposition in all things." (2 Nephi 2:11). He didnt say "there could be" or "there might be" or even that "there would be" opposition. He said "it <i>must </i>needs be that there is an opposition in all things." Opposition is indispensable to the plan of salvation and for the eternal experiences and growth afforded therein.</p>
<p>The pathway to perfection and godhood begins with the acquisition of such godly attributes as those described in section 4: "faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, [and] diligence" (D&amp;C 4:6). In our personal strivings and in assisting those who are lost or faltering to obtain the power of godliness, may we keep in mind the Saviors thrice-given injunction to Peter: "Feed my sheep," "feed my lambs," "feed my sheep." It seems significant to me that the Lord said "<i>Feed</i> my sheep," not "<i>herd</i> them." Means are often as important as goals.</p>
<p>It is my prayer that each of us may leave this gathering this day with a firmer resolve to cultivate the attributes of godliness, having both the form of godliness <i>and</i> the power thereof. Many things in our lives are important but not true. There are other things, unfortunately, that are often true but not important. I bear you my testimony that the restored Church of Jesus Christ is not just true, but important - a matter of spiritual urgency, a matter of eternal life or death. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Play Through Your Mistakes
Music has always been a very important part of my life. Nearly every major memory of my childhood involves music of some kind: singing with my family on road trips to pass the time; learning barbershop music with my mom and sisters; listening to the Tijuana Brass band on the record player while decorating our Christmas tree; singing my fathers favorite song, "Love at Home" (see Hymns, 2002, no. 294), for family home evening; and admiring my mother as she played the organ in our sacrament meeting every week - something she still does at the young age of eighty. Given that music played such a prominent role in my youth, it will not surprise you to know that I took piano lessons for ten years, from the age of eight to seventeen.
My first piano teacher - we will call her Mrs. Smith - was very strict and had high expectations for mastery. During my lesson she would often follow the music with a pencil as I played. Sometimes, after I hit a sour note or used the wrong fingering, Mrs. Smith would flick my fingers with that pencil. She intended to help me recognize the mistake so that I could correct it. Unfortunately, after several experiences with the dreaded pencil, I learned that the least painful way to handle my musical mistakes was to remove my hands from the keys as quickly as possible.
This habit of abruptly stopping after a mistake was also unintentionally reinforced when I would practice at home. Our piano was positioned on a wall that was opposite our kitchen; in fact, it was back-to-back with our stove. I would often practice while my mother was making dinner on the other side of the wall. When I would make a mistake, she would make a staccato "ah" sound. Startled, my hands would fly from the keys.
I know this was not the intended outcome because I heard her do the same thing when she made her own mistakes at the organ or piano. She still does this today, but only in practice. When she is at the organ or piano for performance, there are few errors, but when they occur, they are hardly noticeable. She can play right on through a mistake like nothing happened. I, on the other hand, cannot.
Most of my piano recitals with Mrs. Smith took place in the chapel of my home ward building. These were reverent occasions - no clapping after the end of each performance, just polite smiles from the audience as we each took our turn at the grand piano. We were not allowed to use our music, so for me, the walk up those three velvety red steps to the piano felt like walking into a battle unarmed. I was terrified that I would make a mistake, take my hands from the keys, and be unable to find the right placement again.
This terror of performing would follow me into adulthood. When I was still in the early years of my public accounting career and had two small children at home, I was called as the Relief Society pianist.
The first week was a disaster. I lur</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder David B. Haight once told this story:
James Peter Fugal was an honest man! He herded sheep much of his life in the rolling hills of Idaho - both his own sheep and sheep for others.
On one bitterly cold winter night, he was herding sheep for another man when a blizzard set in. The sheep bunched together, as sheep do, in the corner of a fenced area, and many died. Many other sheep on surrounding ranches also died that same night because of the weather.
Though the death of the sheep was no fault of his, James Fugal felt responsible and spent the next several years working and saving to repay the owner for his lost sheep.
This was the type of deep moral honor and accountability that was fostered by scripture reading, God-fearing settlers on the early frontier. [David B. Haight, "Ethics and Honesty," Ensign, November 1987, 13]
I have pondered this story many times and wondered what guided Brother Fugal in his commitment to repay the owner for the sheep that died. It appears he had no contract to compel his actions. Something greater than a contract guided Brother Fugals behavior. He could have easily told the rancher he was sorry for the situation and left it at that. For many, that might have been good enough.
How do we measure our behavior? Is 90 percent good enough? Is 99.9 percent good enough? Being 99.9 percent right seems quite good. However, did you know that accuracy of 99.9 percent would mean that we would still have
1 hour of unsafe drinking water every month
2 unsafe plane landings per day at OHare Airport in Chicago
16,000 pieces of mail lost by the U.S. Postal Service every hour
20,000 incorrect prescriptions every year
500 incorrect operations each week
50 babies dropped at birth every day
22,000 checks deducted from the wrong bank account each hour
32,000 missed heartbeats per person each year
[Gloria Diaz, "Quality Counts," Arizona Department of Economic Security, The DEScriber 9 (February 2002): 12]
Is 99.9 percent good enough? Based on these statistics, would you be satisfied? What should we be seeking for? How much allowance for error are we willing to accept?
We know that "the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance" (D&amp;C 1:31). In living our lives we have daily opportunities to make choices that lead us to be more like Christ, or lead us away from Him. In our attitude and choices, how much sin, or error, should we accept? How much do we accept? Can we do better?

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Let me introduce my subject with a brief story. A month or so ago, on a Saturday morning, my wife, Barbara, was busy finishing a baptismal dress for a neighbor girl, and the house was in need of a good picking up and vacuuming. The need was there, so I did what I frequently do in such situations: I pressed the children into service. Unfortunately, I sometimes become grouchy when cleaning house. I noticed, however, that every time I asked my 12-year-old son Matt to do a job, he always responded with a smile and a genuinely cheery face. He was apparently trying to overcome my grouchiness by smiling - which became obvious to me, as it did to everyone else. I apparently kept ignoring the oh-so-obvious smiles, however, because Matt finally said, "Dad, whoever said that smiles were contagious didnt know about your antibodies." I finally melted into a smile.
Well, my antibody against the contagion of a smile is one of my several flaws, which, like a messy house, could use a good picking up and vacuuming. And that is only one of the several flaws I am aware of, thanks to the help of my wife and children. Who knows how many more flaws are lurking, hidden away from my discernment?
Perfect Versus Complete
The thought of such imperfections - obvious sometimes, but sometimes even hidden from ourselves - can be disconcerting in light of Christs celebrated injunction: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Given the tough realities of everyday life, how can we be perfect, even as our Father is perfect? Such things as cleaning house, dealing with people who put us in uncomfortable situations, and reacting to smashed thumbs and road rage sometimes present us with a self-portrait, when looked at honestly, that is further removed from the perfect ideal than we would like to own up to. What we actually do when facing the problems of life compared to what we should do can sometimes lead to discouragement.
In what follows, I would like to explore the meaning of the word perfect, with the hope of showing that the bar that seems so high might be readily cleared by any one of us who really does love the Lord and sincerely wants to honor him. Simply put, I would like to show that perfect does not mean now what it used to mean in King James time. Please understand that I do not aim to diminish Christs injunction but to render it comprehensible in a gospel setting.
First, let me be clear that today perfect means something much more specific than it did 400 years ago. Originally, when borrowed from French, it meant finished, complete, excellent." It came to French from Latin per-, "completely," and -facere, "to do" (see American Heritage Dictionary, s.v. "perfect"). In modern English, however, perfect always raises in our minds a much more specific idea of "fl</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Here is a story that I would like to share with you. The closing speaker at a stake conference was a General Authority. He had talked for about ten minutes when all of a sudden, from way back in the chapel, came a five-year-old boy strolling down the aisle. The boy was all dressed up by his mother for the occasion in gray slacks, a white shirt, and a red bow tie, and his hair was sticking up in the air with a lot of "greasy kid stuff." This dapper young man came down the aisle and stopped right in front of the pulpit. He looked up at the speaker and said, "You talk too loud." Then he turned around and went back to his mother.
Now the speaker hoped there would be no further interruptions. But, lo and behold, after fifteen minutes there came the boy walking down the aisle again, and he stopped for the second time in front of the speaker. This time, he looked up and said, "And you talk too long."
The speaker, however, did not react and continued to finish his talk. After all, we have been trained to keep our cool under all circumstances. Then there was a beautiful congregational closing hymn and the benediction to finish the meeting, followed by the usual socializing and shaking of hands. The mother of the five-year-old boy also came to the stand and said, "Elder, I hope you did not pay too much attention to my five-year-old boy because he was only repeating what other people were saying."
We love the Saints and especially the mothers of five-year-old boys, because, after all, none of us is perfect.
Being Worthy
Today I would like to teach you about one of the aspects of the mission of the Church, namely, "perfecting the Saints." I say teach because I feel I am assigned to be your teacher tonight, and all of you are my students - including the ones that are sitting on the stand. Now, I also know that on this campus - and on other campuses represented here tonight - there are many good students, and if we talk about perfection, I want you to remember these points:
Our perfection started already in the premortal existence. It is a lifelong process while we are on earth and continues beyond the veil.
Also, most of the perfecting is done in your own home, or, if you are a student, in your own room.
Although the words perfect and perfection are used several times in the scriptures, it is easier to describe them than to define them.
If I may use the words of Father Israel in the Old Testament that he spoke to his son Reuben, I would like to describe perfection as "excellency of dignity." Let me explain. The English word dignity is derived from the Latin word dignus, which means "worthy." Excellency, in its original meaning, is "being superior in." So this results then in the definition of perfection as "being superior in worthiness." Now, this may raise immediately with</span>
