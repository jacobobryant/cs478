  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="When my daughter Stephanie was five years old, I took her to register for kindergarten. When we arrived, she was invited to go into a classroom to "play games" with the teachers and other children. As a former elementary school teacher, I was certain the "games" were a method of testing for placement purposes.

A teacher was sitting just outside the room with a box of crayons and several sheets of blank paper, and I smiled confidently to myself from across the hall as Stephanie was asked to choose her favorite color and write her name. "She could write &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;the names in our family," I thought to myself. "She is so well prepared, there isnt anything in that room she cant handle!" But Stephanie just stood there. The teacher repeated the instructions, and again my daughter stood still, staring blankly at the box of crayons with her knees locked and hands behind her back.

In the sweet, patient voice that teachers use when they are beginning to feel slightly &lt;i&gt;im&lt;/i&gt;patient, the teacher asked once more, "Stephanie, choose your favorite color, dear, and write your name on this piece of paper." I was about to come to my daughters aid when the teacher kindly said, "Thats okay. We will help you learn to write your name when you come to school in the fall." With all the restraint I could muster, I watched Stephanie move into the classroom with a teacher who believed my daughter did not know how to write her name.

On the way home I tried to ask as nonchalantly as possible why she had not written her name. "I couldnt," she replied. "The teacher said to choose my favorite color, and there wasnt a pink crayon in the box!"

I reflect on this incident often as I watch my children grow and observe life in general. How many times are we, as Heavenly Fathers children, immobilized because the choice we had in mind for ourselves just isnt available to us, at least not at the time we want it?

Is progress halted when acceptance into a chosen major is denied, when enrollment in a required class is closed, when a desired job doesnt come through, when that dream date doesnt progress beyond friendship, or when the money hoped for isnt there? Are we ever, for reasons that are hard to understand or beyond our control, faced with a set of circumstances that we did not have in mind for ourselves? In other words, what happens when we look in the box and the pink crayon just isnt there? It is so easy to lock our knees, put our hands behind our back, and do nothing when things wished for and dreamed about are beyond our reach. But to do so would defy the very reason we are placed here on this earth. As hard as it sometimes is to understand, stumbling blocks are essential to our progression.

Remember what the Lord said: "If thou art called to pass through [some] tribulation . . . know . . . that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.5-7?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 122:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

I have often wondered how Joseph of old must have felt as his brothers sold him into Egypt. Did he think that the good life was all over for him, that he would never again experience joy? What about Abraham and Isaac? Did they wonder why that horrible, sacrificial commandment had fallen to them? How did Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Hannah feel as they bore the stigma of being barren, when in those days it was interpreted as a sign of Gods displeasure? How did Lehi and Sariah feel as they fled from their home and friends in Jerusalem to live in the wilderness? And in this dispensation, would Hyrum and Joseph ever have chosen the difficulties they faced?

In each of these cases, as we observe the lives of men and women in scripture, it is easy to see how people can triumph over adversity. But in our own everyday lives it is often difficult to see beyond our own frustrations, to remain focused, to see the end from the beginning.

Elder Richard G. Scott wisely instructed in the October 1991 general conference:

&lt;i&gt;Trust &lt;/i&gt;[the Lord], &lt;i&gt;even when in eternal perspective it temporarily hurts very much. Have patience when you are asked to wait when you want immediate action. . . . The path you are to walk through life may be very different from others. You may not always know why He does what He does, but you &lt;/i&gt;can &lt;i&gt;know that He is perfectly just and perfectly merciful. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/11/obtaining-help-from-the-lord?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;"Obtaining Help from the Lord," &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;November 1991, p. 86; emphasis added&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]

When my son Tom was twelve, his dream was to be a professional basketball player. Even though he practiced into the night, he was worried that he wasnt the best on his team and even more worried that he was too short. I remember one night when he asked me, "What will happen to me if I dont reach my goal?" We talked for a long time about choices and individual differences, about challenges and how to know when to persevere and when to change direction.

Tom made the high school team, but when it became apparent that there were other things he could do better, he changed direction. The crayon he would have chosen as a teenager just wasnt there for him. He had to color his life with other choices. At twelve he thought his life would be worthless if he couldnt play pro ball. At twenty-seven he feels successful in what he is doing and is happy in his profession.

Life is like that, and what we might want at twelve or twenty or forty-two or even seventy-two might have to be adapted to the opportunities and options that are available to us at the time.

A few years ago my sister and I were walking along the beach when we began a very serious talk about life, its challenges, and our growing ability to handle whatever came to us. "I think I have lived long enough now that I could handle any challenge given me," I naively stated.

"I think I could, too," was my sisters quick reply.

Then the question that I will remember forever came from her: "Janet, what would be your most difficult challenge?"

I didnt even need to think. I already knew. "The hardest thing for me," I began, "would be the death of my husband. I cant imagine life without Rex."

"That would be hard," she answered, "but I think divorce would be even more difficult for me."

The preposterousness of our fears was interesting. Rex was running marathons and the picture of health. My sisters marriage seemed very much intact, and so, of course, we laughed at suggestions that couldnt possibly become realities.

Just eight months later Rex lay near death in a hospital and my sisters divorce proceedings had begun. Remembering that day and the year that followed will always bring back bittersweet memories for me. My sister and I most certainly would not have chosen those colors from our box of choices, but we had to pull our lives together from the colors that were there. Today she is happy in a new marriage to a wonderful man, and my life with Rex is rich and full. My choice would not have been to experience what was given me to do, yet, as a result, each day is filled with deeper meaning, greater understanding, and new insights. If I could trade it all back now and take the challenges away, I would do so in a minute. I dont like the fact that my husband has cancer. It is definitely a deviation from the life I had in mind for us. But if I &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;turn back the clock, would I also have to trade in what I have learned? I wouldnt want to give that part back. Always having our first choice might mean giving up unknown benefits. As Emerson said, "For everything you have missed, you have gained something else" (&lt;i&gt;Essays: First Series &lt;/i&gt;[1841], "Compensation").

Let me share with you part of a letter someone wrote after hearing the story of Stephanie and her crayons.

&lt;i&gt;I dont have all the colors of crayons that I want - but I do have all the colors that I need. When I need new or different colors in my life, Heavenly Father will make sure that I have them. I know that he will never give me a challenge beyond my reach or beyond the tools he has given me to work with. I also know that the challenges and trials I have are in reality blessings, and I will be better and stronger for having gone through them.&lt;/i&gt;

I bear my testimony that God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers, that he will help us through lifes challenges because he loves us and wants us to return to him. It is my prayer that we will color our lives in a beautiful way with whatever colors are available to us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>When my daughter Stephanie was five years old, I took her to register for kindergarten. When we arrived, she was invited to go into a classroom to "play games" with the teachers and other children. As a former elementary school teacher, I was certain the "games" were a method of testing for placement purposes.</p>
<p>A teacher was sitting just outside the room with a box of crayons and several sheets of blank paper, and I smiled confidently to myself from across the hall as Stephanie was asked to choose her favorite color and write her name. "She could write <i>all </i>the names in our family," I thought to myself. "She is so well prepared, there isnt anything in that room she cant handle!" But Stephanie just stood there. The teacher repeated the instructions, and again my daughter stood still, staring blankly at the box of crayons with her knees locked and hands behind her back.</p>
<p>In the sweet, patient voice that teachers use when they are beginning to feel slightly <i>im</i>patient, the teacher asked once more, "Stephanie, choose your favorite color, dear, and write your name on this piece of paper." I was about to come to my daughters aid when the teacher kindly said, "Thats okay. We will help you learn to write your name when you come to school in the fall." With all the restraint I could muster, I watched Stephanie move into the classroom with a teacher who believed my daughter did not know how to write her name.</p>
<p>On the way home I tried to ask as nonchalantly as possible why she had not written her name. "I couldnt," she replied. "The teacher said to choose my favorite color, and there wasnt a pink crayon in the box!"</p>
<p>I reflect on this incident often as I watch my children grow and observe life in general. How many times are we, as Heavenly Fathers children, immobilized because the choice we had in mind for ourselves just isnt available to us, at least not at the time we want it?</p>
<p>Is progress halted when acceptance into a chosen major is denied, when enrollment in a required class is closed, when a desired job doesnt come through, when that dream date doesnt progress beyond friendship, or when the money hoped for isnt there? Are we ever, for reasons that are hard to understand or beyond our control, faced with a set of circumstances that we did not have in mind for ourselves? In other words, what happens when we look in the box and the pink crayon just isnt there? It is so easy to lock our knees, put our hands behind our back, and do nothing when things wished for and dreamed about are beyond our reach. But to do so would defy the very reason we are placed here on this earth. As hard as it sometimes is to understand, stumbling blocks are essential to our progression.</p>
<p>Remember what the Lord said: "If thou art called to pass through [some] tribulation . . . know . . . that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.5-7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;C 122:57</a></span>).</p>
<p>I have often wondered how Joseph of old must have felt as his brothers sold him into Egypt. Did he think that the good life was all over for him, that he would never again experience joy? What about Abraham and Isaac? Did they wonder why that horrible, sacrificial commandment had fallen to them? How did Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Hannah feel as they bore the stigma of being barren, when in those days it was interpreted as a sign of Gods displeasure? How did Lehi and Sariah feel as they fled from their home and friends in Jerusalem to live in the wilderness? And in this dispensation, would Hyrum and Joseph ever have chosen the difficulties they faced?</p>
<p>In each of these cases, as we observe the lives of men and women in scripture, it is easy to see how people can triumph over adversity. But in our own everyday lives it is often difficult to see beyond our own frustrations, to remain focused, to see the end from the beginning.</p>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott wisely instructed in the October 1991 general conference:</p>
<p><i>Trust </i>[the Lord], <i>even when in eternal perspective it temporarily hurts very much. Have patience when you are asked to wait when you want immediate action. . . . The path you are to walk through life may be very different from others. You may not always know why He does what He does, but you </i>can <i>know that He is perfectly just and perfectly merciful. </i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/11/obtaining-help-from-the-lord?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Obtaining Help from the Lord," <i>Ensign, </i>November 1991, p. 86; emphasis added</a></span>]</p>
<p>When my son Tom was twelve, his dream was to be a professional basketball player. Even though he practiced into the night, he was worried that he wasnt the best on his team and even more worried that he was too short. I remember one night when he asked me, "What will happen to me if I dont reach my goal?" We talked for a long time about choices and individual differences, about challenges and how to know when to persevere and when to change direction.</p>
<p>Tom made the high school team, but when it became apparent that there were other things he could do better, he changed direction. The crayon he would have chosen as a teenager just wasnt there for him. He had to color his life with other choices. At twelve he thought his life would be worthless if he couldnt play pro ball. At twenty-seven he feels successful in what he is doing and is happy in his profession.</p>
<p>Life is like that, and what we might want at twelve or twenty or forty-two or even seventy-two might have to be adapted to the opportunities and options that are available to us at the time.</p>
<p>A few years ago my sister and I were walking along the beach when we began a very serious talk about life, its challenges, and our growing ability to handle whatever came to us. "I think I have lived long enough now that I could handle any challenge given me," I naively stated.</p>
<p>"I think I could, too," was my sisters quick reply.</p>
<p>Then the question that I will remember forever came from her: "Janet, what would be your most difficult challenge?"</p>
<p>I didnt even need to think. I already knew. "The hardest thing for me," I began, "would be the death of my husband. I cant imagine life without Rex."</p>
<p>"That would be hard," she answered, "but I think divorce would be even more difficult for me."</p>
<p>The preposterousness of our fears was interesting. Rex was running marathons and the picture of health. My sisters marriage seemed very much intact, and so, of course, we laughed at suggestions that couldnt possibly become realities.</p>
<p>Just eight months later Rex lay near death in a hospital and my sisters divorce proceedings had begun. Remembering that day and the year that followed will always bring back bittersweet memories for me. My sister and I most certainly would not have chosen those colors from our box of choices, but we had to pull our lives together from the colors that were there. Today she is happy in a new marriage to a wonderful man, and my life with Rex is rich and full. My choice would not have been to experience what was given me to do, yet, as a result, each day is filled with deeper meaning, greater understanding, and new insights. If I could trade it all back now and take the challenges away, I would do so in a minute. I dont like the fact that my husband has cancer. It is definitely a deviation from the life I had in mind for us. But if I <i>could </i>turn back the clock, would I also have to trade in what I have learned? I wouldnt want to give that part back. Always having our first choice might mean giving up unknown benefits. As Emerson said, "For everything you have missed, you have gained something else" (<i>Essays: First Series </i>[1841], "Compensation").</p>
<p>Let me share with you part of a letter someone wrote after hearing the story of Stephanie and her crayons.</p>
<p><i>I dont have all the colors of crayons that I want - but I do have all the colors that I need. When I need new or different colors in my life, Heavenly Father will make sure that I have them. I know that he will never give me a challenge beyond my reach or beyond the tools he has given me to work with. I also know that the challenges and trials I have are in reality blessings, and I will be better and stronger for having gone through them.</i></p>
<p>I bear my testimony that God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers, that he will help us through lifes challenges because he loves us and wants us to return to him. It is my prayer that we will color our lives in a beautiful way with whatever colors are available to us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">At some point after my first couple of years at BYU, a brother in my ward, who was retired from the BYU religion faculty, said, "Hey, you could speak at a devotional!"
I dont know why he thought I might be qualified for that, but I shrugged it off, thinking that if I sang often enough, I would surely be exempt from speaking. Just recently I had the thought that since I have been at BYU for ten years, I might need to lay low to dodge the devotional bullet.
However, six weeks ago I received an email from Vice President Matt Richardson asking if I would be willing to speak at this devotional. I reluctantly replied that I would accept the challenge, though I am not sure that "happily" would describe my attitude.
As I prayed for guidance on a topic, this thought came to me: "I am a reluctant grower." I had never used that term before, though it seemed to suit me well, so I can only guess that the Spirit had coined that phrase just for me.
Needing clarification on that phrase, I went to Google for a precise definition of reluctant. It said that reluctant is an adjective that means "unwilling and hesitant; disinclined." Its synonyms include being "loath to, unwilling to, disinclined to, indisposed to; not in favor of, against, opposed to." Its antonyms include being "willing" and "eager." The word reluctant originated in the mid-seventeenth century from the Latin word reluctant, which means "struggling against," and from the verb reluctari: the prefix re- means "expressing intensive force" and the suffix luctari means "to struggle." As a side note, the word reluctant is worth eleven points in Scrabble.
Am I, as this definition says, unwilling, hesitant, and even disinclined to grow? I will refer to myself, since I am confessing that I am a reluctant grower, but feel free to insert your name where applicable.
Am I Reluctant?
What is it that sometimes makes me hesitant to face a growing opportunity? I am not against hard work. I bore both of my children while pursuing a doctorate, working two jobs, singing operas on the main stage at Indiana University (one of the top music schools in the country), and maintaining a 3.9 GPA. No, I am not opposed to hard work.
Is it that I am not wanting to participate in activities? I am more than willing to fulfill my callings, go visiting teaching, take a dinner - that likely my good husband expertly cooked - to another family, or participate in my wards day of service. No, I am willing to do things that are asked of me.
Am I afraid of the process of growing? Many times while sitting in Relief Society I will hear a sister say, "I prayed for patience" or "I prayed for charity."
I think, "Are you crazy?! Do you not know what challenges come when you pray for Christlike attributes?"
They then proceed to tell of the tr</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Over the past month our ward has welcomed several newborn babies. Each baby comes to this earth curious and eager to learn. They want to taste everything, chew everything, and pull on everything. I imagine that from a babys point of view, everything in this world is new and amazing.
As we anticipated our exodus from the spirit world, we placed great trust in the plan of salvation. We trusted Heavenly Father and our Savior. In Their wisdom, They knew that our spirits would initially flourish best in the physical form of a baby. When our spirits were united with our physical bodies, we became helpless and totally dependent on our caregivers. We forgot our previous knowledge and relationships. It must have been a huge shock to have our spirit and physical body unite. But we were confident in the plan of salvation - we were confident that this earthly life, including the merging of our spirit and physical body, was a necessary step in our eternal progression. Confident in our Saviors Atonement, we came to earth knowing that we could return to our heavenly home. Each of us started our life fresh and innocent, and we began to learn the many things we needed to know in order to function on this earth and continue our eternal progression.
We are children of our Heavenly Father; each individual who comes to this earth is given an extraordinary capacity for learning and growth. We have opportunities in this life to learn information that would have been difficult - if not impossible - to learn in the spirit world. For instance, learning to ride a bicycle would be difficult to accomplish if we only observed others riding their bicycles. Even more difficult would be learning to ride a bicycle if our sole preparation was merely reading books about bicycle riding. Learning by doing is an amazing process. Most of us scraped our knees and elbows as we repeatedly tried to master cycling - without the training wheels. Most of us were successful. We now ride a bicycle without much thought regarding our initial difficulties, fears, and injuries. Fortunately, as young children we were not faced with simultaneous challenges that overwhelmed our capacity to learn and progress. For example, on the same day - or week - that we learned to ride a bicycle, we were not faced with learning to drive a car, pilot an airplane, and fly a rocket to the moon. Typically, as Nephi described in 2 Nephi 28:30, our learning progresses "line upon line, precept upon precept."
At Brigham Young University, before we "go forth to serve," we "enter to learn." We read books, listen to lectures, discuss topics, write papers, and take tests. Many of you will complete a practicum or internship in which you will apply your academic learning to real-life situations. "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;C 93:36).
Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unt</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Im grateful for this invitation to speak at devotional today. Devotionals have always been a part of Brigham Young University campus life. They were first instituted by Karl G. Maeser and early on were offered on a daily basis. By the 1920s, devotionals were held three times a week. Although the number of devotionals per week has changed over the history of the university, their importance to the campus community has remained constant. Karl G. Maesars term as president ended in the 1880s, so we know it has been at least that long that these devotionals have been a traditional part of our campus.
Some years ago I was in a meeting with former academic vice president John Tanner. We were discussing some matters when the devotional became part of the conversation. Vice President Tanner mentioned the importance of the BYU devotional as one of the few experiences on campus we do as a community - what a rich tradition and one that brings us together in body and spirit.
Traditions have the ability to bind us generationally. Most often we associate traditions with holidays and celebrations. But they can simply be the handing down of statements, beliefs, legends, customs, and information that moves from generation to generation. This can happen by word of mouth or by practice. Defining the word tradition varies by academic disciplines. Im simply going to define it here broadly for discussion purposes. For my purpose it will encompass the idea of continued accepted norms, patterns, or customs.
My wife, Gwen, and I recently returned from New Zealand. She spent her teenage years growing up in Wellington. We accompanied other members of her family who were returning back home to New Zealand for the first time in over thirty years. Near the end of our trip, we were making our way from the Bay of Plenty area toward Auckland. En route we planned on attending church in the City of Tauranga. There was no particular reason for selecting this place other than it was halfway between our two destinations. While we were attending the Tauranga Ward, we met a Brother Tata, who invited us to follow him after church to a neighborhood within the city. We followed him to the gates of a Maori marae. A marae is a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Maori culture. It doesnt have to be a building; it can be an open space. To the Maori, the marae is a place just as important to them as their homes.
Brother Tata invited us through the gates and into a courtyard. After a brief moment there, we walked over to the building, took off our shoes, and were invited in. We partook of a ceremony, much of which was spoken in Maori. He then explained to us that, as a young missionary and future apostle, Matthew Cowley began his mission at the location of this marae. He told us that David O. McKay had come to this marae when the New Zealand Temple was dedicated and had brought other General Authorities with hi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">A well-worn and much-loved poem by Robert Frost introduces the subject. You may know the work, or perhaps you have heard only the oft-quoted last lines:
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - 
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
[Robert Frost, "The Road Not Taken" (1916)]
Each day our literal and figurative feet carry us to places where the roads diverge, and we must choose. Some of the choices are no-brainers, in the current vernacular, while some tax our mental capacities. Some seem to be of little consequence while others appear to hold eternity in the balance and really do make "all the difference." Because we are here, in part, to learn to make righteous and right choices, perhaps none is trivial in the longest view. Contrast the thoughtful and deliberate approach to choices and consequences suggested by Frosts poem with the sign that Sister Griffen and I saw in Las Vegas. The sign declared, "Wedding Chapel: No Waiting, No Questions, No Thinking!" We had a good laugh at the sign as we recognized the irony in seeing it on our way to a temple wedding. But the sobering reality is that too many - in and out of the Church - think about some choices too little and fail to connect the road they choose with the place to which it leads.
The Freedom to Choose
Go with me to a vaguely familiar but not quite remembered place and a time too remote to contemplate, where perhaps time as we understand it had no meaning. There was one who would have denied each of us our moral agency - the freedom to choose for good or ill - in order to exalt himself. There was One, also, who saw through that ruse and declared Himself on the side of agency. The scriptures tell of a war full of casualties, except that physical death was not possible for anyone there. No, the cost - spiritual death - was far more serious. Listen to this, from John the Beloved, writing in Revelation:
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his a</span>
