  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My brothers and sisters, it is an honor for me to be with you today. You are choice sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven, sent here at this time to perform a great mission. I know many of you well and others in passing. You are wonderful, and I feel your spirit and know of your goodness and your righteous desires. I humbly pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us and that each of us may know His will as we focus on the goal to build His kingdom.

Recently, as we always do, the coaches of the volleyball team evaluated this past season. We lamented the fact that if we had been three points better in our last match, we would have advanced to the next round of the NCAA championships. After further analysis it was apparent that the results of several of our matches could have been different if we had only been three to six points better. Different training, a more consistent performance, or a better coaching decision could have made the difference. We determined that if each of us on the coaching staff and on the volleyball team is a little better, collectively we will be a lot better.

I invite all of you to join our team in trying to be a little bit better at whatever we do. For the purpose of our discussion today, I challenge all of us to do as the Lord instructs in the Doctrine and Covenants:

&lt;i&gt;Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 58:2728]

President Gordon B. Hinckley, by his example and by his instruction, teaches us about that great cause in which we should be anxiously engaged:

&lt;i&gt;How glorious is the past of this great cause. It is filled with heroism, courage, boldness, and faith. How wondrous is the present as we move forward to bless the lives of people wherever they will hearken to the message of the servants of the Lord. How magnificent will be the future as the Almighty rolls on His glorious work, touching for good all who will accept and live His gospel, and even reaching to the eternal blessing of His sons and daughters of all generations through the selfless work of those whose hearts are filled with love for the Redeemer of the world.&lt;/i&gt; [Gordon B. Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;Stand a Little Taller: Counsel and Inspiration for Each Day of the Year&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Eagle Gate, 2001), 38]

Because we love the Redeemer, we are called to the work. We should be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. We have the power: let us be about doing good. The Spirit will guide us in knowing what and how to do it, for we are agents unto ourselves.

As we strive to be better, I would like to suggest 10 things we might do to be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Prayerfully Act&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
President Ezra Taft Benson taught:

&lt;i&gt;Less spiritually advanced people, such as those in the days of Moses, had to be commanded in many things. Today those spiritually alert look at the objectives, check the guidelines laid down by the Lord and his prophets, and then prayerfully act - without having to be commanded "in all things." This attitude prepares men for godhood.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; April 1965, 121]

If you prayerfully and anxiously engage in opportunities to act, and pursue them with diligence, you will find yourself progressing toward your goals and contributing to the Lords cause. The Lord will direct your life and lead you to magnify your callings.

I, like many of you, was directed to BYU even though my friends attended other institutions. I came planning to pursue a career in elementary education. As I became involved in one of my favorite activities, sports, I found opportunities for leadership. Soon I found I had talent and a desire to pursue physical education. By devoting my energies to developing these talents, I was selected to teach and help direct university student programs.

As I approached graduation I received a contract for my dream job, teaching at a prestigious high school in Salt Lake City. Just before school ended, the dean of the college called me to his office, asked me to give up my contract to teach at the high school, and requested that I teach at Brigham Young University the next year. I had never envisioned the possibility of teaching at BYU. I did not have the exceptional intelligence I saw in my university professors. But the Lord knew my willingness to be an instrument in His hands to find a special way to serve the youth of the Church and serve in this part of the kingdom.

If we are anxiously engaged in whatever we are inspired and called to do, we will be prepared for what the Lord has in store for us as we go through life. For some it may not be the conventional path. If we are diligent it will be the direction the Lord would have us follow. He knows what is in store for us and will lead us to the fulfillment of our purpose in life.

So I would urge you and me to be a little bit better in our service. Be better prepared for your teaching assignment in the ward. Do your assignments well and on time. Study the gospel with the same intensity as you do your academic work. Prayerfully act to meet the needs of those you serve in your callings as a home teacher or visiting teacher.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Contribute Good to the World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In the book of Moroni, Mormon taught: "For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also" (Moroni 7:5).

President Hinckley added:

&lt;i&gt;You are good. But it is not enough just to be good. You must be good for something. You must contribute good to the world. The world must be a better place for your presence. And the good that is in you must be spread to others.&lt;/i&gt; [Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;Stand a Little,&lt;/i&gt; 26]

Do something good in the world each day. Help someone in need. Be good at your work so that others may benefit. Share the blessings of the gospel. Be a good brother or sister to others.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Be an Example of the Virtues of the Gospel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the ways we can make the world better is by the way we live our lives. If we are examples of honesty, character, and integrity, our influence will help others to recognize these values as qualities they respect and want in their own lives.

In the recent Australian Open - one of the grand-slam professional tennis tour championships - Jiri Novak from the Czech Republic was playing a critical game in a quarterfinal match. On game point his opponent hit a ball that the linesman called long. His opponent asked the umpire to overrule the linesman. The ball had landed on the side of the court, which allowed the umpire to get a good look at the ball, but the umpire refused to overrule the linesman. Knowing the call would give his opponent the game, Novak told the umpire the ball was in, and his opponent was awarded the point. The capacity crowd vigorously applauded his honor call.

There are several significant points in this incident. Novak was a professional athlete, and there was a lot of money weighing on the outcome of this match, which he lost. It is not common for this type of honor call to happen in major tennis competitions. The crowds response is indicative of respect for the honesty exhibited in this situation. People believe in the virtue of honesty. However, it takes courage and character to live these virtues in our world.

In the second collegiate national championships for volleyball in 1970, the BYU team was playing in a pool-play match to determine qualification for the quarterfinals. Brenda, the middle blocker, hit the ball, which landed in the opponents court, giving the team the final point of the match. The team celebrated, except for Brenda. She told the referee that she had touched the net. The referee was stunned and unsure what to do. Brenda noted the officials hesitation and explained she realized it was difficult to see, but she had touched the net, which made it an illegal play. The official reversed the call, and play continued. After the match several missionaries brought some investigators to see the team. The honor call became an interesting point of discussion.

As the tournament progressed, there were other occasions where honor calls were used by BYUs team. Some teams would also make honor calls when they competed against BYU, but not during their matches with other opponents. The National Association for Girls and Women in Sport was the governing body of the championship at that time. The members of the NAGWS board of directors, who witnessed the events at the championships, were so impressed with the honor calls at the competitions that a statement was drafted for the rule book that requested coaches and officials to encourage honor calls in competitions governed by NAGWS rules. That statement still appears in the current rule book.

Last spring the softball team was playing a game against Louisiana Tech. The score was 0 to 0 in the fifth inning. The Louisiana Tech lead-off hitter sent a ball deep to center field. The umpire ruled that it was a ground rule double because the ball had bounced over the fence. The BYU center fielder, while chasing the ball, stumbled over the fence. Coach Amicone went to see if she was okay, and she told her she was but that the ball went over the fence, making it a home run. This was also confirmed by both the left and right fielders.

Coach Amicone went to the second-base umpire and told him the ball had gone over the fence without bouncing, so it was a home run. The second-base umpire met with the home-plate umpire, and they decided since it was a judgment call, he had to leave the Louisiana Tech player at second base.

Later in the game the umpire told BYUs catcher that he had never seen anyone come to an umpire to tell him the ball went over the fence as a home run when the call was favorable to their team. He was amazed by the honesty of the players. In all his experience he had never seen anything like that before.

As we strive to be examples to the world, I ask all of you to evaluate your behavior at our athletic contests. Do you treat our guests, fans, opponents, referees, and media with respect? Will they be favorably impressed with our university as they leave the arena? Will our behavior be an example of what we believe? The teams do not need you to taunt, distract, or be demeaning to our opponents or officials. We want to compete fairly and win based on the quality of our play. We want to win against an opponent on his or her best day. Help us to play our best by offering your support and encouragement.

A mission of the university athletic teams is to be missionaries and to build the kingdom by the example we set and the quality of our play. At a meeting with Elder Henry B. Eyring, the coaches were counseled to lead our teams to be "very, very good and very, very nice." Many times we are in a position to open doors for missionaries because we have had an opportunity to be an example on the court, on television, or as we travel of who we are and what we represent. We hope that example will cause someone to take an interest in the Church we represent. I invite you to be a part of that example, influencing those who share the arena with us to have a favorable impression of BYU.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Be Valiant in the Cause of Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Everyone has opportunities to demonstrate by example the virtues of the gospel. In his book &lt;i&gt;Standing for Something,&lt;/i&gt; President Hinckley pleaded with us to stand for what we believe:

&lt;i&gt;We cannot be indifferent to the great cause of truth and right. We cannot afford to stand on the sidelines and watch the play between the forces of good and evil. Wrote John the Revelator: "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth" (Revelation 3:1516).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Johns imagery is vivid. It points to our critical duty to stand strong, even to become leaders in speaking up on behalf of those causes that make our civilization shine. Each of us can be a leader within our sphere of influence. The adversary of all truth would put into our hearts a reluctance to make an effort; we must cast that fear aside and be valiant in the cause of truth, fairness, and right.&lt;/i&gt; [Gordon B. Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;Standing for Something&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Times Books, 2000), 17172]

Life at BYU is a good one. We have made commitments to live a higher standard based on gospel principles. It is important to understand the meaning of those commitments we have made and make them a permanent part of our lifestyle. These standards can be an armor to help ward off the ways of the world. With this commitment to live the gospel comes the courage to stand strong and be valiant in the cause of truth.

While we are learning at the feet of the apostles of the Lord and His servants, we should listen and learn from their counsel and teachings. We should check our armor for chinks that could be stumbling blocks placed in our path by the adversary. How are you doing with the Honor Code? Are you committed to its value to you as a code of conduct that makes you a worthy servant of the Lord? Do you support the Dress and Grooming Standards? Do you understand the purpose of these standards? Standards and guidelines help us keep focused on why we are here and prepare us to stand strong and be valiant leaders.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Seek the Companionship of the Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
When I was in my teenage years, my father was a stake president. At that time the General Authorities stayed overnight in the home of the stake president on Saturday night between stake conference sessions. We had a small, humble home with only two bedrooms appropriate for the visiting Brethren: my parents room and my simple room. My room became the guest room. I remember cleaning thoroughly and preparing my room so everything was neat, orderly, and appropriate for our guests. I felt everything and every activity conducted therein needed to contribute to an atmosphere where the Spirit could be present for our guests. Many apostles and other leaders spent a night in my room.

That experience led me to a lifelong quest to be sure my life is in order to invite the Spirit to be my companion. How we dress, our conduct, our environment, our associates, and the activities in which we engage all influence the opportunity for the Spirit to be a part of our lives. If we keep our lives in order, the companionship of the Spirit will provide us with peace, comfort, guidance, and promptings. It will enlighten us regarding the Lords will and help us testify of Christ.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Beware of the Adversary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It is not always easy to live each day as we would like. But it is easier when we take care of the chinks in our armor.

An example of one of the more subtle chinks the adversary uses to divert our attention from the influence of the Spirit is pride. President Ezra Taft Benson in his wonderful talk on pride declared that "pride is a sin" and cited several faces of pride: "selfishness . . . , self-conceit, self-pity, worldly self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking." President Benson continued, "The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. . . . Pride is ugly. It says, If you succeed, I am a failure" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware of Pride," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1989, 5, 6).

There are many circumstances in the university setting that can foster pride. Whenever there is a status system, it is a challenge to value people and work equally. Being a member of a team where there are starters, finishers, and substitutes is another setting where pride can enter into the team chemistry. People who are not teachable or become defensive limit their progress because of pride. Worldly recognition and awards may not be equal and fair and can subtly foster pride unless perspective and recognition of the contributions of others are acknowledged.

Where pride is prevalent, unity is impossible. Unity is mandatory for a team to succeed. It is also mandatory for a family, a marriage, or a business to succeed. I believe that a primary factor in the success of our teams at BYU is team chemistry, where the focus is on the team as we compete. The true meaning of competition embodies the process of striving together.

President Benson continued in his address: "The antidote for pride is humility - meekness, submissiveness. (See Alma 7:23.) It is the broken heart and contrite spirit" (Benson, "Beware," 6). Humble behavior is selflessness and respect and esteem for others as ourselves. It is doing service, being teachable, submitting to the Lords will, and putting Him first in our lives. In closing his masterful address on pride, President Benson declared, "We must yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, put off the prideful natural man, become a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and become as a child, submissive, meek, humble" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware," 7).

Listen to the prophets. They will warn us of the ways the adversary will challenge our commitment to the Lord. Yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, who is our personal guide to help us become a saint.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Be a Participant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We saw many great examples of gracious, humble athletes during the Olympics. Their sincere appreciation for the opportunity to participate was expressed often. Although goals may not have been reached, satisfaction in doing ones best was their reward. What a wonderful experience it was for all of us to share with the world the joy of participation and effort. We would all do well to adopt the Olympic Creed:

&lt;i&gt;The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part. The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.&lt;/i&gt; [Baron Pierre de Coubertin, in &lt;i&gt;Games of the XXIIIrd Olympiad Los Angeles 1984 Commemorative Book &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: International Sport Publications, Inc., 1984), 270]

I like the definition and insights of a champion offered by 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek:

&lt;i&gt;On Being a Champion&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A champion is a winner,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A hero . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Someone who never gives up&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Even when the going gets rough.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A champion is a member of&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A winning team . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Someone who overcomes challenges&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Even when it requires creative solutions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A champion is an optimist,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A hopeful spirit . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Someone who plays the game,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Even when the game is called life . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Especially when the game is called life.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There can be a champion in each of us,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If we live as a winner,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If we live as a member of the team,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If we live with a hopeful spirit,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For life.&lt;/i&gt;
[Mattie J. T. Stepanek, &lt;i&gt;Journey Through Heartsongs&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Hyperion, 2001), 20]

Be a participant, enjoy life, dont worry and fret. Have a hopeful spirit. Be anxiously engaged in the game of life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Stay Focused&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It is easier to keep the commandments and our covenants when we keep the game plan in focus. Understanding the plan of salvation and keeping our focus on preparation for exaltation will help us to keep our priorities straight. If we will remember to keep our focus every day and make every decision based on our goal to return to our Heavenly Father with the help of our Brother, Jesus Christ, we will have eternal life.

Lifes experience is a lot like a game. It is hard to keep focused for the duration of the game - or the match. The opponent provides challenges and tests as the game progresses. When there is a letdown, we fall behind. But we can refocus and get back on track. With the new rally scoring in volleyball, we divided the game into seven-point minigames to provide a checkpoint on how we were doing to meet our end goal. Coach Judkins divided the basketball game into eight, five-minute segments to help the basketball team focus. During breaks, coaches build confidence, provide counsel, give encouragement, and adjust strategy. Coaches never give up - they always believe they can still achieve a goal. They coach to the last play.

Life is like the game. We lose focus sometimes. Our prayers have less meaning. Daily pressures make it hard to study the scriptures. We forget to listen to the Spirit. The opposition diverts our attention to world affairs. When there is a letdown, we fall behind. But we can refocus and get back on track. The Lord has given us hours, days, and years as checkpoints to help us focus on the final goal of eternal life. We have coaches of life to help us toward that goal: parents, teachers, friends, bishops, angels, prophets, apostles, home teachers, visiting teachers, leaders, and the Holy Spirit. Use valuable checkpoints to help you: prayer, scriptures, church attendance, devotionals, and service. We must keep our focus. Never give up. Your coaches will be there to the last play.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Be Happy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The key to happiness is to be anxiously engaged in doing whatever we are guided to do by the Holy Spirit to be a part of this great cause. This will bring true happiness. President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed it this way:

&lt;i&gt;Do you want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause. Lend your efforts to helping people. Cultivate a spirit of forgiveness in your heart against any who might have offended you. Look to the Lord and live and work to lift and serve His sons and daughters. You will come to know a happiness that you have never known before if you will do that.&lt;/i&gt; [Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;Stand a Little,&lt;/i&gt; 192]

The happiness you will experience is the joy of effort. A great example is the missionaries who serve years in the mission field and return with unfulfilled dreams of numerous converts, yet they speak of the greatness of their mission because of the joy of being totally engaged in a good cause. It is like the Olympian who trains hours, days, and years to participate, knowing that only one will receive the gold. To participate and enjoy the process of striving to reach your potential is worth the effort.

It is the same for us as we strive and train daily for eternal life. It is a wonderful experience as we progress through life to reach our full potential as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. But in the Lords plan, He desires all of us to obtain the gold, which is eternal life.

As with the Olympic athlete, there will be challenges and setbacks in our progression. There may even be a major problem like a knee injury, which means there has to be rehabilitation before we can continue to progress. It takes courage and determination to endure and pursue the goal. We know the adversary will put stumbling blocks in the way. But we have our support system to help us. Remember that the Savior has experienced all the emotions, pains, and suffering we will have to endure. He will be there to show us the way. Being anxiously engaged in this great cause will bring you great joy.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Bear Testimony&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In closing, I would like to share with you one of my favorite scriptures:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 68:6]

The phrase "be of good cheer" is one of my favorite messages from the Savior. It implies a life of joy, happiness, and optimism based on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our knowledge of the plan of salvation. We know that He lives and loves us and is our advocate with our Father in Heaven. This faith in the Lord and our gratitude for His atoning sacrifice compels us to assist in this great work by bearing our testimony that He is the Son of the living God, that this is His work, and that He will come again.

We cannot be slackers in our commitment to the Lord, in our effort to be an example of His teaching, or in our desire to share what we have with those with whom we have contact. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our gratitude for His sacrifice for us compels us to serve by bearing testimony of Him, even Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. May we do this by our example and our performance, knowing we need not fear but can have courage because the Lord is with us and will stand by us. May the Lord bless each of us as we strive to serve.

Let us strive to be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. I invite you to join me in trying to be a little bit better in His service.

I leave with you my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, our Heavenly Father. This is His work, and we are called to the work because we love Him, our Redeemer. Be of good cheer is my prayer for all of us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>My brothers and sisters, it is an honor for me to be with you today. You are choice sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven, sent here at this time to perform a great mission. I know many of you well and others in passing. You are wonderful, and I feel your spirit and know of your goodness and your righteous desires. I humbly pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us and that each of us may know His will as we focus on the goal to build His kingdom.</p>
<p>Recently, as we always do, the coaches of the volleyball team evaluated this past season. We lamented the fact that if we had been three points better in our last match, we would have advanced to the next round of the NCAA championships. After further analysis it was apparent that the results of several of our matches could have been different if we had only been three to six points better. Different training, a more consistent performance, or a better coaching decision could have made the difference. We determined that if each of us on the coaching staff and on the volleyball team is a little better, collectively we will be a lot better.</p>
<p>I invite all of you to join our team in trying to be a little bit better at whatever we do. For the purpose of our discussion today, I challenge all of us to do as the Lord instructs in the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i></p>
<p><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i> [D&amp;C 58:2728]</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley, by his example and by his instruction, teaches us about that great cause in which we should be anxiously engaged:</p>
<p><i>How glorious is the past of this great cause. It is filled with heroism, courage, boldness, and faith. How wondrous is the present as we move forward to bless the lives of people wherever they will hearken to the message of the servants of the Lord. How magnificent will be the future as the Almighty rolls on His glorious work, touching for good all who will accept and live His gospel, and even reaching to the eternal blessing of His sons and daughters of all generations through the selfless work of those whose hearts are filled with love for the Redeemer of the world.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Stand a Little Taller: Counsel and Inspiration for Each Day of the Year</i> (Salt Lake City: Eagle Gate, 2001), 38]</p>
<p>Because we love the Redeemer, we are called to the work. We should be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. We have the power: let us be about doing good. The Spirit will guide us in knowing what and how to do it, for we are agents unto ourselves.</p>
<p>As we strive to be better, I would like to suggest 10 things we might do to be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness.</p>
<h2><b>1. Prayerfully Act</b></h2>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson taught:</p>
<p><i>Less spiritually advanced people, such as those in the days of Moses, had to be commanded in many things. Today those spiritually alert look at the objectives, check the guidelines laid down by the Lord and his prophets, and then prayerfully act - without having to be commanded "in all things." This attitude prepares men for godhood.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1965, 121]</p>
<p>If you prayerfully and anxiously engage in opportunities to act, and pursue them with diligence, you will find yourself progressing toward your goals and contributing to the Lords cause. The Lord will direct your life and lead you to magnify your callings.</p>
<p>I, like many of you, was directed to BYU even though my friends attended other institutions. I came planning to pursue a career in elementary education. As I became involved in one of my favorite activities, sports, I found opportunities for leadership. Soon I found I had talent and a desire to pursue physical education. By devoting my energies to developing these talents, I was selected to teach and help direct university student programs.</p>
<p>As I approached graduation I received a contract for my dream job, teaching at a prestigious high school in Salt Lake City. Just before school ended, the dean of the college called me to his office, asked me to give up my contract to teach at the high school, and requested that I teach at Brigham Young University the next year. I had never envisioned the possibility of teaching at BYU. I did not have the exceptional intelligence I saw in my university professors. But the Lord knew my willingness to be an instrument in His hands to find a special way to serve the youth of the Church and serve in this part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>If we are anxiously engaged in whatever we are inspired and called to do, we will be prepared for what the Lord has in store for us as we go through life. For some it may not be the conventional path. If we are diligent it will be the direction the Lord would have us follow. He knows what is in store for us and will lead us to the fulfillment of our purpose in life.</p>
<p>So I would urge you and me to be a little bit better in our service. Be better prepared for your teaching assignment in the ward. Do your assignments well and on time. Study the gospel with the same intensity as you do your academic work. Prayerfully act to meet the needs of those you serve in your callings as a home teacher or visiting teacher.</p>
<h2><b>2. Contribute Good to the World</b></h2>
<p>In the book of Moroni, Mormon taught: "For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also" (Moroni 7:5).</p>
<p>President Hinckley added:</p>
<p><i>You are good. But it is not enough just to be good. You must be good for something. You must contribute good to the world. The world must be a better place for your presence. And the good that is in you must be spread to others.</i> [Hinckley, <i>Stand a Little,</i> 26]</p>
<p>Do something good in the world each day. Help someone in need. Be good at your work so that others may benefit. Share the blessings of the gospel. Be a good brother or sister to others.</p>
<h2><b>3. Be an Example of the Virtues of the Gospel</b></h2>
<p>One of the ways we can make the world better is by the way we live our lives. If we are examples of honesty, character, and integrity, our influence will help others to recognize these values as qualities they respect and want in their own lives.</p>
<p>In the recent Australian Open - one of the grand-slam professional tennis tour championships - Jiri Novak from the Czech Republic was playing a critical game in a quarterfinal match. On game point his opponent hit a ball that the linesman called long. His opponent asked the umpire to overrule the linesman. The ball had landed on the side of the court, which allowed the umpire to get a good look at the ball, but the umpire refused to overrule the linesman. Knowing the call would give his opponent the game, Novak told the umpire the ball was in, and his opponent was awarded the point. The capacity crowd vigorously applauded his honor call.</p>
<p>There are several significant points in this incident. Novak was a professional athlete, and there was a lot of money weighing on the outcome of this match, which he lost. It is not common for this type of honor call to happen in major tennis competitions. The crowds response is indicative of respect for the honesty exhibited in this situation. People believe in the virtue of honesty. However, it takes courage and character to live these virtues in our world.</p>
<p>In the second collegiate national championships for volleyball in 1970, the BYU team was playing in a pool-play match to determine qualification for the quarterfinals. Brenda, the middle blocker, hit the ball, which landed in the opponents court, giving the team the final point of the match. The team celebrated, except for Brenda. She told the referee that she had touched the net. The referee was stunned and unsure what to do. Brenda noted the officials hesitation and explained she realized it was difficult to see, but she had touched the net, which made it an illegal play. The official reversed the call, and play continued. After the match several missionaries brought some investigators to see the team. The honor call became an interesting point of discussion.</p>
<p>As the tournament progressed, there were other occasions where honor calls were used by BYUs team. Some teams would also make honor calls when they competed against BYU, but not during their matches with other opponents. The National Association for Girls and Women in Sport was the governing body of the championship at that time. The members of the NAGWS board of directors, who witnessed the events at the championships, were so impressed with the honor calls at the competitions that a statement was drafted for the rule book that requested coaches and officials to encourage honor calls in competitions governed by NAGWS rules. That statement still appears in the current rule book.</p>
<p>Last spring the softball team was playing a game against Louisiana Tech. The score was 0 to 0 in the fifth inning. The Louisiana Tech lead-off hitter sent a ball deep to center field. The umpire ruled that it was a ground rule double because the ball had bounced over the fence. The BYU center fielder, while chasing the ball, stumbled over the fence. Coach Amicone went to see if she was okay, and she told her she was but that the ball went over the fence, making it a home run. This was also confirmed by both the left and right fielders.</p>
<p>Coach Amicone went to the second-base umpire and told him the ball had gone over the fence without bouncing, so it was a home run. The second-base umpire met with the home-plate umpire, and they decided since it was a judgment call, he had to leave the Louisiana Tech player at second base.</p>
<p>Later in the game the umpire told BYUs catcher that he had never seen anyone come to an umpire to tell him the ball went over the fence as a home run when the call was favorable to their team. He was amazed by the honesty of the players. In all his experience he had never seen anything like that before.</p>
<p>As we strive to be examples to the world, I ask all of you to evaluate your behavior at our athletic contests. Do you treat our guests, fans, opponents, referees, and media with respect? Will they be favorably impressed with our university as they leave the arena? Will our behavior be an example of what we believe? The teams do not need you to taunt, distract, or be demeaning to our opponents or officials. We want to compete fairly and win based on the quality of our play. We want to win against an opponent on his or her best day. Help us to play our best by offering your support and encouragement.</p>
<p>A mission of the university athletic teams is to be missionaries and to build the kingdom by the example we set and the quality of our play. At a meeting with Elder Henry B. Eyring, the coaches were counseled to lead our teams to be "very, very good and very, very nice." Many times we are in a position to open doors for missionaries because we have had an opportunity to be an example on the court, on television, or as we travel of who we are and what we represent. We hope that example will cause someone to take an interest in the Church we represent. I invite you to be a part of that example, influencing those who share the arena with us to have a favorable impression of BYU.</p>
<h2><b>4. Be Valiant in the Cause of Truth</b></h2>
<p>Everyone has opportunities to demonstrate by example the virtues of the gospel. In his book <i>Standing for Something,</i> President Hinckley pleaded with us to stand for what we believe:</p>
<p><i>We cannot be indifferent to the great cause of truth and right. We cannot afford to stand on the sidelines and watch the play between the forces of good and evil. Wrote John the Revelator: "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth" (Revelation 3:1516).</i></p>
<p><i>Johns imagery is vivid. It points to our critical duty to stand strong, even to become leaders in speaking up on behalf of those causes that make our civilization shine. Each of us can be a leader within our sphere of influence. The adversary of all truth would put into our hearts a reluctance to make an effort; we must cast that fear aside and be valiant in the cause of truth, fairness, and right.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Standing for Something</i> (New York: Times Books, 2000), 17172]</p>
<p>Life at BYU is a good one. We have made commitments to live a higher standard based on gospel principles. It is important to understand the meaning of those commitments we have made and make them a permanent part of our lifestyle. These standards can be an armor to help ward off the ways of the world. With this commitment to live the gospel comes the courage to stand strong and be valiant in the cause of truth.</p>
<p>While we are learning at the feet of the apostles of the Lord and His servants, we should listen and learn from their counsel and teachings. We should check our armor for chinks that could be stumbling blocks placed in our path by the adversary. How are you doing with the Honor Code? Are you committed to its value to you as a code of conduct that makes you a worthy servant of the Lord? Do you support the Dress and Grooming Standards? Do you understand the purpose of these standards? Standards and guidelines help us keep focused on why we are here and prepare us to stand strong and be valiant leaders.</p>
<h2><b>5. Seek the Companionship of the Spirit</b></h2>
<p>When I was in my teenage years, my father was a stake president. At that time the General Authorities stayed overnight in the home of the stake president on Saturday night between stake conference sessions. We had a small, humble home with only two bedrooms appropriate for the visiting Brethren: my parents room and my simple room. My room became the guest room. I remember cleaning thoroughly and preparing my room so everything was neat, orderly, and appropriate for our guests. I felt everything and every activity conducted therein needed to contribute to an atmosphere where the Spirit could be present for our guests. Many apostles and other leaders spent a night in my room.</p>
<p>That experience led me to a lifelong quest to be sure my life is in order to invite the Spirit to be my companion. How we dress, our conduct, our environment, our associates, and the activities in which we engage all influence the opportunity for the Spirit to be a part of our lives. If we keep our lives in order, the companionship of the Spirit will provide us with peace, comfort, guidance, and promptings. It will enlighten us regarding the Lords will and help us testify of Christ.</p>
<h2><b>6. Beware of the Adversary</b></h2>
<p>It is not always easy to live each day as we would like. But it is easier when we take care of the chinks in our armor.</p>
<p>An example of one of the more subtle chinks the adversary uses to divert our attention from the influence of the Spirit is pride. President Ezra Taft Benson in his wonderful talk on pride declared that "pride is a sin" and cited several faces of pride: "selfishness . . . , self-conceit, self-pity, worldly self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking." President Benson continued, "The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. . . . Pride is ugly. It says, If you succeed, I am a failure" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware of Pride," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1989, 5, 6).</p>
<p>There are many circumstances in the university setting that can foster pride. Whenever there is a status system, it is a challenge to value people and work equally. Being a member of a team where there are starters, finishers, and substitutes is another setting where pride can enter into the team chemistry. People who are not teachable or become defensive limit their progress because of pride. Worldly recognition and awards may not be equal and fair and can subtly foster pride unless perspective and recognition of the contributions of others are acknowledged.</p>
<p>Where pride is prevalent, unity is impossible. Unity is mandatory for a team to succeed. It is also mandatory for a family, a marriage, or a business to succeed. I believe that a primary factor in the success of our teams at BYU is team chemistry, where the focus is on the team as we compete. The true meaning of competition embodies the process of striving together.</p>
<p>President Benson continued in his address: "The antidote for pride is humility - meekness, submissiveness. (See Alma 7:23.) It is the broken heart and contrite spirit" (Benson, "Beware," 6). Humble behavior is selflessness and respect and esteem for others as ourselves. It is doing service, being teachable, submitting to the Lords will, and putting Him first in our lives. In closing his masterful address on pride, President Benson declared, "We must yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, put off the prideful natural man, become a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and become as a child, submissive, meek, humble" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware," 7).</p>
<p>Listen to the prophets. They will warn us of the ways the adversary will challenge our commitment to the Lord. Yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, who is our personal guide to help us become a saint.</p>
<h2><b>7. Be a Participant</b></h2>
<p>We saw many great examples of gracious, humble athletes during the Olympics. Their sincere appreciation for the opportunity to participate was expressed often. Although goals may not have been reached, satisfaction in doing ones best was their reward. What a wonderful experience it was for all of us to share with the world the joy of participation and effort. We would all do well to adopt the Olympic Creed:</p>
<p><i>The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part. The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.</i> [Baron Pierre de Coubertin, in <i>Games of the XXIIIrd Olympiad Los Angeles 1984 Commemorative Book </i>(Salt Lake City: International Sport Publications, Inc., 1984), 270]</p>
<p>I like the definition and insights of a champion offered by 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek:</p>
<p><i>On Being a Champion</i><br />
<i>A champion is a winner,</i><br />
<i>A hero . . .</i><br />
<i>Someone who never gives up</i><br />
<i>Even when the going gets rough.</i></p>
<p><i>A champion is a member of</i><br />
<i>A winning team . . .</i><br />
<i>Someone who overcomes challenges</i><br />
<i>Even when it requires creative solutions.</i></p>
<p><i>A champion is an optimist,</i><br />
<i>A hopeful spirit . . .</i><br />
<i>Someone who plays the game,</i><br />
<i>Even when the game is called life . . .</i><br />
<i>Especially when the game is called life.</i></p>
<p><i>There can be a champion in each of us,</i><br />
<i>If we live as a winner,</i><br />
<i>If we live as a member of the team,</i><br />
<i>If we live with a hopeful spirit,</i><br />
<i>For life.</i><br />
[Mattie J. T. Stepanek, <i>Journey Through Heartsongs</i> (New York: Hyperion, 2001), 20]</p>
<p>Be a participant, enjoy life, dont worry and fret. Have a hopeful spirit. Be anxiously engaged in the game of life.</p>
<h2><b>8. Stay Focused</b></h2>
<p>It is easier to keep the commandments and our covenants when we keep the game plan in focus. Understanding the plan of salvation and keeping our focus on preparation for exaltation will help us to keep our priorities straight. If we will remember to keep our focus every day and make every decision based on our goal to return to our Heavenly Father with the help of our Brother, Jesus Christ, we will have eternal life.</p>
<p>Lifes experience is a lot like a game. It is hard to keep focused for the duration of the game - or the match. The opponent provides challenges and tests as the game progresses. When there is a letdown, we fall behind. But we can refocus and get back on track. With the new rally scoring in volleyball, we divided the game into seven-point minigames to provide a checkpoint on how we were doing to meet our end goal. Coach Judkins divided the basketball game into eight, five-minute segments to help the basketball team focus. During breaks, coaches build confidence, provide counsel, give encouragement, and adjust strategy. Coaches never give up - they always believe they can still achieve a goal. They coach to the last play.</p>
<p>Life is like the game. We lose focus sometimes. Our prayers have less meaning. Daily pressures make it hard to study the scriptures. We forget to listen to the Spirit. The opposition diverts our attention to world affairs. When there is a letdown, we fall behind. But we can refocus and get back on track. The Lord has given us hours, days, and years as checkpoints to help us focus on the final goal of eternal life. We have coaches of life to help us toward that goal: parents, teachers, friends, bishops, angels, prophets, apostles, home teachers, visiting teachers, leaders, and the Holy Spirit. Use valuable checkpoints to help you: prayer, scriptures, church attendance, devotionals, and service. We must keep our focus. Never give up. Your coaches will be there to the last play.</p>
<h2><b>9. Be Happy</b></h2>
<p>The key to happiness is to be anxiously engaged in doing whatever we are guided to do by the Holy Spirit to be a part of this great cause. This will bring true happiness. President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed it this way:</p>
<p><i>Do you want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause. Lend your efforts to helping people. Cultivate a spirit of forgiveness in your heart against any who might have offended you. Look to the Lord and live and work to lift and serve His sons and daughters. You will come to know a happiness that you have never known before if you will do that.</i> [Hinckley, <i>Stand a Little,</i> 192]</p>
<p>The happiness you will experience is the joy of effort. A great example is the missionaries who serve years in the mission field and return with unfulfilled dreams of numerous converts, yet they speak of the greatness of their mission because of the joy of being totally engaged in a good cause. It is like the Olympian who trains hours, days, and years to participate, knowing that only one will receive the gold. To participate and enjoy the process of striving to reach your potential is worth the effort.</p>
<p>It is the same for us as we strive and train daily for eternal life. It is a wonderful experience as we progress through life to reach our full potential as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. But in the Lords plan, He desires all of us to obtain the gold, which is eternal life.</p>
<p>As with the Olympic athlete, there will be challenges and setbacks in our progression. There may even be a major problem like a knee injury, which means there has to be rehabilitation before we can continue to progress. It takes courage and determination to endure and pursue the goal. We know the adversary will put stumbling blocks in the way. But we have our support system to help us. Remember that the Savior has experienced all the emotions, pains, and suffering we will have to endure. He will be there to show us the way. Being anxiously engaged in this great cause will bring you great joy.</p>
<h2><b>10. Bear Testimony</b></h2>
<p>In closing, I would like to share with you one of my favorite scriptures:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</i> [D&amp;C 68:6]</p>
<p>The phrase "be of good cheer" is one of my favorite messages from the Savior. It implies a life of joy, happiness, and optimism based on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our knowledge of the plan of salvation. We know that He lives and loves us and is our advocate with our Father in Heaven. This faith in the Lord and our gratitude for His atoning sacrifice compels us to assist in this great work by bearing our testimony that He is the Son of the living God, that this is His work, and that He will come again.</p>
<p>We cannot be slackers in our commitment to the Lord, in our effort to be an example of His teaching, or in our desire to share what we have with those with whom we have contact. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our gratitude for His sacrifice for us compels us to serve by bearing testimony of Him, even Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. May we do this by our example and our performance, knowing we need not fear but can have courage because the Lord is with us and will stand by us. May the Lord bless each of us as we strive to serve.</p>
<p>Let us strive to be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. I invite you to join me in trying to be a little bit better in His service.</p>
<p>I leave with you my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, our Heavenly Father. This is His work, and we are called to the work because we love Him, our Redeemer. Be of good cheer is my prayer for all of us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am honored to have the chance to speak to you today.
As you probably know, we are under attack by hackers and others seeking to steal our online identities or information. Some attacks in the news recently included Target, Home Depot, Sony, and the IRS. In one of the largest attacks, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management reported the theft of sensitive information from twenty-two million people - virtually anyone who had undergone a government background check in the last fifteen years. In addition, there are lots of online scams just waiting to trap us.
We are also under spiritual attack. As stated in 2 Nephi 2:27, Satan and his followers are doing everything that is possible to make us "miserable like unto" them. Brigham Young said:
It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise.1
Recently President Thomas S. Monson stated, "Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and its growing ever wider."2 However, as threatening as this may seem, we also have been promised spiritual protection. Today I am going to speak about some ways to improve our computer-security behavior, and I am going to offer some spiritual-behavior tips to keep us safe spiritually. While neither of these lists is complete, they are a good place to start.
Security Warnings and Habituation
As was mentioned, I am a professor in the Information Systems Department. I do research at the intersection of neuroscience and behavioral information security. Basically, my research team and I study what is going on in peoples brains when they are interacting with security messages.
We have discovered some interesting things about how and why people behave the way they do in a computer-security setting. Our research shows that when computer users are exposed to a security message more than once, on the second - and on any following - repetition, the brain saves energy by relying on memory rather than visually processing that security message on subsequent viewings.
The region at the back of the brain, called the occipital lobe, is responsible for visual processing and is one of the main areas in which we saw a decreased response over the repetitions. As you can guess, this is problematic because we are tuning out these messages without really seeing them. We have developed some variations on the security messages, and these variations cause the computer users brains to pay attention. In this way - working with biology instead of against it - we can make users more secure by changing the software rather than by increasing the training for users.
In a sense, this habituation to se</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of Gods greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a hearts electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.
When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!
Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.
Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The hearts valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!
In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.
It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.
In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israels new king. As he looked over each of Jesses sons, the Lord taught Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).
Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had "a beautiful countenance" and that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]" (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).
In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Every April the Area Seventies from throughout the world gather in Salt Lake City, along with the General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies, for instruction from members of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presidency of the Seventy. The instruction focuses on the most fundamental and most pressing issues of the Church - things like temple work, strengthening members, the Atonement, and hastening the work of salvation. It is a privilege to sit at the feet of these inspired leaders and to learn what is on their minds and in their hearts.
Two years ago, in April 2013, President Thomas S. Monson addressed the group and spent all of his time talking about just one topic: you - the youth of the Church. Think about that. Of all the important things that President Monson could have addressed - missionary work, temples, or Church leadership - he said that it was the youth of the Church that had been on his mind the most. He noted that as youth today, you are living in a time of infinite promise, a time when you will face unique challenges. He observed that you are truly a royal generation, reserved to come forth in this special time for particular purposes.
President Monsons remarks reminded me of two comments made by Elder Neal A. Maxwell. Speaking to youth at a BYU fireside a number of years ago, Elder Maxwell said:
The highest compliment I can pay to you is that God has placed you here and now at this time to serve in his kingdom; so much is about to happen in which you will be involved and concerning which you will have some great influence.1
In another setting Elder Maxwell provided some additional context for that statement. Referring to the early days of this dispensation, he stated:
The Church has done many difficult things, and from these achievements one would not wish to detract. But all the easy things the Church has had to do have been done. From now on it is high adventure!2
Now, Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the case. Those early stalwart Church members faced challenges that were daunting - challenges that would test the souls of the most valiant of us. However, Elder Maxwell did say that all the "easy things" that needed to be done have been done. "From now on, it is high adventure!" You have been reserved to come to earth at this time of high adventure because God knows you are capable of meeting the challenges which that adventure will bring.
Today I would like to discuss with you a few ideas about what you might do to prepare yourselves to successfully encounter the high adventure that lies ahead of you, both individually and as members of Gods kingdom here on earth.
My advice begins with a scriptural admonition, one that some of you will recognize as the Young Men and Young Women theme from two years ago: "Stand in holy p</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am honored to speak to you today, but first I need to deal with that quizzical look on your faces about my last name. Yes, it really is Money, and yes, I really am a professor at the business school. It was even better when I worked at the bank. My colleagues would say, "Mr. Moneys here now; we can open the vault."
A reporter from the Wall Street Journal called a few years ago to interview me for a story she was doing about professors whose fields fit their names, like a Dr. Payne she had found at a dental school. She asked, but I assured her I was not going to name a daughter Penny. The story was indeed published on the front page of the Wall Street Journal as one of those "fun" stories. So there you have it - how I managed to use up a few minutes of my fame in this life.
Now we can move on. Devotionals are a special part of being at BYU, and I commend you for taking advantage of the opportunity to learn and to grow, in spite of the fact that I am the one speaking today. Devotionals help you think about the difference between things that are really important and things that are not.
When I was asked to speak, I asked my kids, several of whom are BYU students, what I should talk about. We were at the dinner table, and my nephew was visiting. He said, "Hey, thats easy. If you want to play to the crowd, just talk about dating."
Well, I am not going to talk about dating, but I am going to talk about something very important to me, and I believe it is important to you - that is, how you, as a member of this global church, can stay within the borders and be a strong citizen of "the Lords country and kingdom" (which phrase I will explain a little later), no matter where you come from or travel to - Moscow, Russia, or Moscow, Idaho, or any one of the seventeen small towns in the United States named Paris, or even the one in France. Just as with citizenship in temporal countries, you need a passport for the Lords country and kingdom; I will talk about how to stamp that passport and keep it valid.
Before doing that, however, let me just say a word about getting out of Provo. If the world is our campus, then we need to get out there on that campus. I was introduced as director of the Global Management Center, overseeing the international activities of the Marriott School. I love BYU international experiences. A few weeks ago I attended a reunion of the London study abroad program on which I was a student; that program started thirty-three years ago this month. Amazingly, many of us still keep in touch. I have directed many study abroad programs of my own as a faculty member, and I love to see the growth in students as their horizons expand.
Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice gave a forum speech on this campus a few years ago; a major theme of her remarks was this: while a student at BYU, you need to learn a language, leave Provo, and do some studying abr</span>
