  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="At some point after my first couple of years at BYU, a brother in my ward, who was retired from the BYU religion faculty, said, “Hey, you could speak at a devotional!”

I don’t know why he thought I might be qualified for that, but I shrugged it off, thinking that if I sang often enough, I would surely be exempt from speaking. Just recently I had the thought that since I have been at BYU for ten years, I might need to lay low to dodge the devotional bullet.

However, six weeks ago I received an email from Vice President Matt Richardson asking if I would be willing to speak at this devotional. I reluctantly replied that I would accept the challenge, though I am not sure that “happily” would describe my attitude.

As I prayed for guidance on a topic, this thought came to me: “I am a reluctant grower.” I had never used that term before, though it seemed to suit me well, so I can only guess that the Spirit had coined that phrase just for me.

Needing clarification on that phrase, I went to Google for a precise definition of &lt;i&gt;reluctant&lt;/i&gt;. It said that &lt;i&gt;reluctant&lt;/i&gt; is an adjective that means “unwilling and hesitant; disinclined.” Its synonyms include being “loath to, unwilling to, disinclined to, indisposed to; not in favor of, against, opposed to.” It’s antonyms include being “willing” and “eager.” The word &lt;i&gt;reluctant&lt;/i&gt; originated in the mid-seventeenth century from the Latin word &lt;i&gt;reluctant,&lt;/i&gt; which means “struggling against,” and from the verb &lt;i&gt;reluctari:&lt;/i&gt; the prefix &lt;i&gt;re-&lt;/i&gt; means “expressing intensive force” and the suffix &lt;i&gt;luctari&lt;/i&gt; means “to struggle.” As a side note, the word ­&lt;i&gt;reluctant &lt;/i&gt;is worth eleven points in Scrabble.

Am I, as this definition says, unwilling, hesitant, and even disinclined to grow? I will refer to myself, since I am confessing that I am a reluctant grower, but feel free to insert your name where applicable.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I Reluctant?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What is it that sometimes makes me hesitant to face a growing opportunity? I am not against hard work. I bore both of my children while pursuing a doctorate, working two jobs, singing operas on the main stage at Indiana University (one of the top music schools in the country), and maintaining a 3.9 GPA. No, I am not opposed to hard work.

Is it that I am not wanting to participate in activities? I am more than willing to fulfill my callings, go visiting teaching, take a dinner—that likely my good husband expertly cooked—to another family, or participate in my ward’s day of service. No, I am willing to do things that are asked of me.

Am I afraid of the process of growing? Many times while sitting in Relief Society I will hear a sister say, “I prayed for patience” or “I prayed for charity.”

I think, “Are you crazy?! Do you not know what challenges come when you pray for Christlike attributes?”

They then proceed to tell of the tragic circumstances that occurred to teach them those lessons.

You won’t catch me praying for godlike qualities. It is hard to grow; it can be painful to grow. Thus it seems my proud and stubborn heart is, indeed, hesitant to grow.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plants, Pots, and Limitations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As I was thinking of growth, my thoughts ­naturally turned to plants. When a potted plant gets root-bound, it has run out of room in its current pot. The roots cannot continue to grow, the soil is compact and depleted, and the plant is ­stagnant in its current state. When a plant is repotted, the roots are broken up, fresh soil is added, and the plant is placed in a larger pot.

Sometimes the plant does not immediately take to its new condition. I have a plant in my office that was recently repotted, and it looks rather sad with its yellowing, drooping leaves. It may take a while for the plant to adapt, to send out new roots, and to resume growing. However, in time the growth, which is so subtle in the moment, can be monumental. Eight and a half years ago we received as a housewarming gift from a dear friend a plant in a pot that was about a foot in diameter. The same plant is now in a pot just over two feet in diameter. The growth was slow—but ­exponential over time.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Difference Between Doing and Being&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We might say that Jonah of the Old Testament was a reluctant grower. When he received a call to preach repentance in Nineveh, he fled from the Lord, was tossed into the raging sea, was swallowed by a whale, and was then vomited onto land three days later. At that point he &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; needed to go to Nineveh to preach. And so he went.

When Jonah told the people of Nineveh to repent, they did—with their whole hearts. Yet Jonah, who had just experienced the Lord’s mercy, did not accept their penitent state and sat back to watch Nineveh be destroyed. He was then chastened by the Lord for his disregard for the souls of men.

Jonah was reluctant in many ways. But had he not been, he could have avoided the whole whale and vomiting episode and just gone straight to Nineveh.

Laman and Lemuel were clearly reluctant growers. They were even visited and rebuked by an angel, yet seemingly five minutes after an angel left, they resumed their complaining.

In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.31?lang=eng#30&quot;&gt;1 Nephi 3:31&lt;/a&gt; we read:

&lt;i&gt; And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?&lt;/i&gt;

They were slow to learn and quick to forget the lesson.

In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng&quot;&gt;1 Nephi 16&lt;/a&gt; alone, Laman and Lemuel repeated three times the cycle of murmuring, being humbled, and repenting. The last time was after Ishmael had died and Ishmael’s daughters (Laman’s wife and Lemuel’s wife) were mourning. Laman and Lemuel even came to the point in which they conspired together:

&lt;i&gt; And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.37?lang=eng#36&quot;&gt;1 Nephi 16:37&lt;/a&gt;]

&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is definitely reluctance to grow.

A common thread with these examples is that while each person was willing to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; something, they were not willing to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; something. Jonah did go to Nineveh and preach repentance. Laman and Lemuel did go back to obtain the brass plates, and they did go to the promised land. But none of them appear to have changed who they were.

I have learned that Heavenly Father does not just want me to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; something; He wants me to &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; something. When I am striving to become, my heart will turn toward the things that I must do.

Elder David A. Bednar taught:

&lt;i&gt; The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through the Savior’s Atonement. True conversion brings a change in one’s beliefs, heart, and life to accept and conform to the will of God . . .  and includes a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ. &lt;/i&gt;[“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord?lang=eng&quot;&gt;Converted unto the Lord&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2012]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lessons from My Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Let me share a few opportunities for growth that Heavenly Father has thrust upon me.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Unexpected Mission Call&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
I had always wanted to serve a mission. I grew up in Orem, Utah, and went to college in Arkansas. As I awaited my mission call, I was sure that with all of my language training and with my vocal skills I would be assigned to an exciting, exotic place—maybe even a place where I could make connections to later begin my fabulous ­operatic career!

I was at the University of Arkansas, where a mission call was an anomaly among my peers, so many waited with anticipation to see where I might go. I was assigned to the Utah Ogden Mission, speaking English.

I was almost embarrassed to tell anyone, but of course I went. Heavenly Father needed me to learn that in order to serve Him, I needed to be humble, and here was a small dose of humility just to get me started.

I spent most of my time on my mission in very small towns in Idaho and Wyoming, and I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; the people from my mission! I learned so many important things and grew my testimony like never before. And that mission location directly affected my post-mission plans and my ­subsequent life course, including where I eventually went to graduate school and met my husband.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Invitation for Greater Spirituality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
A few years ago I was invited to serve on the BYU Women’s Conference Committee. You may have noticed the 15,000 women on campus last month. That really had been my only experience with Women’s Conference prior to this invitation. But I felt strongly about the divinity of women and was happy to help with the planning.

It did not take long for me to see that this was not a typical university assignment. The committee was composed of women from the campus, from the community, and from the Church general boards. I found myself resistant to being a part of this company of women. What did I have to offer? I was not like them: I did not have a wardrobe of cute, coordinated jackets, and my hair was very long and somewhat unruly—not in the accepted style!

As the semester went on, and as these ­remarkable women accepted me with open arms, I began to realize that what I really desired was to be like them. I wanted to delve into the scriptures as they did and draw upon the Spirit as they did. I had to painfully look into myself to see that I was reluctant to be repotted. But if I was to become a woman of God, I needed to allow myself to become more and to be uprooted; I needed to dig a little deeper. I softened my heart and allowed myself to grow, with great gratitude to those beautiful examples on that committee. And I believe my hairstyle is getting closer.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Study Abroad Experience in Vienna&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The BYU School of Music sponsors a study abroad program in Vienna, Austria, each spring term. I had never had a study abroad experience as a student or as a faculty member, and I had never been to Austria—or even to much of Europe. I really wanted this experience for myself and even more for my family.

In August 2015 I emailed the new director of the School of Music to let him know I would like to lead this program sometime.

He immediately replied, “How about this next spring term?”

Again I hesitated. That was only eight months away! I had no idea how to do anything in a study abroad program, but I knew that it would be a lot of work. And I did not speak German. What was I thinking?

But my husband, Steve, who was also anxious for this experience, said, “Reply &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt;!”

As I expected, it was a lot of work to ­prepare for the program. However, the ­experience was even more than I had hoped for. For a ­musician, Vienna—the home of Mozart, Schubert, Johann Strauss, and Beethoven, among others—is a paradise. We heard wonderful concerts and operas. We saw beautiful and historical places throughout Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and England. My teenage children not only experienced Europe but learned that they could face challenging and unknown situations and could learn to adapt—including adapting to haircuts from non–English-speaking Turks. They saw the Church as an international congregation in Vienna and as a branch of twenty in a village in England. All of the participants gained confidence and grew parts of their own testimonies. In addition, we added nineteen wonderful BYU students to our family circle. It was life changing.

I cringe to think that my hesitation might have robbed us of those experiences and of our individual opportunities for growth.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Achieve Maximum Growth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Even as I approached this talk, I thought, “Perhaps I can revamp a previous talk. That won’t be too hard.”

That was not the case. Heavenly Father had yet another painful lesson that I needed to learn about myself: I needed to embrace growth in order to become who He has in mind.

When I fear growth, I must keep in mind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7?lang=eng#6&quot;&gt;2 Timothy 1:7&lt;/a&gt;, which reads:

&lt;i&gt; For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.&lt;/i&gt;

And also, as stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.18,18?lang=eng#17&quot;&gt;1 John 4:18&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;i&gt; There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.&lt;/i&gt;

I cannot fully take advantage of the Atonement of Jesus Christ when I fear or when I am unwilling, because then I am doubting our Savior and the power of His Atonement. But I can repent and grow and eventually be made perfect through the love of our Savior.

When a plant is struggling with growth, we often give it a dose of Miracle-Gro or some other plant food. Miracle-Gro is composed of basic yet fundamental elemental nutrients—nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate.

What might our spiritual Miracle-Gro consist of? What are the spiritual elemental nutrients?
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prayer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
There are many scriptural examples of the power of prayer, but I was drawn to Enos in the Book of Mormon&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; When Enos began to ponder “the words which [he] had often heard [his] father speak concerning eternal life” and his “soul hungered,” he knelt before his Maker and cried in prayer for his own soul (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3,4?lang=eng#2&quot;&gt;Enos 1:3–4&lt;/a&gt;). He prayed all the day long and through the night, and he was changed through long and earnest prayer. If you are not sure where to start on your own journey, begin to pray.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scripture study&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Nephi taught us:

&lt;i&gt; And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 25:26&lt;/a&gt;]

The very purpose of the scriptures is to bring those who read and study them closer to Christ.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fasting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Fasting is another elemental nutrient. When Alma the younger and the sons of Mosiah were reunited after their very long missionary service, they rejoiced in the faithfulness and strength of one another. We read in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2,3?lang=eng#1&quot;&gt;Alma 17:2–3&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;i&gt;For they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt; But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.&lt;/i&gt;

Jesus Christ fasted for forty days and nights to prepare Himself for His ministry. Fasting with prayer endows us with the Spirit and with power from on high.

These very basic yet fundamental elements—prayer, scripture study, and fasting—will ignite our faith, nourish our souls, and give root for change and growth.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humility Through Life’s Hurdles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
When a challenge is before us, it is not required that we conquer that challenge with ease. We may not even possess the skills to accomplish the task before us. All that Heavenly Father requires is prescribed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng#19&quot;&gt;3 Nephi 9:20&lt;/a&gt;: “And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.”

Elder Bruce D. Porter of the Quorum of the Seventy taught:

&lt;i&gt;Those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit are willing to do anything and everything that God asks of them, without resistance or resentment. We cease doing things our way and learn to do them God’s way instead. In such a condition of submissiveness, the Atonement can take effect and true repentance can occur. &lt;/i&gt;[“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/a-broken-heart-and-a-contrite-spirit?lang=eng&quot;&gt;A Broken Heart and a Contrite Spirit&lt;/a&gt;,”&lt;i&gt; Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;November 2007]

Having a broken heart that is willing to do the Lord’s will does not make us weak or insufficient. Instead it helps us to be humble in our mortality and to recognize that we need heavenly help to face life’s challenges. We are promised in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26&quot;&gt;Ether 12:27&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;i&gt; And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.&lt;/i&gt;

It is our humility and reliance upon God that give us the ability to overcome and grow.

And here is one more reason why we need never fear any task that is laid before us:

W&lt;i&gt;herefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.6?lang=eng#5&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 68:6&lt;/a&gt;]

I don’t know about you, but when I am facing life’s hurdles, I want and need to be strengthened by the Lord. I am grateful that He has promised that He will stand by me. And with that promise, I can exercise my faith and feel peace and security in letting my heart become broken in order to grow.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Returning Home Willingly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I do have a deep desire to be a disciple of Christ. And as Elder Bednar advised, we each must make “a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ.”

So just as I have confessed to being a reluctant grower, I now pledge to you—and maybe with you—and to my Heavenly Father that I do not choose to be like Laman and Lemuel. Instead I choose to be like Nephi, to “go and do” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7?lang=eng#6&quot;&gt;1 Nephi 3:7&lt;/a&gt;) and, more important, to &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; what the Lord commands.

Ultimately, I am always grateful for the growth that comes from hard things. Just like my root-bound house plants, I have the need to let my compacted roots be broken up and be repotted into rich soil that will allow me to stretch, be nourished, and become something more. I treasure the lessons I have learned through challenges, including what I have learned while preparing this address.

I know that my Heavenly Father loves me and that He loves you. I know that He sees fit to help us become worthy to return to His presence someday. I am grateful for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, which allows me to repent, change, grow, and correct my course so that I can willingly—not reluctantly—return to my Heavenly Father.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>At some point after my first couple of years at BYU, a brother in my ward, who was retired from the BYU religion faculty, said, “Hey, you could speak at a devotional!”</p>
<p>I don’t know why he thought I might be qualified for that, but I shrugged it off, thinking that if I sang often enough, I would surely be exempt from speaking. Just recently I had the thought that since I have been at BYU for ten years, I might need to lay low to dodge the devotional bullet.</p>
<p>However, six weeks ago I received an email from Vice President Matt Richardson asking if I would be willing to speak at this devotional. I reluctantly replied that I would accept the challenge, though I am not sure that “happily” would describe my attitude.</p>
<p>As I prayed for guidance on a topic, this thought came to me: “I am a reluctant grower.” I had never used that term before, though it seemed to suit me well, so I can only guess that the Spirit had coined that phrase just for me.</p>
<p>Needing clarification on that phrase, I went to Google for a precise definition of <i>reluctant</i>. It said that <i>reluctant</i> is an adjective that means “unwilling and hesitant; disinclined.” Its synonyms include being “loath to, unwilling to, disinclined to, indisposed to; not in favor of, against, opposed to.” It’s antonyms include being “willing” and “eager.” The word <i>reluctant</i> originated in the mid-seventeenth century from the Latin word <i>reluctant,</i> which means “struggling against,” and from the verb <i>reluctari:</i> the prefix <i>re-</i> means “expressing intensive force” and the suffix <i>luctari</i> means “to struggle.” As a side note, the word ­<i>reluctant </i>is worth eleven points in Scrabble.</p>
<p>Am I, as this definition says, unwilling, hesitant, and even disinclined to grow? I will refer to myself, since I am confessing that I am a reluctant grower, but feel free to insert your name where applicable.</p>
<h2><b>Am I Reluctant?</b></h2>
<p>What is it that sometimes makes me hesitant to face a growing opportunity? I am not against hard work. I bore both of my children while pursuing a doctorate, working two jobs, singing operas on the main stage at Indiana University (one of the top music schools in the country), and maintaining a 3.9 GPA. No, I am not opposed to hard work.</p>
<p>Is it that I am not wanting to participate in activities? I am more than willing to fulfill my callings, go visiting teaching, take a dinner—that likely my good husband expertly cooked—to another family, or participate in my ward’s day of service. No, I am willing to do things that are asked of me.</p>
<p>Am I afraid of the process of growing? Many times while sitting in Relief Society I will hear a sister say, “I prayed for patience” or “I prayed for charity.”</p>
<p>I think, “Are you crazy?! Do you not know what challenges come when you pray for Christlike attributes?”</p>
<p>They then proceed to tell of the tragic circumstances that occurred to teach them those lessons.</p>
<p>You won’t catch me praying for godlike qualities. It is hard to grow; it can be painful to grow. Thus it seems my proud and stubborn heart is, indeed, hesitant to grow.</p>
<h2><b>Plants, Pots, and Limitations</b></h2>
<p>As I was thinking of growth, my thoughts ­naturally turned to plants. When a potted plant gets root-bound, it has run out of room in its current pot. The roots cannot continue to grow, the soil is compact and depleted, and the plant is ­stagnant in its current state. When a plant is repotted, the roots are broken up, fresh soil is added, and the plant is placed in a larger pot.</p>
<p>Sometimes the plant does not immediately take to its new condition. I have a plant in my office that was recently repotted, and it looks rather sad with its yellowing, drooping leaves. It may take a while for the plant to adapt, to send out new roots, and to resume growing. However, in time the growth, which is so subtle in the moment, can be monumental. Eight and a half years ago we received as a housewarming gift from a dear friend a plant in a pot that was about a foot in diameter. The same plant is now in a pot just over two feet in diameter. The growth was slow—but ­exponential over time.</p>
<h2><b>The Difference Between Doing and Being</b></h2>
<p>We might say that Jonah of the Old Testament was a reluctant grower. When he received a call to preach repentance in Nineveh, he fled from the Lord, was tossed into the raging sea, was swallowed by a whale, and was then vomited onto land three days later. At that point he <i>still</i> needed to go to Nineveh to preach. And so he went.</p>
<p>When Jonah told the people of Nineveh to repent, they did—with their whole hearts. Yet Jonah, who had just experienced the Lord’s mercy, did not accept their penitent state and sat back to watch Nineveh be destroyed. He was then chastened by the Lord for his disregard for the souls of men.</p>
<p>Jonah was reluctant in many ways. But had he not been, he could have avoided the whole whale and vomiting episode and just gone straight to Nineveh.</p>
<p>Laman and Lemuel were clearly reluctant growers. They were even visited and rebuked by an angel, yet seemingly five minutes after an angel left, they resumed their complaining.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.31?lang=eng#30">1 Nephi 3:31</a> we read:</p>
<p><i> And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?</i></p>
<p>They were slow to learn and quick to forget the lesson.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng">1 Nephi 16</a> alone, Laman and Lemuel repeated three times the cycle of murmuring, being humbled, and repenting. The last time was after Ishmael had died and Ishmael’s daughters (Laman’s wife and Lemuel’s wife) were mourning. Laman and Lemuel even came to the point in which they conspired together:</p>
<p><i> And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.37?lang=eng#36">1 Nephi 16:37</a>]</p>
<p><i>That</i> is definitely reluctance to grow.</p>
<p>A common thread with these examples is that while each person was willing to <i>do</i> something, they were not willing to <i>be</i> something. Jonah did go to Nineveh and preach repentance. Laman and Lemuel did go back to obtain the brass plates, and they did go to the promised land. But none of them appear to have changed who they were.</p>
<p>I have learned that Heavenly Father does not just want me to <i>do</i> something; He wants me to <i>become</i> something. When I am striving to become, my heart will turn toward the things that I must do.</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar taught:</p>
<p><i> The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through the Savior’s Atonement. True conversion brings a change in one’s beliefs, heart, and life to accept and conform to the will of God . . .  and includes a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ. </i>[“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord?lang=eng">Converted unto the Lord</a>,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 2012]</p>
<h2><b>Lessons from My Life</b></h2>
<p>Let me share a few opportunities for growth that Heavenly Father has thrust upon me.</p>
<h3><b><i>An Unexpected Mission Call</i></b></h3>
<p>I had always wanted to serve a mission. I grew up in Orem, Utah, and went to college in Arkansas. As I awaited my mission call, I was sure that with all of my language training and with my vocal skills I would be assigned to an exciting, exotic place—maybe even a place where I could make connections to later begin my fabulous ­operatic career!</p>
<p>I was at the University of Arkansas, where a mission call was an anomaly among my peers, so many waited with anticipation to see where I might go. I was assigned to the Utah Ogden Mission, speaking English.</p>
<p>I was almost embarrassed to tell anyone, but of course I went. Heavenly Father needed me to learn that in order to serve Him, I needed to be humble, and here was a small dose of humility just to get me started.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time on my mission in very small towns in Idaho and Wyoming, and I <i>love</i> the people from my mission! I learned so many important things and grew my testimony like never before. And that mission location directly affected my post-mission plans and my ­subsequent life course, including where I eventually went to graduate school and met my husband.</p>
<h3><b><i>An Invitation for Greater Spirituality</i></b></h3>
<p>A few years ago I was invited to serve on the BYU Women’s Conference Committee. You may have noticed the 15,000 women on campus last month. That really had been my only experience with Women’s Conference prior to this invitation. But I felt strongly about the divinity of women and was happy to help with the planning.</p>
<p>It did not take long for me to see that this was not a typical university assignment. The committee was composed of women from the campus, from the community, and from the Church general boards. I found myself resistant to being a part of this company of women. What did I have to offer? I was not like them: I did not have a wardrobe of cute, coordinated jackets, and my hair was very long and somewhat unruly—not in the accepted style!</p>
<p>As the semester went on, and as these ­remarkable women accepted me with open arms, I began to realize that what I really desired was to be like them. I wanted to delve into the scriptures as they did and draw upon the Spirit as they did. I had to painfully look into myself to see that I was reluctant to be repotted. But if I was to become a woman of God, I needed to allow myself to become more and to be uprooted; I needed to dig a little deeper. I softened my heart and allowed myself to grow, with great gratitude to those beautiful examples on that committee. And I believe my hairstyle is getting closer.</p>
<h3><b><i>A Study Abroad Experience in Vienna</i></b></h3>
<p>The BYU School of Music sponsors a study abroad program in Vienna, Austria, each spring term. I had never had a study abroad experience as a student or as a faculty member, and I had never been to Austria—or even to much of Europe. I really wanted this experience for myself and even more for my family.</p>
<p>In August 2015 I emailed the new director of the School of Music to let him know I would like to lead this program sometime.</p>
<p>He immediately replied, “How about this next spring term?”</p>
<p>Again I hesitated. That was only eight months away! I had no idea how to do anything in a study abroad program, but I knew that it would be a lot of work. And I did not speak German. What was I thinking?</p>
<p>But my husband, Steve, who was also anxious for this experience, said, “Reply <i>yes</i>!”</p>
<p>As I expected, it was a lot of work to ­prepare for the program. However, the ­experience was even more than I had hoped for. For a ­musician, Vienna—the home of Mozart, Schubert, Johann Strauss, and Beethoven, among others—is a paradise. We heard wonderful concerts and operas. We saw beautiful and historical places throughout Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and England. My teenage children not only experienced Europe but learned that they could face challenging and unknown situations and could learn to adapt—including adapting to haircuts from non–English-speaking Turks. They saw the Church as an international congregation in Vienna and as a branch of twenty in a village in England. All of the participants gained confidence and grew parts of their own testimonies. In addition, we added nineteen wonderful BYU students to our family circle. It was life changing.</p>
<p>I cringe to think that my hesitation might have robbed us of those experiences and of our individual opportunities for growth.</p>
<h2><b>How to Achieve Maximum Growth</b></h2>
<p>Even as I approached this talk, I thought, “Perhaps I can revamp a previous talk. That won’t be too hard.”</p>
<p>That was not the case. Heavenly Father had yet another painful lesson that I needed to learn about myself: I needed to embrace growth in order to become who He has in mind.</p>
<p>When I fear growth, I must keep in mind <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7?lang=eng#6">2 Timothy 1:7</a>, which reads:</p>
<p><i> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</i></p>
<p>And also, as stated in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.18,18?lang=eng#17">1 John 4:18</a>:</p>
<p><i> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</i></p>
<p>I cannot fully take advantage of the Atonement of Jesus Christ when I fear or when I am unwilling, because then I am doubting our Savior and the power of His Atonement. But I can repent and grow and eventually be made perfect through the love of our Savior.</p>
<p>When a plant is struggling with growth, we often give it a dose of Miracle-Gro or some other plant food. Miracle-Gro is composed of basic yet fundamental elemental nutrients—nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate.</p>
<p>What might our spiritual Miracle-Gro consist of? What are the spiritual elemental nutrients?</p>
<h3><b><i>Prayer</i></b></h3>
<p>There are many scriptural examples of the power of prayer, but I was drawn to Enos in the Book of Mormon<i>.</i> When Enos began to ponder “the words which [he] had often heard [his] father speak concerning eternal life” and his “soul hungered,” he knelt before his Maker and cried in prayer for his own soul (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3,4?lang=eng#2">Enos 1:3–4</a>). He prayed all the day long and through the night, and he was changed through long and earnest prayer. If you are not sure where to start on your own journey, begin to pray.</p>
<h3><b><i>Scripture study</i></b></h3>
<p>Nephi taught us:</p>
<p><i> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25">2 Nephi 25:26</a>]</p>
<p>The very purpose of the scriptures is to bring those who read and study them closer to Christ.</p>
<h3><b><i>Fasting</i></b></h3>
<p>Fasting is another elemental nutrient. When Alma the younger and the sons of Mosiah were reunited after their very long missionary service, they rejoiced in the faithfulness and strength of one another. We read in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2,3?lang=eng#1">Alma 17:2–3</a>:</p>
<p><i>For they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</i></p>
<p><i> But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</i></p>
<p>Jesus Christ fasted for forty days and nights to prepare Himself for His ministry. Fasting with prayer endows us with the Spirit and with power from on high.</p>
<p>These very basic yet fundamental elements—prayer, scripture study, and fasting—will ignite our faith, nourish our souls, and give root for change and growth.</p>
<h2><b>Humility Through Life’s Hurdles</b></h2>
<p>When a challenge is before us, it is not required that we conquer that challenge with ease. We may not even possess the skills to accomplish the task before us. All that Heavenly Father requires is prescribed in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng#19">3 Nephi 9:20</a>: “And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.”</p>
<p>Elder Bruce D. Porter of the Quorum of the Seventy taught:</p>
<p><i>Those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit are willing to do anything and everything that God asks of them, without resistance or resentment. We cease doing things our way and learn to do them God’s way instead. In such a condition of submissiveness, the Atonement can take effect and true repentance can occur. </i>[“<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/a-broken-heart-and-a-contrite-spirit?lang=eng">A Broken Heart and a Contrite Spirit</a>,”<i> Ensign, </i>November 2007]</p>
<p>Having a broken heart that is willing to do the Lord’s will does not make us weak or insufficient. Instead it helps us to be humble in our mortality and to recognize that we need heavenly help to face life’s challenges. We are promised in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26">Ether 12:27</a>:</p>
<p><i> And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i></p>
<p>It is our humility and reliance upon God that give us the ability to overcome and grow.</p>
<p>And here is one more reason why we need never fear any task that is laid before us:</p>
<p>W<i>herefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.6?lang=eng#5">D&amp;C 68:6</a>]</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but when I am facing life’s hurdles, I want and need to be strengthened by the Lord. I am grateful that He has promised that He will stand by me. And with that promise, I can exercise my faith and feel peace and security in letting my heart become broken in order to grow.</p>
<h2><b>Returning Home Willingly</b></h2>
<p>I do have a deep desire to be a disciple of Christ. And as Elder Bednar advised, we each must make “a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ.”</p>
<p>So just as I have confessed to being a reluctant grower, I now pledge to you—and maybe with you—and to my Heavenly Father that I do not choose to be like Laman and Lemuel. Instead I choose to be like Nephi, to “go and do” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7?lang=eng#6">1 Nephi 3:7</a>) and, more important, to <i>become</i> what the Lord commands.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am always grateful for the growth that comes from hard things. Just like my root-bound house plants, I have the need to let my compacted roots be broken up and be repotted into rich soil that will allow me to stretch, be nourished, and become something more. I treasure the lessons I have learned through challenges, including what I have learned while preparing this address.</p>
<p>I know that my Heavenly Father loves me and that He loves you. I know that He sees fit to help us become worthy to return to His presence someday. I am grateful for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, which allows me to repent, change, grow, and correct my course so that I can willingly—not reluctantly—return to my Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many years ago, as a high school ­student, I had the opportunity to become acquainted with several Catholic nuns who lived in a convent in my hometown and worked in the nearby Catholic hospital. As their schedules permitted, I often spent time with them, walking in the park or visiting in the parlor of the convent.
One afternoon I happened to be talking with Sister Columba. She was a tiny, elderly woman who had been a member of the Irish Army before she became a nun. That day she was sharing with me the profound love that she had for our Savior, Jesus Christ, and as she spoke, tears were streaming down her face. It was a powerful spiritual moment that touched me in the deepest center of my being.
After I left that day, I pondered Sister Columba’s testimony of Christ. I had grown up as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I had attended my church meetings and seminary classes. I had frequently borne testimony that the gospel of Jesus Christ was true. And yet I couldn’t comprehend how it could be, with all of this truth, that I had never felt anything for Jesus Christ—certainly nothing like the level of worship and gratitude that I had experienced from Sister Columba.
That afternoon with this frail nun in the quiet parlor of the convent became the definitive moment of my spiritual growth, as it launched a quest to know my Savior that has shaped my entire life. The most critical point, which I have at last come to comprehend, is the absolute centrality of Jesus Christ and His Atonement to every aspect of our lives. Because of that centrality, the most significant challenge for us is to learn to grasp this center and to build our lives upon this secure foundation.
This injunction is nothing new. If we really look at it, this one fact—the centrality of Christ and the Atonement—builds the focus for all the religious instruction that the Church conveys. The question that I have been grappling with is this: Since Christ and His Atonement are so clearly the center toward which all our religious experience leads, why is it often so difficult for us to actually connect with that center and to make it our own in an active way?
Of course there are many ways to answer this question, but today I would like to share some insights that I have found as I have pondered this ­question in my own life.
Mortal Perception and Spiritual Perception
We are born into this world as somewhat awkwardly composite beings in which an eternal spirit has been enclosed in a mortal, physical body. This dividedness comes, I believe, because these two disparate elements—mortal body and eternal spirit—provide us with two distinctly different mechanisms for comprehending the world. I will call these “mortal perception” and “spiritual perception.”
Mortal perception is the means of understanding that is provided by our physical body. This body is equipped with an amazing ar</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a humbling experience to speak with you this morning and to have present friends, family, missionaries, colleagues, and many others. As I reflected on the message I wanted to share today, I was reminded of an experience my mother-in-law, Helen Thomas, had a few years ago. She noticed that her vision was deteriorating. The images she saw were becoming increasingly blurred and faint. Finally she scheduled an eye exam and was told she had cataracts. Fortunately she was able to have corrective surgery, which restored her vision. My mother-in-law was so excited after the operation, she said, “I hadn’t realized how much my eyesight had changed. I have not been able to see this well for years. My vision must have changed just a little bit at a time.”
There are important lessons in this experience for all of us. Thus I will first talk about cataracts and their causes, consequences, and correction. Then I will draw a parallel between the causes and prevention of cataracts with what we might refer to as the causes and prevention of spiritual cataracts.
Now let’s talk about cataracts. Many cataracts begin as small spots or specks in the lens of the eye. These spots interfere with light rays that pass through the lens to be focused as an image on the retina in the back of the eye. The greater the number of specks, the more obscure the image. These specks can become so dense that the entire lens becomes milky white, and the light rays can’t pass through the lens, resulting in blindness. But it is important to remember that the light is still there; it just can’t pass through the lens of the eye.
The effects of cataracts can be illustrated by looking at the stars. If you are high up in the mountains and look at the stars on a clear night, their images are sharp and crystal clear. In a setting like that, it is inspirational to look at the North Star and the numerous other constellations that have fascinated countless generations. However, if you try to look at the same stars from a highly populated area, the stars will appear fuzzy or may seem to disappear because of the physical pollutants in the atmosphere. Just like cataracts in the lens of the eye, the physical pollutants in the atmosphere deflect or block the light rays and obscure the image of the stars so that they appear fuzzy. Even if the light from the stars isn’t visible to the naked eye, the stars are still there.
In the early days of navigation, the North Star was used to guide ships to their desired destinations. However, this was not possible when the skies were overcast. Just as those sailors were without guidance on overcast nights, those with severe cataracts miss many things. They may not be able to see the vibrant fall colors on a drive up the canyon or see the excited smile on the face of a newly baptized member of the Church or see the radiant glow of a new bride as she kneels at the altar in the temple. Cataracts, if left uncorrec</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a special time for you as students in terms of the calendar, brothers and sisters. A new semester has started. Obviously it is the end of one year and the beginning of another. Soon it will be the end of a century, and a whole new century will open up before you. And you really are, as we enter upon that new century, part of the hope of Israel. So I am grateful for President Bateman’s invitation to be with you in this time of transition, and I will, with some encouragement from my wife and some others, wax a little bit autobiographical today, which I typically don’t do.
My life has been, fortunately—for me at least—intertwined with Brigham Young University for nearly 28 years: either as Church commissioner of education, as a member of the board of trustees, as chairman of the executive committee, or off and on as the grandfather of several students here. No wonder, therefore, that I feel that President Bateman and the faculty and administration are truly colleagues.
Furthermore, you as students continue to be, at least to me, another royal generation being raised up for the purposes of the Lord in your individual lives. Yes, you have some personal imperfections of which you are aware, probably painfully at times. But you are also drenched in personal gifts, talents, and abilities of which you may be less aware. So though longevity is one reason for giving some advice today, the other reason for so doing is because of your immense possibilities carved out of this particular time in human history.
It surprises me that I have lived nearly three-fourths of the 20th century. Such a span is not comparatively a long time, considering the able and spritely septagenarians and octogenarians among whom I labor. Yet it is still a significant time span. Certainly at times in the spring of 1945, as an 18-year-old infantryman on Okinawa, it did not look very likely to me that my life would span three-quarters of this century. Nevertheless, experiences undergone and lessons learned have combined over the years to heighten my gratitude to God for the gift of life. I have lived through a depression, a world war, and a cold war, and have long since entered my anecdotage—and you will not be entirely spared from that latter symptom today.
In the passing years I have developed much appreciation for the institution of the family. Other institutions simply cannot compensate fully for failing families. If we will hold fast to the Church’s proclamation on the family, we will see that we hold the jewels, as it were, that can enrich so many other things. Let the world go its own way on the family. It appears to be determined to do that. But we do not have that option. Our doctrines and teachings on the family are very, very powerful, and they are full of implications for all the people on this planet.
Though I murmured as a young man at times with chores, I have acquired in the space of this passage of time a hardened </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful to be with you. Those who speak to you sometimes ask for your prayers to sustain them in their efforts. I ask that of you tonight with a special urgency and for a specific purpose.
Years ago I served as the bishop of a ward composed of young people. Time has wiped away much of what I learned then of their sorrows and mistakes, but I can still see in my mind most of their faces. I meet some of them as I travel about the world. Their faces and their physiques have been changed enough by time that I sometimes stumble trying to remember names. Others I have followed more closely, with a chance to know what life has offered them. When I learn of their lives, I am amazed at the variety of their experiences. Each life seems to be unique. About all they have in common, as nearly as I can tell, is that they have been surprised by the pattern of the tests of their faith. The surprise has come because they could not know when the tests would come, what they would be, nor how long they would last.
For a few, the tests are over. For some of the members of that ward, the tests ended early. I was reminded of one young man the other day. For me his face will always be young and bright with hope. He left our ward for a mission in Japan. Decades later I mentioned his name in a talk I gave to a group of Latter-day Saints in Tokyo. After the meeting a number of members came to me, their faces shining with the brightness that I remember in his face when he returned from his mission. They told that he was “their” missionary. If I understood their English, they said that he was the greatest missionary they had ever known.
I was released as the bishop when our family was asked to move to another state. I kept track of that missionary enough to know that he had graduated from college, applied to medical school, and been accepted. I did not know his plans for the summer before he began medical school, but I am sure that he looked forward with great anticipation to the years ahead.
A phone rang where we then lived, and I learned that he had been killed. He and friends had gone to climb a peak in the Wind River Range in the western United States. I was invited to speak at his funeral. I asked some of the young men who had been climbing with him, friends from our old ward family, to meet me at the chapel where the service would begin in a few minutes. We went to a room to be alone. After we had renewed our acquaintance, I asked if they would tell me something about our friend’s life. I think they knew why.
I wished to speak in the funeral about him and his life. They knew how much I had admired him. They also knew that I had not seen him nor spoken with him for a few years. They knew that I wanted to praise him but that the praise had to be true.
They told me this story: They had camped the night in preparation for the ascent to the peak. As they climbed, high on the face of the mountain, a storm came upon them</span>
