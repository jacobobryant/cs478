  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am grateful for the privilege of celebrating this long-awaited day not only with those of you graduating but also with your teachers, supervisors, parents, families, and friends. They, too, have experienced great anticipation for what this rite of passage signifies for those of you who have achieved the recognition identified in the program of the day. We all add our congratulations and best wishes, which we will appropriately repeat not only today and tomorrow but also on occasion throughout your lives. It is a great honor to participate with all who are involved and have contributed to the cause for this great celebration.

As is usually the case with the graduating class, there is not only diversity in background, disciplines studied, and future plans but also great consistency in the basic goodness and extraordinary capacity for accomplishment and service in those we honor. As I have the opportunity to reflect on the significant collective attainments of this wonderful group we honor today - and also on what you will yet achieve in your personal lives and in service to families, churches, communities, and nations - I find great evidence for confidence in the future. I am satisfied that the tremendous investment made in your BYU education by you students, your families, the faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and our loyal and generous donors is more than justified. In this we are reminded of the scriptural injunction familiar to all of us: "For of him [or her] unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). In more casual discourse, we occasionally hear it said that "where much is given, much is expected." While still true, the scriptural wording is stronger and clearer. Inherent in all that we do at BYU is the expectation and even the mandate that the efforts of students, professors, family members, friends, tithe payers, and thoughtful donors will all bear productive and valuable fruit.

Hopefully we are clear that the confidence and blessings bestowed upon us as the result of our BYU experience raises much more than a suggestion that we will "go forth to serve" with commitment, effectiveness, and appreciation. While I have not visited with all of you by any means, I am satisfied by my interactions with many that you both understand and are fully committed to contribute a high return on the investment made in each of you. Thank you for your goodness, your devotion, and your determination to fulfill your great potential in making the world a better place. I am very pleased to recognize and endorse to Elder Dallin H. Oaks and his associates on our board of trustees your present and future contributions.

In accord with the prophecies made about this institution by our Church leaders from the very beginning of our institution, Brigham Young University is progressing toward the goal of becoming the very fine university prophetic predictions have envisioned. While still needing to do many more things better than we do them today, we are now consistently in the top ten in this nation of all baccalaureate degreegranting institutions in producing graduates who go on to earn PhD degrees as well as professional degrees in dentistry, law, and medicine in addition to other fields. Our students and faculty continue to be widely recognized and saluted for their integrity and accomplishments.

But there are also some very important things about BYU that have not changed and must never change. In the remarkable history of our first one hundred years by Wilkinson and Skousen entitled&lt;i&gt;Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny,&lt;/i&gt; I read the following statement:

&lt;i&gt;Certainly one of the most distinguishing features of Brigham Young Academy was the attention it gave to teaching, as part of the daily curriculum, the doctrines, practices, and principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The original 1875 deed of trust provided that "the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants shall be read and their doctrines inculcated in the Academy." The deed and grant of property of 1 June 1877 also provided that "no book shall be used therein that misrepresents, or speaks lightly of the Divine Mission of our Savior, or of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or in any manner advances ideas antagonistic to the principles of the Gospel." These instructions were strictly followed.&lt;/i&gt; [Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen, &lt;i&gt;Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny&lt;/i&gt; (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), 106]

And, I add, they continue to be.

This coming week we will be visited on campus by an accrediting team from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. As a campus community and in our preparation for our report and this visit, we have spent considerable time and effort studying the BYU Aims and Mission statements. While eloquent and possessing more detail than that found in the statement I just read, the fundamentals and basics have not changed. From the very beginning BYU has been an institution that has done its best to "be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service" (&lt;i&gt;The Mission of Brigham Young University&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Aims of a BYU Education&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).

It is our prayer and aspiration for each of you as you complete this BYU experience that you will continually keep the mission and aims of your BYU education front and center in your minds and in your hearts so that they are inextricably connected with who and what you are. May this ever be so for each of us, I humbly pray and testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I am grateful for the privilege of celebrating this long-awaited day not only with those of you graduating but also with your teachers, supervisors, parents, families, and friends. They, too, have experienced great anticipation for what this rite of passage signifies for those of you who have achieved the recognition identified in the program of the day. We all add our congratulations and best wishes, which we will appropriately repeat not only today and tomorrow but also on occasion throughout your lives. It is a great honor to participate with all who are involved and have contributed to the cause for this great celebration.</p>
<p>As is usually the case with the graduating class, there is not only diversity in background, disciplines studied, and future plans but also great consistency in the basic goodness and extraordinary capacity for accomplishment and service in those we honor. As I have the opportunity to reflect on the significant collective attainments of this wonderful group we honor today - and also on what you will yet achieve in your personal lives and in service to families, churches, communities, and nations - I find great evidence for confidence in the future. I am satisfied that the tremendous investment made in your BYU education by you students, your families, the faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and our loyal and generous donors is more than justified. In this we are reminded of the scriptural injunction familiar to all of us: "For of him [or her] unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;C 82:3). In more casual discourse, we occasionally hear it said that "where much is given, much is expected." While still true, the scriptural wording is stronger and clearer. Inherent in all that we do at BYU is the expectation and even the mandate that the efforts of students, professors, family members, friends, tithe payers, and thoughtful donors will all bear productive and valuable fruit.</p>
<p>Hopefully we are clear that the confidence and blessings bestowed upon us as the result of our BYU experience raises much more than a suggestion that we will "go forth to serve" with commitment, effectiveness, and appreciation. While I have not visited with all of you by any means, I am satisfied by my interactions with many that you both understand and are fully committed to contribute a high return on the investment made in each of you. Thank you for your goodness, your devotion, and your determination to fulfill your great potential in making the world a better place. I am very pleased to recognize and endorse to Elder Dallin H. Oaks and his associates on our board of trustees your present and future contributions.</p>
<p>In accord with the prophecies made about this institution by our Church leaders from the very beginning of our institution, Brigham Young University is progressing toward the goal of becoming the very fine university prophetic predictions have envisioned. While still needing to do many more things better than we do them today, we are now consistently in the top ten in this nation of all baccalaureate degreegranting institutions in producing graduates who go on to earn PhD degrees as well as professional degrees in dentistry, law, and medicine in addition to other fields. Our students and faculty continue to be widely recognized and saluted for their integrity and accomplishments.</p>
<p>But there are also some very important things about BYU that have not changed and must never change. In the remarkable history of our first one hundred years by Wilkinson and Skousen entitled<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny,</i> I read the following statement:</p>
<p><i>Certainly one of the most distinguishing features of Brigham Young Academy was the attention it gave to teaching, as part of the daily curriculum, the doctrines, practices, and principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The original 1875 deed of trust provided that "the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants shall be read and their doctrines inculcated in the Academy." The deed and grant of property of 1 June 1877 also provided that "no book shall be used therein that misrepresents, or speaks lightly of the Divine Mission of our Savior, or of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or in any manner advances ideas antagonistic to the principles of the Gospel." These instructions were strictly followed.</i> [Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen, <i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), 106]</p>
<p>And, I add, they continue to be.</p>
<p>This coming week we will be visited on campus by an accrediting team from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. As a campus community and in our preparation for our report and this visit, we have spent considerable time and effort studying the BYU Aims and Mission statements. While eloquent and possessing more detail than that found in the statement I just read, the fundamentals and basics have not changed. From the very beginning BYU has been an institution that has done its best to "be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).</p>
<p>It is our prayer and aspiration for each of you as you complete this BYU experience that you will continually keep the mission and aims of your BYU education front and center in your minds and in your hearts so that they are inextricably connected with who and what you are. May this ever be so for each of us, I humbly pray and testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with antiVietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building" (I hope) and a preparation for "(4) lifelong learning and service."1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, "Can we do that?"
She responded quizzically, "You do know this is a Church school, dont you?"
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline "Remember when; remember why." We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelors degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: "Be awful." Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. "Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations"2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the thirteenth century the word silly meant "worthy, good," and "pious, holy."3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to "innocent" or "harmless," then to "deserving of pity or sympathy," to "weak/feeble," then to "ignorant." By the sixteenth century it had descended to "foolish," its current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was "awe-inspiring," "worthy of . . . respect," and "profoundly respectful or reverential."5 But as one author explained, "Since what inspires awe isnt always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative."6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean "terrible, dreadful, appalling"; something not just bad but "exceedingly bad."7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense - that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
"Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast - in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc. - that we struggle to comprehend it."8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses "greatly marvel</span>
