  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Agency, the power we have to work out our salvation through choosing between good and evil, is the eternal principle that will be the focus of the time I share with you today. Agency is a divine birthright. Bruce R. McConkie encapsulated the doctrinal perspective of agency in these words:

&lt;i&gt;Inherent in the whole system of salvation that grows out of the fall of man; inherent in the great and eternal plan that makes of this life a preparatory and a probationary state; inherent in the very atoning sacrifice of God himself—inherent in the whole eternal plan of salvation is the eternal law of agency. All of the terms and conditions of the Lord’s eternal plan operate because man has his agency, and none of it would have efficacy, virtue, or force if there were no agency. &lt;/i&gt;[Bruce R. McConkie, &lt;i&gt;A New Witness for the Articles of Faith &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 89]

Throughout all dispensations of time, the gift of agency has been given to all of our Heavenly Father’s children with the capacity to think and to reason. Each one of his children has also been given the Light of Christ to guide in the personal exercise of the gift of agency. This is true whether or not the gospel has been on the earth in its fullness.

President David O. McKay reminded us, “Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God’s greatest gift to man” (&lt;i&gt;GI, &lt;/i&gt;p. 299). It is a gift with significant personal responsibility. This responsibility was emphasized by Wilford Woodruff in this statement: “By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do” (Wilford Woodruff, &lt;i&gt;Discourses of Wilford Woodruff &lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 8–9).

We, as spirit children of our Father in Heaven, had the opportunity to choose in the premortal existence because we possessed agency. One of the choices we made was the selection of the plan that was to govern the earth and its people: the plan of Satan &lt;i&gt;without &lt;/i&gt;agency or the plan of Jesus Christ &lt;i&gt;with &lt;/i&gt;agency. We chose the plan with agency—a plan which required that &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;must direct our own lives. The framework for the operation of agency was declared before we made the choice. We knew what we were choosing, and, thereby, we accepted responsibility for the decisions we make and the actions we undertake. Our Heavenly Father holds each of us accountable.

John A. Widtsoe wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Since the law of free agency is ever uppermost in the plan of salvation, the Lord who gave the law must respect it, even though He weep at the errors of His children. It would be a violation of His own plan, should He step in. &lt;/i&gt;[John A. Widtsoe, &lt;i&gt;Evidences and Reconciliations, &lt;/i&gt;arr. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1960, 1987), p. 217]

Our Heavenly Father conforms to the terms and conditions that govern agency and the plan of salvation.

I have a deep testimony that our &lt;i&gt;responsibility &lt;/i&gt;for our agency is as sure as is the &lt;i&gt;gift &lt;/i&gt;of our agency. We cannot change the terms and conditions that govern the principle. We made the decision to accept it, and now we must live by it. It is much like the decision made by those of us who are blessed to be members of the Brigham Young University community, whether we are students, staff, faculty, or administration. When we chose to join this community, if we were and are honest and forthright, we also acknowledged then, and must continue to do so now, that we made the decision to commit ourselves to the Honor Code. We made a covenant in each case—accepting the gift of agency and signing the Honor Code. Our decision was made with terms and conditions established, and it is not our option to demand changes simply because we would prefer to walk or talk or to act in ways that do not conform to the principles, patterns, and practices we knew or should have known before we made the covenants.

President Kimball said:

&lt;i&gt;Every soul must stand trial and pay the uttermost farthing in one way or another. Escape from the consequences of acts of free agency is an impossibility. No one, however clever, bypasses the “due reward of our deeds.” There are dark, deep corners, locked rooms, isolated spots, but no act, good or bad; no thought, ugly or beautiful, ever escapes being seen or heard. Every one will make the imprint on the individual and be recorded, to be met and paid for. Hence, one only deceives himself to think he is “getting by” with anything improper.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;TSWK, &lt;/i&gt;p. 155]

Probably all of you already understand these principles of agency and their significance in our lives, so why have I chosen to discuss this topic? The choice was made because I was impressed that I should share some of the lessons that have been intensified for me through observation, teaching, and working with others; lessons that have provided new insights, deeper understandings, intense joy, and sorrow; lessons that have enriched my life because I accepted the position as director of the Honor Code Office—a position that I did not aspire to and did not seek, but a position that came to me through a quiet, gentle, noncoercive invitation to serve. This is often the way our Heavenly Father presents opportunities and challenges to us. As I pondered the invitation, I came to know that the invitation should be accepted. I, therefore, exercised my agency to respond to what I accepted as a call. This response, over which many of my friends and acquaintances have shaken their heads in disbelief, was a response that has and will affect my life eternally.

Specifically, my experience as director of the Honor Code Office has enhanced my awareness not only of the critical nature of our exercise of agency, but also of the contrasting, sometimes conflicting, conceptions regarding the application of agency in individual lives. The insights that I will share center around three—sometimes distinct and sometimes overlapping—conceptions regarding agency. These are multidimensional conceptions that can be examined from different viewpoints. They are conceptions that I frequently encounter in my work, in the media, and in personal interactions with others.

The first conception has to do with control: &lt;i&gt;Who &lt;/i&gt;is in charge of the terms and conditions under which agency operates? The second conception relates to timing: At what point should sensitivity to the importance of choices and decision become an issue in one’s life? The third conception deals with &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;is one free to choose, to think, and to do? In other words, what aspects of daily life does agency affect or what is the nature of the choices for which one is responsible?

Let’s begin with an examination of some of the differing viewpoints that focus on the conception of &lt;i&gt;control. &lt;/i&gt;One viewpoint suggests that agency, including the terms and conditions upon which it operates, belongs to the individual, and, therefore, the individual is free to take any action or to think any thoughts so long as they are chosen and the choices feel okay to the individual making the decisions. Individuals of this persuasion respond warmly to the doctrine of Korihor that “every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and . . . every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime” (Alma 30:17). They also like Nehor’s message “that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear” (Alma 1:4). Thus, everyone is &lt;i&gt;okay &lt;/i&gt;just as they are and will be saved in the kingdom—if there is a kingdom—so not to worry.

These individuals tend to see man, especially themselves, as having great wisdom and sometimes suggest that surely this is the basis upon which man was given agency in the first place. Therefore, whatever thoughts are espoused and whatever actions are embraced are fine because they have been chosen.

The kinds of messages that have accompanied the expression of this viewpoint regarding control in the exercise of agency include “I am the boss of what, when, where, and how I will do things. After all, through the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith I have come to know that I am to be taught correct principles and then allowed to govern myself. Don’t you understand that I am free to do whatever I choose?” Somehow the anticipation, as these words are expressed, is that the consummation of such choices, having been freely made, assures one that there are no consequences emanating from them. Curiously, these thoughts are often articulated when it is evident that the principles are probably not understood. In addition, the personal certainty of those who champion this viewpoint regarding control of the exercise of agency ensures that they are unlikely to see or will not see or accept the messages before them. Self-justification becomes seductive, and rationalization alluring and provocative.

A contrasting viewpoint related to the conception of control in the exercise of agency is based on the perception that personal responsibility must be assumed because a covenant was made when the gift was accepted. Individuals who embrace this conviction understand their responsibility for exercising their agency and are sensitive about the need to make changes and adjustments in their lives. These individuals echo Nephi’s words, “Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite!” (2 Nephi 4:31–32). Their appreciation of the gift of agency is deep, and they understand its relationship to repentance. This level of commitment is expressed in words such as “I am grateful for the lessons I have learned from the errors I have made because they have given me insight about repentance—an insight that has been followed by my application of the principle. The process has not been easy. In fact, it has been very exacting, but I know, as never before, that the Savior loves me and that he trusts me to grow through experience and by the exercise of my agency.”

The second agency-related conception, &lt;i&gt;timing, &lt;/i&gt;is an issue that we each encounter frequently in our own and in the lives of others. Basically, disparate viewpoints center on &lt;i&gt;when &lt;/i&gt;an individual thinks they ought to get serious about the choices and decisions that are made.

Some of the expressed viewpoints about timing as they affect agency include “Anything I do is okay until I am baptized” or “Having entered the kingdom through baptism, the Atonement takes care of all sins—so everything is splendid. What’s the big deal? Why push me now?”

Or you may have heard, as I have, “When I am ready, I will take care of &lt;i&gt;it &lt;/i&gt;(whatever their &lt;i&gt;it &lt;/i&gt;is), so please just leave me alone. Don’t bug me. The Atonement has made amends for sin already. The Savior understands me. He knows my weaknesses, and his help will be available to me when I am ready. I just need to repent, and I will do it when I am ready and not a minute sooner.” I find the arrogance of this position heartbreaking—heartbreaking for the individual making the statement as well as heartbreaking for me. There is no sense of the depth of pain and anguish that was experienced in Gethsemane, no sense of the agony that accompanied the Savior’s willing sacrifice, no sense of awareness that we each personally contributed to that agony, no expression of humility or gratitude that our Elder Brother cared so much that he gave his all for each of us—a sacrifice that only he could make.

The thought that some could say to themselves, let alone to others, “I will do as I please and then accept the offering when it is expedient for me” is almost inconceivable.

Another viewpoint related to the conception of timing is that expressed by those who do not desire, who sometimes even refuse, to make decisions now or in the foreseeable future. These are they who become so consumed by the responsibility to righteously exercise their agency that they fear doing anything. They are like the recipient of the “one talent” who hid it in the ground so it would not be lost. They ask, “Is it okay if I . . . ?” or “What should I do?” or “Why won’t you just tell me what to do?” They want direction in all things at all times. Responsibility is too much for them.

Then there are those whose viewpoint of the exercise of agency encompasses both the &lt;i&gt;costs &lt;/i&gt;embodied in the Atonement and the personal responsibility that comes with having accepted the gift. These individuals often acknowledge that they regret the mistakes, miscalculations, misinterpretations, and misconceptions that have led to sin in their lives. However, their experiences have also taught them to follow the counsel given by Alma to his son Corianton: “Let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance” (Alma 42:29). They become more sensitive to the early warning signs of things that might cause them to stray into strange byways, and they relish the lessons that prompt them to cling more tightly to the iron rod and stay on the straight and narrow path.

Viewpoints related to “who has control of the terms and conditions that give us the framework for exercise of agency” and related to “the point at which one ought to become concerned about one’s choices and decisions” often interface with the third conception: &lt;i&gt;Free to do what? &lt;/i&gt;Viewpoints about “free to do what?” frequently produce a dichotomy. Choices are seen as (1) those things that one ought not to do and (2) those things that one ought to do. Sometimes the ought-to-dos are also seen as things that one ought to do but would rather not do.

Some hold that agency is only exercised when one is approaching or is on the doorstep of imprudence, impropriety, immorality, or some other thought or action cleverly presented by Satan. For those thus engaged, movement from the path of righteousness is usually an easy step-by-step process—here a little, there a little. Movement toward wrongdoing unfolds over time and seldom is a sudden leap into major misdeeds.

Contrary to the position of those who hold the view that agency is only exercised when choosing to do what one ought not to do, the exercise of agency is not unidirectional. President Brigham Young taught:

&lt;i&gt;Does it follow that a man is deprived of his rights, because he lists in his heart to do the will of God? &lt;/i&gt;. . . &lt;i&gt;I can manifest to the heavens and to the inhabitants of the earth that I am freeborn, and have my liberty before God, angels and men, when I kneel down to pray, certainly as much as if I were to go out and swear. &lt;/i&gt;. . . &lt;i&gt;I believe that this course proves that I am a free agent, as much as if I were to steal, swear, lie, and get drunk.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;DBY, &lt;/i&gt;p. 65]

Agency is ours. Choices and decisions are ours. We are responsible for them. Let us, therefore, choose wisely. In the time that remains, let us look together at some of the fundamental options that continually require our exercise of agency.

May we willingly choose &lt;i&gt;obedience over disobedience &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;compliance over resistance! &lt;/i&gt;Obedience requires, in the words of Elder McConkie, that “we voluntarily choose good rather than evil, light in preference to darkness, Deity’s way in preference to the devil’s, [otherwise] it is philosophically impossible to be saved” (McConkie, &lt;i&gt;A New Witness, &lt;/i&gt;p. 683).

Having signed the Honor Code, thus covenanting to abide by it, a student may ask, “What difference does it make if my appearance doesn’t meet the Dress and Grooming Standards? After all, it’s what’s inside that counts. You do not know the real me, and if you’d relax and get to know me, you’d realize that I am okay, that I do have good and appropriate intentions.” However, deliberate disregard of the Dress and Grooming Standards is a visible sign of disobedience, and it does indeed speak to what’s inside, but the message likely differs from what the individual perceives. The arguments used to cover the choice to do other than complying with the commitment that has been made are irrelevant.

Another example of deliberate behaviors that reflect disobedience and that frequently comes to the attention of the Honor Code Office has to do with the Residential Living Standards. Parenthetically, we are apprehensive that an increase in such reports may be experienced because teenage, coed slumber parties are in vogue in the world, and, in fact, are the hot topic on talk shows this week. Sometimes as Latter-day Saints we follow the world’s patterns rather than firmly establishing and maintaining our own.

There are individuals who declare that those who support the Residential Living Standards—expecting that young men and young women not go into each other’s private living spaces (bedrooms and bathrooms as opposed to public areas like living rooms and kitchens)—are residing in the Dark Ages and need to get up to the decade of the nineties. A letter from a former student reflects the folly of attempting to explain away Residential Living Standards. The letter read, “I thought that the rules regarding Residential Living Standards were the most ridiculous rules that ever existed. After all, I reasoned, you should have been able to discern that nothing inappropriate was either intended or going on. After all, we only went into the bedroom to study together, to read the scriptures, and to pray. I am sorry to have to report that I came to know that the rules were not ridiculous. They were to protect us, and they were founded on principles. The reasons are clear to me now, and I want to apologize for my disregard of them. Should my children ever have the privilege of becoming students at BYU, rest assured that they will be instructed by their parents before they leave home that Residential Living Standards matter.”

Other approaches to rationalizing misbehavior—&lt;i&gt;choosing disobedience over obedience—&lt;/i&gt;are reflected in such conversations as “Yes, I do know what is right and what I ought to do, but I was helping a friend” or “I need to know what it is like so that I can understand what my brother or sister who has a problem is going through. Besides, I know my strengths. I am sufficiently strong that I will not be bothered by the experience, and I will not go too far.” Or a more succinct statement of some, “The Devil made me do it,” which when translated means “It was all my roommate’s fault. If she or he had not introduced the idea, nothing would have happened.” Little do they recognize that the devil or a roommate only has power to “make us do it” if we give permission, which we may have been doing one small piece at a time until we have become hard in our hearts and blind in our minds (see 3 Nephi 2:1).

Another set of choices has to do with &lt;i&gt;selecting integrity over duplicity &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;virtue over vice. &lt;/i&gt;Our word should be as good as our bond. President Kimball taught that “one might be full of wit and humor; one might be dexterous in performance, but if he has not honor and integrity, he has little or nothing” (&lt;i&gt;TSWK, &lt;/i&gt;p. 388). We must decide our direction. We must determine who it is that we would like to become. As President Benson said:

&lt;i&gt;Most individuals do not intend to be dishonest, dishonorable, or immoral. They seem to allow their characters to erode by a series of rationalizations, lies, and compromises. Then when grave temptation presents itself, they haven’t the strength of character to do what they know to be right. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;TETB, &lt;/i&gt;p. 367]

Cheating, defrauding, flattering, and deceiving do not establish a basis of trust for family life, friendship, or career. The student who, in the midst of egregious violation of Church standards and Honor Code expectations, tells himself, “Don’t think about being a BYU student, a temple-attending returned missionary who is employed by the Church, because if you do you will not be able to savor this moment, you will have to stop what you are now doing,” is absorbed in deeply deceptive behavior that cheats and defrauds self more than others. A total lack of sensitivity to the absence of personal integrity and the integrity of the institutions affected by the action seems clear.

On the other hand, a student who has violated Church and Honor Code standards, who accepts responsibility for what has been done, who is remorseful, who confesses the violation, and who takes every step within the range of possibility to make amends, now says, “I wish that every student could have experienced what I have experienced because the experience has blessed my life. We all take the gospel, our membership in the Church, our student status, and the Honor Code too lightly. But it is better to not have to learn this the hard way. I will do everything in my power to help others avoid doing what I have done.” This student has vigorously affirmed the desire to make integrity a central feature of daily living.

We ought also to consider the personal strength that ensues from &lt;i&gt;choosing righteous limits over license, leeway, and laxity. &lt;/i&gt;In fact, we ought to give consideration to going beyond basic obedience to creating and setting limits for ourselves that enhance our reach for salvation. The limits we personally set should go beyond what we think is required. They should be limits that enhance our commitment and conformity to eternal truths. The outcome of reaching beyond the mark may be a fundamental pattern that relates to the high expectations for those who are part of the Brigham Young University family—expectations that in some specific dimensions are higher than those for Church members in general; expectations that, if met, will prepare us more fully for responsibility in the kingdom; expectations that are an assurance that the education and discipline of the spirit are critical dimensions of a BYU education.

The counsel to extend ourselves beyond basic duty came as the Savior responded to the apostles, as recorded in Luke, when they desired to know what they could do to increase their faith. Jesus said:

&lt;i&gt;When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. &lt;/i&gt;[Luke 17:10]

Related to setting limits is the discipline that comes from &lt;i&gt;choosing industry over misdirected industry, idleness, and sloth. &lt;/i&gt;The Book of Mormon is replete with examples of the results of industry and developing talents and the consequences of idleness, which is consistently followed by the appearance of depravity.

Daily we are presented with opportunities to make the effort to accomplish what is needful or to try to cover our deficiency by deception. Explanations we hear regarding the justification for academic dishonesty are frequently linked to lack of or misdirection of industry. Frequently, for example, it seems that attention to friends, leisure, personal interests, and addictions to television programs or computer games are more critical than studies and require so much time that there is no time left for preparation. We hear, “I am exhausted because we never get to bed before two or three in the morning. I don’t have the energy or time to go to class and to study. I have to have my sleep or I will get sick.” Perhaps they &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;in a sense experiencing a sickness—but one that is not evident to them—and surely this is one of a different nature than a sickness resulting from a lack of sleep.

I will ever be grateful for parents who not only assisted each of their children in the development of useful skills and talents but also provided us with the opportunity to experience the rewards and satisfaction of working hard and sharing the process with others.

Another test with which we are faced is the &lt;i&gt;choice of selflessness over selfishness. &lt;/i&gt;These are choices that are central to our eternal salvation because they encompass the rendering of service. Sometimes we see selfishness as only connected to material things. The more acute test between selflessness and selfishness, however, is reflected in demands for self-gratification. Contrast, for example, those who see only their own desires to exert power over another or see only satisfaction of their own physical needs as a primary goal with those who are sensitive to others’ needs and are willing to extend themselves to meet the needs. Those who see others’ needs may at times see the needs more clearly than the individuals who have the needs.

Another significant set of choices for which we will be accountable grows out of repeated counsel from the prophets regarding the establishment of homes. The implications of choosing home over &lt;i&gt;whatever else catches our fancy &lt;/i&gt;are touched on in some way in every general conference. President Joseph F. Smith indicated, for example:

&lt;i&gt;There is no substitute for the home. Its foundation is as ancient as the world, and its mission has been ordained of God from the earliest of times. From Abraham sprang two ancient races represented in Isaac and Ishmael. The one built stable homes, and prized its land as a divine inheritance. The other became children of the desert, and as restless as its ever-shifting sands upon which their tents were pitched. . . . The home then is more than a habitation, it is an institution which stands for stability and love in individuals as well as in nations. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;GD, &lt;/i&gt;p. 300]

As you make choices, give attention to the possibility that many of us may not be living in homes today but rather in houses, condominiums, or apartments. These may be mere spaces that provide no more than “wandering grounds” for a nomadic family system; spaces that only provide a place to graze and occasionally to rest; spaces where people come and go at their own paces and leisure without reference to others; spaces where family work that creates ties that bind has been eliminated to the greatest extent possible. The elimination of family work has also limited the opportunity to learn about integrity through contributing to and receiving from others. Shared work and shared responsibility produce an awareness of the consequences of the exercise of agency.

Living spaces as opposed to homes have the potential of creating a modern-day nomadic culture with weak roots. The counsel of the prophets that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home” (David O. McKay, &lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;April 1964, p. 5) and “Remember always that the most important of the Lord’s work you and I will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes” (Harold B. Lee, &lt;i&gt;Stand Ye in Holy Places &lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1975], pp. 255–56) should receive primary attention in our exercise of agency. The distractions to home are many and colorfully presented. The decisions that must be made related to home and family are far too critical to be left to whatever time is left over. Exercise of our agency should assure that home as it encompasses family will be a top priority, requiring commitment of our most serious thought and consistent effort.

In conclusion, a student told me recently, “I have come to know that my exercise of agency has influence that extends beyond myself. I have become aware of ways in which my choices and my interactions affect others—ways that I would never have dreamed would make a difference.” The student echoed President McKay’s instruction that

&lt;i&gt;there is another responsibility correlated and even coexistent with free agency, which is too infrequently emphasized, and that is the effect not only of a person’s actions but also of his thoughts upon others. Man radiates what he is, and that radiation affects to a greater or lesser degree every person who comes within that radiation.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;GI, &lt;/i&gt;p. 302; &lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;April 1950, p. 34]

Please recognize that our influence can be quiet and subtle. We may be unaware that the choices we make—the things we do and say—are even noted by those around us. Still, we are responsible, whether we deliberately set about to influence others or whether it happens without our forethought or our awareness. Our agency is reflected in the hundreds of small decisions made each day—the choices made in each interaction, whatever the context, influence in small or significant ways. The power of the subtle exercise of agency on you personally, or on others, might be seen by taking a short walk here on campus. Go down the sidewalk on the west side of the McKay Building past the Brimhall Building toward the Maeser Building and look carefully at the sidewalk—you will discover some sections where it appears that soon after the cement was poured leaves dropped from the trees onto the wet surface. Now the weight of a leaf is not great, but it was sufficient at that point to leave an impression in the concrete for all to see. The influence of your choices need not be ponderous or be widely advertised. The gentle impressions—whether the warmth and assurance that come through choices that lead to salvation or those that quietly dissuade from paths of righteousness—carry the message. Just as the leaves left their impression long after the leaves were no more, your choices will influence even after you are no more.

May we each be blessed with a deeper appreciation of the significance of our gift of agency: a gift with responsibility, a gift that is the foundation of our soul’s progress toward salvation. May we know that our daily exercise of agency has eternal reverberations. May we understand that we have both control and responsibility within the terms and conditions of the gift we have been given. May we know that &lt;i&gt;now is the time &lt;/i&gt;to take seriously and give attention to the choices we make. May we know by the witness of the Spirit that the greatest reflection of the exercise of our agency is found when—against all odds, against all pressure, persuasion, and enticement—we still choose the right. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Agency, the power we have to work out our salvation through choosing between good and evil, is the eternal principle that will be the focus of the time I share with you today. Agency is a divine birthright. Bruce R. McConkie encapsulated the doctrinal perspective of agency in these words:</p>
<p><i>Inherent in the whole system of salvation that grows out of the fall of man; inherent in the great and eternal plan that makes of this life a preparatory and a probationary state; inherent in the very atoning sacrifice of God himself—inherent in the whole eternal plan of salvation is the eternal law of agency. All of the terms and conditions of the Lord’s eternal plan operate because man has his agency, and none of it would have efficacy, virtue, or force if there were no agency. </i>[Bruce R. McConkie, <i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith </i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 89]</p>
<p>Throughout all dispensations of time, the gift of agency has been given to all of our Heavenly Father’s children with the capacity to think and to reason. Each one of his children has also been given the Light of Christ to guide in the personal exercise of the gift of agency. This is true whether or not the gospel has been on the earth in its fullness.</p>
<p>President David O. McKay reminded us, “Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God’s greatest gift to man” (<i>GI, </i>p. 299). It is a gift with significant personal responsibility. This responsibility was emphasized by Wilford Woodruff in this statement: “By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do” (Wilford Woodruff, <i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff </i>[Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 8–9).</p>
<p>We, as spirit children of our Father in Heaven, had the opportunity to choose in the premortal existence because we possessed agency. One of the choices we made was the selection of the plan that was to govern the earth and its people: the plan of Satan <i>without </i>agency or the plan of Jesus Christ <i>with </i>agency. We chose the plan with agency—a plan which required that <i>we </i>must direct our own lives. The framework for the operation of agency was declared before we made the choice. We knew what we were choosing, and, thereby, we accepted responsibility for the decisions we make and the actions we undertake. Our Heavenly Father holds each of us accountable.</p>
<p>John A. Widtsoe wrote:</p>
<p><i>Since the law of free agency is ever uppermost in the plan of salvation, the Lord who gave the law must respect it, even though He weep at the errors of His children. It would be a violation of His own plan, should He step in. </i>[John A. Widtsoe, <i>Evidences and Reconciliations, </i>arr. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1960, 1987), p. 217]</p>
<p>Our Heavenly Father conforms to the terms and conditions that govern agency and the plan of salvation.</p>
<p>I have a deep testimony that our <i>responsibility </i>for our agency is as sure as is the <i>gift </i>of our agency. We cannot change the terms and conditions that govern the principle. We made the decision to accept it, and now we must live by it. It is much like the decision made by those of us who are blessed to be members of the Brigham Young University community, whether we are students, staff, faculty, or administration. When we chose to join this community, if we were and are honest and forthright, we also acknowledged then, and must continue to do so now, that we made the decision to commit ourselves to the Honor Code. We made a covenant in each case—accepting the gift of agency and signing the Honor Code. Our decision was made with terms and conditions established, and it is not our option to demand changes simply because we would prefer to walk or talk or to act in ways that do not conform to the principles, patterns, and practices we knew or should have known before we made the covenants.</p>
<p>President Kimball said:</p>
<p><i>Every soul must stand trial and pay the uttermost farthing in one way or another. Escape from the consequences of acts of free agency is an impossibility. No one, however clever, bypasses the “due reward of our deeds.” There are dark, deep corners, locked rooms, isolated spots, but no act, good or bad; no thought, ugly or beautiful, ever escapes being seen or heard. Every one will make the imprint on the individual and be recorded, to be met and paid for. Hence, one only deceives himself to think he is “getting by” with anything improper.</i> [<i>TSWK, </i>p. 155]</p>
<p>Probably all of you already understand these principles of agency and their significance in our lives, so why have I chosen to discuss this topic? The choice was made because I was impressed that I should share some of the lessons that have been intensified for me through observation, teaching, and working with others; lessons that have provided new insights, deeper understandings, intense joy, and sorrow; lessons that have enriched my life because I accepted the position as director of the Honor Code Office—a position that I did not aspire to and did not seek, but a position that came to me through a quiet, gentle, noncoercive invitation to serve. This is often the way our Heavenly Father presents opportunities and challenges to us. As I pondered the invitation, I came to know that the invitation should be accepted. I, therefore, exercised my agency to respond to what I accepted as a call. This response, over which many of my friends and acquaintances have shaken their heads in disbelief, was a response that has and will affect my life eternally.</p>
<p>Specifically, my experience as director of the Honor Code Office has enhanced my awareness not only of the critical nature of our exercise of agency, but also of the contrasting, sometimes conflicting, conceptions regarding the application of agency in individual lives. The insights that I will share center around three—sometimes distinct and sometimes overlapping—conceptions regarding agency. These are multidimensional conceptions that can be examined from different viewpoints. They are conceptions that I frequently encounter in my work, in the media, and in personal interactions with others.</p>
<p>The first conception has to do with control: <i>Who </i>is in charge of the terms and conditions under which agency operates? The second conception relates to timing: At what point should sensitivity to the importance of choices and decision become an issue in one’s life? The third conception deals with <i>what </i>is one free to choose, to think, and to do? In other words, what aspects of daily life does agency affect or what is the nature of the choices for which one is responsible?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with an examination of some of the differing viewpoints that focus on the conception of <i>control. </i>One viewpoint suggests that agency, including the terms and conditions upon which it operates, belongs to the individual, and, therefore, the individual is free to take any action or to think any thoughts so long as they are chosen and the choices feel okay to the individual making the decisions. Individuals of this persuasion respond warmly to the doctrine of Korihor that “every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and . . . every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime” (Alma 30:17). They also like Nehor’s message “that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear” (Alma 1:4). Thus, everyone is <i>okay </i>just as they are and will be saved in the kingdom—if there is a kingdom—so not to worry.</p>
<p>These individuals tend to see man, especially themselves, as having great wisdom and sometimes suggest that surely this is the basis upon which man was given agency in the first place. Therefore, whatever thoughts are espoused and whatever actions are embraced are fine because they have been chosen.</p>
<p>The kinds of messages that have accompanied the expression of this viewpoint regarding control in the exercise of agency include “I am the boss of what, when, where, and how I will do things. After all, through the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith I have come to know that I am to be taught correct principles and then allowed to govern myself. Don’t you understand that I am free to do whatever I choose?” Somehow the anticipation, as these words are expressed, is that the consummation of such choices, having been freely made, assures one that there are no consequences emanating from them. Curiously, these thoughts are often articulated when it is evident that the principles are probably not understood. In addition, the personal certainty of those who champion this viewpoint regarding control of the exercise of agency ensures that they are unlikely to see or will not see or accept the messages before them. Self-justification becomes seductive, and rationalization alluring and provocative.</p>
<p>A contrasting viewpoint related to the conception of control in the exercise of agency is based on the perception that personal responsibility must be assumed because a covenant was made when the gift was accepted. Individuals who embrace this conviction understand their responsibility for exercising their agency and are sensitive about the need to make changes and adjustments in their lives. These individuals echo Nephi’s words, “Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite!” (2 Nephi 4:31–32). Their appreciation of the gift of agency is deep, and they understand its relationship to repentance. This level of commitment is expressed in words such as “I am grateful for the lessons I have learned from the errors I have made because they have given me insight about repentance—an insight that has been followed by my application of the principle. The process has not been easy. In fact, it has been very exacting, but I know, as never before, that the Savior loves me and that he trusts me to grow through experience and by the exercise of my agency.”</p>
<p>The second agency-related conception, <i>timing, </i>is an issue that we each encounter frequently in our own and in the lives of others. Basically, disparate viewpoints center on <i>when </i>an individual thinks they ought to get serious about the choices and decisions that are made.</p>
<p>Some of the expressed viewpoints about timing as they affect agency include “Anything I do is okay until I am baptized” or “Having entered the kingdom through baptism, the Atonement takes care of all sins—so everything is splendid. What’s the big deal? Why push me now?”</p>
<p>Or you may have heard, as I have, “When I am ready, I will take care of <i>it </i>(whatever their <i>it </i>is), so please just leave me alone. Don’t bug me. The Atonement has made amends for sin already. The Savior understands me. He knows my weaknesses, and his help will be available to me when I am ready. I just need to repent, and I will do it when I am ready and not a minute sooner.” I find the arrogance of this position heartbreaking—heartbreaking for the individual making the statement as well as heartbreaking for me. There is no sense of the depth of pain and anguish that was experienced in Gethsemane, no sense of the agony that accompanied the Savior’s willing sacrifice, no sense of awareness that we each personally contributed to that agony, no expression of humility or gratitude that our Elder Brother cared so much that he gave his all for each of us—a sacrifice that only he could make.</p>
<p>The thought that some could say to themselves, let alone to others, “I will do as I please and then accept the offering when it is expedient for me” is almost inconceivable.</p>
<p>Another viewpoint related to the conception of timing is that expressed by those who do not desire, who sometimes even refuse, to make decisions now or in the foreseeable future. These are they who become so consumed by the responsibility to righteously exercise their agency that they fear doing anything. They are like the recipient of the “one talent” who hid it in the ground so it would not be lost. They ask, “Is it okay if I . . . ?” or “What should I do?” or “Why won’t you just tell me what to do?” They want direction in all things at all times. Responsibility is too much for them.</p>
<p>Then there are those whose viewpoint of the exercise of agency encompasses both the <i>costs </i>embodied in the Atonement and the personal responsibility that comes with having accepted the gift. These individuals often acknowledge that they regret the mistakes, miscalculations, misinterpretations, and misconceptions that have led to sin in their lives. However, their experiences have also taught them to follow the counsel given by Alma to his son Corianton: “Let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance” (Alma 42:29). They become more sensitive to the early warning signs of things that might cause them to stray into strange byways, and they relish the lessons that prompt them to cling more tightly to the iron rod and stay on the straight and narrow path.</p>
<p>Viewpoints related to “who has control of the terms and conditions that give us the framework for exercise of agency” and related to “the point at which one ought to become concerned about one’s choices and decisions” often interface with the third conception: <i>Free to do what? </i>Viewpoints about “free to do what?” frequently produce a dichotomy. Choices are seen as (1) those things that one ought not to do and (2) those things that one ought to do. Sometimes the ought-to-dos are also seen as things that one ought to do but would rather not do.</p>
<p>Some hold that agency is only exercised when one is approaching or is on the doorstep of imprudence, impropriety, immorality, or some other thought or action cleverly presented by Satan. For those thus engaged, movement from the path of righteousness is usually an easy step-by-step process—here a little, there a little. Movement toward wrongdoing unfolds over time and seldom is a sudden leap into major misdeeds.</p>
<p>Contrary to the position of those who hold the view that agency is only exercised when choosing to do what one ought not to do, the exercise of agency is not unidirectional. President Brigham Young taught:</p>
<p><i>Does it follow that a man is deprived of his rights, because he lists in his heart to do the will of God? </i>. . . <i>I can manifest to the heavens and to the inhabitants of the earth that I am freeborn, and have my liberty before God, angels and men, when I kneel down to pray, certainly as much as if I were to go out and swear. </i>. . . <i>I believe that this course proves that I am a free agent, as much as if I were to steal, swear, lie, and get drunk.</i> [<i>DBY, </i>p. 65]</p>
<p>Agency is ours. Choices and decisions are ours. We are responsible for them. Let us, therefore, choose wisely. In the time that remains, let us look together at some of the fundamental options that continually require our exercise of agency.</p>
<p>May we willingly choose <i>obedience over disobedience </i>and <i>compliance over resistance! </i>Obedience requires, in the words of Elder McConkie, that “we voluntarily choose good rather than evil, light in preference to darkness, Deity’s way in preference to the devil’s, [otherwise] it is philosophically impossible to be saved” (McConkie, <i>A New Witness, </i>p. 683).</p>
<p>Having signed the Honor Code, thus covenanting to abide by it, a student may ask, “What difference does it make if my appearance doesn’t meet the Dress and Grooming Standards? After all, it’s what’s inside that counts. You do not know the real me, and if you’d relax and get to know me, you’d realize that I am okay, that I do have good and appropriate intentions.” However, deliberate disregard of the Dress and Grooming Standards is a visible sign of disobedience, and it does indeed speak to what’s inside, but the message likely differs from what the individual perceives. The arguments used to cover the choice to do other than complying with the commitment that has been made are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Another example of deliberate behaviors that reflect disobedience and that frequently comes to the attention of the Honor Code Office has to do with the Residential Living Standards. Parenthetically, we are apprehensive that an increase in such reports may be experienced because teenage, coed slumber parties are in vogue in the world, and, in fact, are the hot topic on talk shows this week. Sometimes as Latter-day Saints we follow the world’s patterns rather than firmly establishing and maintaining our own.</p>
<p>There are individuals who declare that those who support the Residential Living Standards—expecting that young men and young women not go into each other’s private living spaces (bedrooms and bathrooms as opposed to public areas like living rooms and kitchens)—are residing in the Dark Ages and need to get up to the decade of the nineties. A letter from a former student reflects the folly of attempting to explain away Residential Living Standards. The letter read, “I thought that the rules regarding Residential Living Standards were the most ridiculous rules that ever existed. After all, I reasoned, you should have been able to discern that nothing inappropriate was either intended or going on. After all, we only went into the bedroom to study together, to read the scriptures, and to pray. I am sorry to have to report that I came to know that the rules were not ridiculous. They were to protect us, and they were founded on principles. The reasons are clear to me now, and I want to apologize for my disregard of them. Should my children ever have the privilege of becoming students at BYU, rest assured that they will be instructed by their parents before they leave home that Residential Living Standards matter.”</p>
<p>Other approaches to rationalizing misbehavior—<i>choosing disobedience over obedience—</i>are reflected in such conversations as “Yes, I do know what is right and what I ought to do, but I was helping a friend” or “I need to know what it is like so that I can understand what my brother or sister who has a problem is going through. Besides, I know my strengths. I am sufficiently strong that I will not be bothered by the experience, and I will not go too far.” Or a more succinct statement of some, “The Devil made me do it,” which when translated means “It was all my roommate’s fault. If she or he had not introduced the idea, nothing would have happened.” Little do they recognize that the devil or a roommate only has power to “make us do it” if we give permission, which we may have been doing one small piece at a time until we have become hard in our hearts and blind in our minds (see 3 Nephi 2:1).</p>
<p>Another set of choices has to do with <i>selecting integrity over duplicity </i>and <i>virtue over vice. </i>Our word should be as good as our bond. President Kimball taught that “one might be full of wit and humor; one might be dexterous in performance, but if he has not honor and integrity, he has little or nothing” (<i>TSWK, </i>p. 388). We must decide our direction. We must determine who it is that we would like to become. As President Benson said:</p>
<p><i>Most individuals do not intend to be dishonest, dishonorable, or immoral. They seem to allow their characters to erode by a series of rationalizations, lies, and compromises. Then when grave temptation presents itself, they haven’t the strength of character to do what they know to be right. </i>[<i>TETB, </i>p. 367]</p>
<p>Cheating, defrauding, flattering, and deceiving do not establish a basis of trust for family life, friendship, or career. The student who, in the midst of egregious violation of Church standards and Honor Code expectations, tells himself, “Don’t think about being a BYU student, a temple-attending returned missionary who is employed by the Church, because if you do you will not be able to savor this moment, you will have to stop what you are now doing,” is absorbed in deeply deceptive behavior that cheats and defrauds self more than others. A total lack of sensitivity to the absence of personal integrity and the integrity of the institutions affected by the action seems clear.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a student who has violated Church and Honor Code standards, who accepts responsibility for what has been done, who is remorseful, who confesses the violation, and who takes every step within the range of possibility to make amends, now says, “I wish that every student could have experienced what I have experienced because the experience has blessed my life. We all take the gospel, our membership in the Church, our student status, and the Honor Code too lightly. But it is better to not have to learn this the hard way. I will do everything in my power to help others avoid doing what I have done.” This student has vigorously affirmed the desire to make integrity a central feature of daily living.</p>
<p>We ought also to consider the personal strength that ensues from <i>choosing righteous limits over license, leeway, and laxity. </i>In fact, we ought to give consideration to going beyond basic obedience to creating and setting limits for ourselves that enhance our reach for salvation. The limits we personally set should go beyond what we think is required. They should be limits that enhance our commitment and conformity to eternal truths. The outcome of reaching beyond the mark may be a fundamental pattern that relates to the high expectations for those who are part of the Brigham Young University family—expectations that in some specific dimensions are higher than those for Church members in general; expectations that, if met, will prepare us more fully for responsibility in the kingdom; expectations that are an assurance that the education and discipline of the spirit are critical dimensions of a BYU education.</p>
<p>The counsel to extend ourselves beyond basic duty came as the Savior responded to the apostles, as recorded in Luke, when they desired to know what they could do to increase their faith. Jesus said:</p>
<p><i>When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. </i>[Luke 17:10]</p>
<p>Related to setting limits is the discipline that comes from <i>choosing industry over misdirected industry, idleness, and sloth. </i>The Book of Mormon is replete with examples of the results of industry and developing talents and the consequences of idleness, which is consistently followed by the appearance of depravity.</p>
<p>Daily we are presented with opportunities to make the effort to accomplish what is needful or to try to cover our deficiency by deception. Explanations we hear regarding the justification for academic dishonesty are frequently linked to lack of or misdirection of industry. Frequently, for example, it seems that attention to friends, leisure, personal interests, and addictions to television programs or computer games are more critical than studies and require so much time that there is no time left for preparation. We hear, “I am exhausted because we never get to bed before two or three in the morning. I don’t have the energy or time to go to class and to study. I have to have my sleep or I will get sick.” Perhaps they <i>are </i>in a sense experiencing a sickness—but one that is not evident to them—and surely this is one of a different nature than a sickness resulting from a lack of sleep.</p>
<p>I will ever be grateful for parents who not only assisted each of their children in the development of useful skills and talents but also provided us with the opportunity to experience the rewards and satisfaction of working hard and sharing the process with others.</p>
<p>Another test with which we are faced is the <i>choice of selflessness over selfishness. </i>These are choices that are central to our eternal salvation because they encompass the rendering of service. Sometimes we see selfishness as only connected to material things. The more acute test between selflessness and selfishness, however, is reflected in demands for self-gratification. Contrast, for example, those who see only their own desires to exert power over another or see only satisfaction of their own physical needs as a primary goal with those who are sensitive to others’ needs and are willing to extend themselves to meet the needs. Those who see others’ needs may at times see the needs more clearly than the individuals who have the needs.</p>
<p>Another significant set of choices for which we will be accountable grows out of repeated counsel from the prophets regarding the establishment of homes. The implications of choosing home over <i>whatever else catches our fancy </i>are touched on in some way in every general conference. President Joseph F. Smith indicated, for example:</p>
<p><i>There is no substitute for the home. Its foundation is as ancient as the world, and its mission has been ordained of God from the earliest of times. From Abraham sprang two ancient races represented in Isaac and Ishmael. The one built stable homes, and prized its land as a divine inheritance. The other became children of the desert, and as restless as its ever-shifting sands upon which their tents were pitched. . . . The home then is more than a habitation, it is an institution which stands for stability and love in individuals as well as in nations. </i>[<i>GD, </i>p. 300]</p>
<p>As you make choices, give attention to the possibility that many of us may not be living in homes today but rather in houses, condominiums, or apartments. These may be mere spaces that provide no more than “wandering grounds” for a nomadic family system; spaces that only provide a place to graze and occasionally to rest; spaces where people come and go at their own paces and leisure without reference to others; spaces where family work that creates ties that bind has been eliminated to the greatest extent possible. The elimination of family work has also limited the opportunity to learn about integrity through contributing to and receiving from others. Shared work and shared responsibility produce an awareness of the consequences of the exercise of agency.</p>
<p>Living spaces as opposed to homes have the potential of creating a modern-day nomadic culture with weak roots. The counsel of the prophets that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home” (David O. McKay, <i>CR, </i>April 1964, p. 5) and “Remember always that the most important of the Lord’s work you and I will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes” (Harold B. Lee, <i>Stand Ye in Holy Places </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1975], pp. 255–56) should receive primary attention in our exercise of agency. The distractions to home are many and colorfully presented. The decisions that must be made related to home and family are far too critical to be left to whatever time is left over. Exercise of our agency should assure that home as it encompasses family will be a top priority, requiring commitment of our most serious thought and consistent effort.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a student told me recently, “I have come to know that my exercise of agency has influence that extends beyond myself. I have become aware of ways in which my choices and my interactions affect others—ways that I would never have dreamed would make a difference.” The student echoed President McKay’s instruction that</p>
<p><i>there is another responsibility correlated and even coexistent with free agency, which is too infrequently emphasized, and that is the effect not only of a person’s actions but also of his thoughts upon others. Man radiates what he is, and that radiation affects to a greater or lesser degree every person who comes within that radiation.</i> [<i>GI, </i>p. 302; <i>CR, </i>April 1950, p. 34]</p>
<p>Please recognize that our influence can be quiet and subtle. We may be unaware that the choices we make—the things we do and say—are even noted by those around us. Still, we are responsible, whether we deliberately set about to influence others or whether it happens without our forethought or our awareness. Our agency is reflected in the hundreds of small decisions made each day—the choices made in each interaction, whatever the context, influence in small or significant ways. The power of the subtle exercise of agency on you personally, or on others, might be seen by taking a short walk here on campus. Go down the sidewalk on the west side of the McKay Building past the Brimhall Building toward the Maeser Building and look carefully at the sidewalk—you will discover some sections where it appears that soon after the cement was poured leaves dropped from the trees onto the wet surface. Now the weight of a leaf is not great, but it was sufficient at that point to leave an impression in the concrete for all to see. The influence of your choices need not be ponderous or be widely advertised. The gentle impressions—whether the warmth and assurance that come through choices that lead to salvation or those that quietly dissuade from paths of righteousness—carry the message. Just as the leaves left their impression long after the leaves were no more, your choices will influence even after you are no more.</p>
<p>May we each be blessed with a deeper appreciation of the significance of our gift of agency: a gift with responsibility, a gift that is the foundation of our soul’s progress toward salvation. May we know that our daily exercise of agency has eternal reverberations. May we understand that we have both control and responsibility within the terms and conditions of the gift we have been given. May we know that <i>now is the time </i>to take seriously and give attention to the choices we make. May we know by the witness of the Spirit that the greatest reflection of the exercise of our agency is found when—against all odds, against all pressure, persuasion, and enticement—we still choose the right. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you in this opening session of the 2017 BYU Campus Education Week. This year’s theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 50:24, with special emphasis on these words: “And he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light.”
I am going to take a different approach to this theme than might be expected by exposing and illustrating some very cunning and effective ways that the “wicked one” prevents people from progressing and receiving more light (D&amp;C 93:39).
Many gospel principles come in pairs, meaning one is incomplete without the other. I want to refer to three of these doctrinal pairs today:

Agency and responsibility
Mercy and justice
Faith and works

When Satan is successful in dividing doctrinal pairs, he begins to wreak havoc upon mankind. It is one of his most cunning strategies to keep people from growing in the light.
You already know that faith without works really isn’t faith (see James 2:17). My primary focus will be on the other two doctrinal pairs: first, to illustrate how avoiding responsibility affects agency; and second, how “denying justice,” as it is referred to in the Book of Mormon (see Alma 42:30), affects mercy.
The Book of Mormon teaches us that we are agents to “act . . . and not to be acted upon” (2 Nephi 2:26)—or to be “free to act for [our]selves” (2 Nephi 10:23). This freedom of choice was not a gift of partial agency but of complete and total 100 percent agency. It was absolute in the sense that the One Perfect Parent never forces His children. He shows us the way and may even command us, but, “nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee” (Moses 3:17).
Assuming responsibility and being accountable for our choices are agency’s complementary principles (see D&amp;C 101:78). Responsibility is to recognize ourselves as being the cause for the effects or results of our choices—good or bad. On the negative side, it is to always own up to the consequences of poor choices.
Except for those held innocent, such as little children and the intellectually disabled, gospel doctrine teaches us that each person is responsible for the use of their agency and “will be punished for their own sins” (Articles of Faith 1:2).1 It isn’t just a heavenly principle but a law of nature—we reap what we sow.
Logically then, complete and total agency comes with complete and total responsibility:
 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it u</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">One of the most cunning aspects of the adversary’s efforts to thwart our Father in Heaven’s plan of happiness is his deceitful teaching that there is no evil influence or devil1 and his attempt to redefine evil as good and good as evil, darkness as light and light as darkness, and bitter as sweet and sweet as bitter!2
This is sometimes called a paradigm shift—or “when the usual way of thinking about or doing something is replaced by a new and different way,”3 thus portraying things to be exactly the opposite of what they really are. In his classic novel The Screwtape Letters, C. S. Lewis wrote from a senior devil’s point of view. Lewis inverted traditional values using irony and satire to make evil appear good and good appear evil.4
In this vein I had a provocative meeting with an internationally recognized advertising expert a few months ago. He is an unusually gifted and creative thinker. We were discussing the influence of evil and the consequences of bad choices.
He envisioned an interesting hypothetical account of the adversary (Lucifer) meeting with an advertising agency. The adversary described his dilemma: He and his followers had rebelled and rejected the Father’s plan and had come to understand they could not prevail against God. Lucifer understood that while the Father’s plan was about joy and happiness, his own plan was resulting in grief and misery. The problem, Lucifer explained to the ad executive, was how to attract followers.
After contemplating this problem, it was determined that Lucifer’s only hope of success was to achieve a paradigm shift or values inversion—in other words, to characterize the Father’s plan as resulting in grief and misery and Lucifer’s plan as resulting in joy and happiness.
While this contemplated meeting with an advertising agency is hypothetical, it serves a useful purpose. The truth is, not only do the enemies of Father’s plan attempt to undermine the doctrine and principles of the plan, but they also attempt to mischaracterize the blessings that flow from the plan. Their basic effort is to make that which is good, righteous, and joyful seem utterly miserable.
I will discuss some of the adversary’s efforts to mischaracterize and undermine the blessings of living according to the Father’s plan.
Word of Wisdom
My first example is the Word of Wisdom. I fully recognize that you magnificent students understand the importance of the Word of Wisdom and have agreed, on your honor, to live by it. However, over the course of a lifetime I have seen many of my friends’ lives blighted and sometimes destroyed by alcohol. An alcohol culture isn’t just about Church doctrine; it is about the health and happiness of everyone. You can be an important voice in educating society about the consequences of this issue.
In the Father’s plan, the Word of Wisdom—secti</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I was born in Mountain View, California, the second of (eventually) eleven children. We settled in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the east side of San Jose, not far from the rolling foothills that are crowned by the imposing Mount Hamilton, home to the Lick Observatory, “the first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory in the world.”1 The weather was usually pleasant, even during the warm, sunny days of summer. As spring yielded to summer, the foothills would turn from a verdant green to a cozy, warm brown. But even on hot days, a cool breeze would flow off the bay every afternoon just as temperatures were peaking for the day.
Our subdivision consisted of a single principal street with four cul-de-sacs branching off toward the east. To the south was a walnut orchard that, in a child’s mind, seemed dark and foreboding—the stuff of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. To the east was a large strawberry field. One day Mom sent my older brother, Jim, and me out to pick strawberries. I remember doing a lot of picking and eating; I don’t remember bringing much home in the bowl she gave us.
Shortly thereafter, bulldozers and earthmovers took over as Interstate 680 came to our neighborhood. The walnut orchard also gave way to construction. “Silicon Valley” had to be built, and it seemed we were in the middle of it.
When I was fourteen years old, my father decided to purchase a microcomputer kit. This seemed like a sensible activity for a systems analyst in Silicon Valley. He chose the Heathkit H-89, and it was as amazing in 1979 as an iPad is today! I am sorry to get a little nerdy here, but I need to paint the picture properly. The H-89 was an all-in-one model with a keyboard and a twelve-inch display built right in. Its brain was an eight-bit Zilog brand Z80 CPU2 that ran at more than two megahertz (that is more than two million clock cycles per second). The kit came standard with 16K of RAM,3 but since Dad bought three expansion packs over time, we eventually had an entire 56K of RAM in which to lose ourselves. (In contrast, a typical smartphone today has billions of bytes of RAM and executes billions of clock cycles each second.)
Dad let us older boys help build the thing, but, as I recall, I was the most zealous deputy in the bunch. We had to bolt and solder all sorts of parts together, and soon enough there was this box—a true marvel of engineering and a testament to not only mankind’s creativity but also our ability to follow complex instructions and manipulate tiny parts. There it was, sitting on our kitchen table with its fan purring, enthusiastically waiting for that next instruction to come in from its mass storage device, a cassette tape recorder. (Yes, it took another upgrade before we could use modern, high-capacity floppy disk technology.4)
The computer was built, so what next? I had to learn how to program it. I knew how it was as</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">We are and will be faced with all types of choices throughout our lives. Each choice we make or action we take carries some type of consequence. The consequence can be positive or negative. A consequence does not always have to be negative; I think we are conditioned to think of consequences as negative. Sometimes consequences appear to be both negative and positive, depending on your point of view.
Sometimes we make choices thinking we are doing good, only to have our good intentions and deeds backfire and make a bad situation worse. Sometimes we immediately regret a decision or choice. Sometimes regret comes later and with someone saying to us, “I told you so.” Other times we may say or do something that we later find out actually inspired or uplifted someone. Sometimes we choose not to make a choice and instead let nature or circumstances unfold as they will. This reminds me of several lines from one of my favorite songs by Rush called “Freewill”:
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill.
I will choose a path that’s clear;
I will choose freewill.
Choosing Your Path
One of the great blessings we enjoy in this life is the blessing of choice—choosing the path our life will take and, maybe more important, the type of person we want to become.
We have a huge number of directions we can steer our lives in. You can allow others to steer for you and guide you on the path. There are plenty of people who will be more than happy to tell you what you should and should not do. They may even let you pay them for their advice. You can also decide to do whatever you fancy—it is your life, after all, and God has blessed you with agency. Or you can let life happen and just roll with the changes. Or maybe, best yet, you can be proactive and make the choices that best suit you and the direction you want your life to take.
Let me caution you that simply making certain decisions does not guarantee that you will end up exactly where you expect to be. The choice I am talking about is the type of person you want to be, regardless of where your life and vocation take you.
When I was in junior high and high school I was interested in several careers. The first and foremost was to play professional football. The second was to coach football and be a PE teacher. The third and most fleeting was to be a lead singer for an epic hard rock band.
The lead singer career was the first to fade as I realized three facts about myself: (1) I am not a good singer or screamer, (2) I really don’t enjoy being on stage in front of people, and (3) I wasn’t really ready for the superstar lifestyle and all that comes with it.
My poor singing ability was reconfirmed to me some years ago when my ward choir pleaded for male voices. They said any male voice was welcome. I</span>
