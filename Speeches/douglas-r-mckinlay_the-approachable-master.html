  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I came to BYU after a career in advertising, and now Im enjoying my thirteenth year in a "career crescendo." I dont know what that means to those in music, but Ive enjoyed every minute of those thirteen years so far.

The field of sports is a wonderful place to find metaphors and analogies for life, and I would like to begin with one this morning: the phrase "leaving it all on the field," which is to say that one gives everything out there on the playing field, the court, or the stage, holding nothing back. There are times in our lives when this analogy makes particular sense. For example, when serving a mission you would want to make sure that you came home with no regrets, that you "left it all" in your field of labor. There is something awfully satisfying about giving 100 percent, whatever the assignment.

But what if your pre-earth assignment was to come to the playing field of mortality, where there would be forces of opposition trying to keep you from leaving it all on the field? Such is certainly the case with earth life. But how do we then give our all? What can we do to ensure that we leave this life with the fewest possible regrets? For the next few minutes I will discuss one sure way, and that is to come under the influence of the Master - the one perfect example of someone who indeed left it all on this very playing field.

And so I have titled my remarks this morning "The Approachable Master: Lifes Critical Relationship." Let me begin by putting a series of related questions to all of us:

Why is it that we do not befriend with greater intensity our Savior, "The Master of ocean and earth and skies,"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a level that truly affects - perhaps even drives - our own personal behavior?

Said another way, why do we not capitalize on the Spirit of Christ within all of us to more completely comprehend the Masters purpose and the will of the only name under heaven by which we may gain life eternal?&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Lastly, why do we not accept more openly the Saviors simple invitation to "come unto me?"

In much the same way President Ezra Taft Benson approached our tendency as a people to undervalue the positive effects of studying the Book of Mormon,&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; may I be bold enough this morning to suggest that the same condition may well apply for us as we come to know the Savior. There is so much more to gain by developing a truly interactive relationship with the Master. To use His own parable, could it be that we are the travelers on the highway and that the master has bid us to his wedding feast? Why would we not come?&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

We can learn of the Master, even love Him for all He has accomplished on our behalf, and yet still position ourselves beyond our own ability to receive many additional and ennobling blessings. It would be like joining a sports team but not going to practice, not benefiting from the coachs experience, and never actually taking the field.

Listen to the Saviors own injunction:

&lt;i&gt;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

And in our day, the clarion call from the Brethren is an echo from the corridors of time: "Come unto Christ." The reason this call never goes away is because once we are fully engaged with the Master, we become like the people of King Benjamin. After his landmark speech to his people, King Benjamin sent among them, desiring to know if they believed his message and if it had actually made a difference in their lives. Their unified response is an example to all of us:

&lt;i&gt;Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

As professed Christians and practicing Latter-day Saints, we embrace the doctrines set forth in the fourth article of faith: the first principle of the gospel is "faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," something that precedes all else. But, sadly, we sometimes become little more than "Facebook friends" with our Lord and Master, clicking our "like" button on Sunday and then only "visiting His page" when we have a special need or when prompted by another Sundays arrival.

As we exhibit this symbolic behavior, it is possible for us to become our own version of what the apostle Paul described in his discourse on charity "as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps we could change a word or two and make the phrase a more inner-facing interrogative: Have &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; become as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal?

So again, why is it that we move closer to the Savior on occasion, then drift away, then move closer, then drift away in an undulating kind of relationship, not unlike the movement of the tides?

Let me share some possible reasons why we might stray from a member of the Godhead who is most anxious to befriend us and most ready to receive us, regardless of our present circumstances.

An obvious place to begin is the sometimes subtle but nevertheless diabolically decreed role of the devil and his everlasting commitment to distance us from the influence of the Master. The devil will do all in his power to keep us from developing a strong personal bond with the Master that would strengthen us and guide us safely through the many vicissitudes of life. And let us remember, the further we are from the influence of the Master, the closer we are to the influence of our most formidable foe.

The adversary knows that if he can make us feel alone, even when we arent, we become much more vulnerable to his very careful, very strategic advances. Here are two of the many strategies he uses to keep us from the Master:

&lt;b&gt;1. He convinces us that we are unworthy - even through prayer - to enter the presence of the Master.&lt;/b&gt; He does this using the tactics of guilt, shame, or embarrassment, knowing that we "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Satan reminds us that the Master is perfect and we are not, thus increasing the distance between us and the Savior.

&lt;b&gt;2. He makes us believe that we can do all things on our own,&lt;/b&gt; that we have no need for the Saviors help, just as a small child who responds to parental guidance by saying, "I can do it myself." This is commonly known in LDS parlance as "the pride cycle" - and its not a good place for us to find ourselves as adults.

Some years ago, while serving with the missionaries in the Arizona Tucson Mission, I created a series of what my bride, Betty Jo, likes to call "doctrinal diagrams." The first diagram deals with what I have termed the Drift Phenomenon, where we drift closer and then farther apart from the Lord.

Say you receive a new calling in the Church and are totally overwhelmed. You need the influence of the Master in order to execute your calling. He, of course, responds with the appropriate inspiration, but, as time goes along, you get more comfortable with the calling and your ability to perform it. What may inadvertently happen is that you begin to drift away from the need for constant inspiration and toward a reliance on your own abilities. The theoretical danger zone is when we begin to depend more on ourselves and less on the Spirit. And now, for just a moment, ponder where you might place yourself on these lines in relation to your present Church assignment.

Not that you would ever plan on, or even notice, this shift happening; it just seems to be a part of what King Benjamin might have called "the natural man syndrome"&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; - that tendency to drift away from the Master and His influence when we are not in personal-crisis mode. Once again we become that proverbial three-year-old, saying, or perhaps indignantly shouting, "I can do it myself." We are exactly where the adversary would like us to be - out there on our own.

On the other hand, if we "lean not unto [our] own understanding"&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;or on "the arm of flesh,"&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and as we stay close to the Masters influence, it is easy to see a dramatic difference. We might call this the Non-Drift Phenomenon or the Magnifying-Your-Calling Phenomenon, where we stay close to the Lord. Imagine the power that can come as you become increasingly proficient in your calling while enjoying an ever-increasing degree of spiritual influence from the Master. To borrow a word from a famous MasterCard advertising campaign, this power is "priceless" - suggesting a value difference between things we can buy (the temporal) and things we cannot buy (the spiritual).

Speaking of temporal things, consider the time and energy we spend at this and perhaps other institutions preparing for and advancing our careers. Let us remember that - unless I miss my guess - our careers will not rise with us in the Resurrection. Certainly I will be unemployed, since I doubt the existence of or need for billboards, TV sets, YouTube, the Internet, or i-anything on the other side of the veil. I trust that even our two surgeon sons may have to look elsewhere for employment.

A very long time ago, as an undergraduate student at BYU, I memorized this quote from Harvard philosopher James Allen that points out the danger of "going it alone":

&lt;i&gt;Man is the causer (though nearly always unconsciously) of his&lt;/i&gt;[own] &lt;i&gt;circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Making critical life decisions without the aid of the Masters direct spiritual influence is like embarking on a long sea voyage in a craft without a rudder, a helm, or perhaps even a mast.

Here are three more strategies to add to our list of ways in which the adversary keeps us from developing a broader, deeper, and more critical relationship with our Master:

&lt;b&gt;3. He creates doubt about our own self-worth and our God-given abilities.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;4. He gives us a feeling of entitlement.&lt;/b&gt; Since we are all children of God, we are, somehow - amazingly - due a divine inheritance. Someone with the attitude of entitlement says, "Its never my fault. Surely the blame for my inability to perform to expectations must lie with another. Besides, isnt the Savior supposed to be my all-time safety net?"

&lt;b&gt;5. He helps us develop our powers of procrastination&lt;/b&gt; (not that we need help here). After all, there is always and forever tomorrow, right? What could possibly be the rush?

My guess is that at one time or another we have all felt these negative tuggings or feelings in our lives, and we have, to some extent, bought into some of the mortal foibles and frailties with which the adversary is so awfully familiar.

Let me now share a very personal experience from years ago that may serve to illustrate this point. I was set apart as a stake president by two General Authorities, and during the blessing, certain - as I viewed them - promises were mentioned, one of which related to the success of a new business venture I had just undertaken. But things did not go well business-wise. Unbeknownst to me, I had started an advertising agency on the cusp of a serious recession. After weeks of unease, early one morning, with many unanswered questions in my heart, a terrible uncertainty and a feeling of being alone washed over me like a waterfall of doubt. Although going into business for myself seemed like an inspired decision at the time, I had begun to second-guess the rightness of my choice, and I even wondered about the inspired words that had been uttered in that blessing just a few months earlier.

Fortunately I followed a common pattern and went to the scriptures and to the Lord, anxiously looking for answers - &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt;answer that would mitigate my vexed state of mind. I was pondering the words in Matthew 28 about the risen Lord, specifically what the angel said to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary who were in search of the Master, searching just as I was on that morning and perhaps as you may be searching today: "He is not here: for he is risen, as he said."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

The details of what followed are not important here, except to say that in my scriptures there is written in the margin a little note that says, "Special experience." The Lord blessed me that day with a powerful witness of the reality of the Savior as my personal advocate with the Father, as the Creator of heaven and earth, and as the would-be Friend of all mankind. Today I testify that He lives and that He wants nothing more than to help us perform well on this playing field of life.

Yes, the business survived the recession and, happily, all the words spoken in my blessing were fulfilled. More important, I learned something about the definition of the phrase "in the Lords own way."

Lets look more closely into the self-doubt scenario we sometimes find ourselves in - that space between our gospel goals and our actual behavior against those goals. There is an interesting space between where we may be performing now and where wed like to be. Lets just call it the "mortal shortfall gap." This is where many of us get into trouble, allowing self-doubt to creep in and create a series of performance stress risers and debilitative, non-productive thinking. If we are not careful, we succumb to another "flaxen cord"&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; and start to envision the gap widening to the point that we begin to lose faith. Once again we end up exactly where the adversary wants us: solitary and doubtful of our own abilities.

But lest we find this gap troubling, there is good news: the Master also knows full well the challenges of mortality. And, fortunately, He has both the ability and the predisposition to fill that mortal shortfall gap.

When we fully accept Christ as our personal Savior, Advocate, and Redeemer, the gap fills so completely with hope and understanding and promise that the mortal shortfall gap becomes narrower and narrower until that eventual "perfect day."&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Actually, the diminishing effect of our shortfall is the emancipating and empowering effect of the Saviors Atonement. For our part, a change in attitude or a mighty change of heart&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; to close that gap helps our performance considerably.

Listen to what the ancient and articulate prophet Alma had to say concerning the Atonement:

&lt;i&gt;And he will take upon him&lt;/i&gt; [our] &lt;i&gt;infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;

And in our day the Savior has spoken to us in the Doctrine and Covenants with these reassuring words: "For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent."&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;

For a moment now, lets revisit that potentially devastating alone feeling, a feeling I suppose has come over all of us at one time or another, whether we were physically isolated or perhaps within in a supportive group but still very much alone in our thoughts. This feeling of abject loneliness is another key tactic used by the adversary to create distance between us and our Savior.

Satan would have us believe that no one - not even the Master - can reach us and relate to us on a personal level and feel exactly how we feel in our terribly unique circumstances. But the Master knows, and He feels your &lt;i&gt;precise&lt;/i&gt; pain and anguish, regardless of its source and intensity. The Savior has vicariously suffered your &lt;i&gt;exact same suffering.&lt;/i&gt; Pauls marvelous discourse on this subject in Hebrews offers "grace to help in [our] time of need."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; The last few verses from Hebrews have brought peace and solace to my soul over the years when I have felt particularly alone in this world, even though surrounded by friends:

&lt;i&gt;For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

I love that invitation: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace." Speaking of grace, I for one believe that when it comes to our individual progress toward our goals, vector almost certainly trumps velocity. However long it takes, let us not lose our sense of direction.

Here is one way to look at the Masters limitless ability to connect to us across the entire spectrum of human emotion: As mortals, we go through life and can experience some pretty low lows and also some pretty high highs. But even though the Saviors earthly experience was every bit as real and visceral as our own, the Savior is on a scale that supersedes anything the rest of us can possibly encounter. We simply cannot get outside His ability to relate to us personally and individually. Well-meaning friends may offer their best approximate &lt;i&gt;sympathy,&lt;/i&gt; but only the Savior offers ultimate and absolute&lt;i&gt; empathy.&lt;/i&gt;

Though I am a teaching professor and not a scientist per se, I love the way the Lord invites us to participate in the scientific process as described by Alma (who just might have been something of a scientist himself). Alma suggested that we experiment on the word in the crucible of the real world:

&lt;i&gt;But behold, if you will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

Isnt that the way of the scientist and the researcher? They gather all of the empirical evidence - all the data they can - and develop a theory; then they create a repeatable, predictable experiment that proves or disproves the theory.

The Savior, both in His own recorded words and through the words of His holy prophets, has invited us to come unto Him, to experiment for ourselves on the truthfulness of His gospel, and to claim the attendant blessings.

I appreciate so much the Saviors Intercessory Prayer in which He gives us all a glimpse of the possible glory inherent in a relationship with Him - which is a type of the oneness relationship He has with the Father. Let me share a few verses from John.

First, the Savior prayed for His apostles:

&lt;i&gt;And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;

And then He prayed for the rest of us:

&lt;i&gt;Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;

We began this morning with the analogy of leaving it all on the field. How is it possible for us to not only "take the field" of this earthly life but to also come away victorious? I suggest two ways: first, by eschewing the strategic advances of the adversary, and, second, by developing that critical, personal, interactive relationship with the Master.

May we not be found undervaluing the role of the Master, whose arms are outstretched still. We have the opportunity here and now to make Him not just a "Facebook friend" but a most personal, powerful, and influential advocate. Let us not buy into the adversarys attempts to keep us away from the everlasting peace, safety, and eventual exaltation available if we but commend our own personal will into the Lords all-powerful hands.

I testify of the reality of the living Christ, just as the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles have declared in a modern-day proclamation.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; I testify that as we boldly approach Him, our own personal performance becomes our own personal legacy. As we engage with the Master, may we leave it all on the playing field of this life, which is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>I came to BYU after a career in advertising, and now Im enjoying my thirteenth year in a "career crescendo." I dont know what that means to those in music, but Ive enjoyed every minute of those thirteen years so far.</p>
<p>The field of sports is a wonderful place to find metaphors and analogies for life, and I would like to begin with one this morning: the phrase "leaving it all on the field," which is to say that one gives everything out there on the playing field, the court, or the stage, holding nothing back. There are times in our lives when this analogy makes particular sense. For example, when serving a mission you would want to make sure that you came home with no regrets, that you "left it all" in your field of labor. There is something awfully satisfying about giving 100 percent, whatever the assignment.</p>
<p>But what if your pre-earth assignment was to come to the playing field of mortality, where there would be forces of opposition trying to keep you from leaving it all on the field? Such is certainly the case with earth life. But how do we then give our all? What can we do to ensure that we leave this life with the fewest possible regrets? For the next few minutes I will discuss one sure way, and that is to come under the influence of the Master - the one perfect example of someone who indeed left it all on this very playing field.</p>
<p>And so I have titled my remarks this morning "The Approachable Master: Lifes Critical Relationship." Let me begin by putting a series of related questions to all of us:</p>
<p>Why is it that we do not befriend with greater intensity our Savior, "The Master of ocean and earth and skies,"<sup>1</sup> at a level that truly affects - perhaps even drives - our own personal behavior?</p>
<p>Said another way, why do we not capitalize on the Spirit of Christ within all of us to more completely comprehend the Masters purpose and the will of the only name under heaven by which we may gain life eternal?<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Lastly, why do we not accept more openly the Saviors simple invitation to "come unto me?"</p>
<p>In much the same way President Ezra Taft Benson approached our tendency as a people to undervalue the positive effects of studying the Book of Mormon,<sup>3</sup> may I be bold enough this morning to suggest that the same condition may well apply for us as we come to know the Savior. There is so much more to gain by developing a truly interactive relationship with the Master. To use His own parable, could it be that we are the travelers on the highway and that the master has bid us to his wedding feast? Why would we not come?<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>We can learn of the Master, even love Him for all He has accomplished on our behalf, and yet still position ourselves beyond our own ability to receive many additional and ennobling blessings. It would be like joining a sports team but not going to practice, not benefiting from the coachs experience, and never actually taking the field.</p>
<p>Listen to the Saviors own injunction:</p>
<p><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i></p>
<p><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i></p>
<p><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>And in our day, the clarion call from the Brethren is an echo from the corridors of time: "Come unto Christ." The reason this call never goes away is because once we are fully engaged with the Master, we become like the people of King Benjamin. After his landmark speech to his people, King Benjamin sent among them, desiring to know if they believed his message and if it had actually made a difference in their lives. Their unified response is an example to all of us:</p>
<p><i>Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>As professed Christians and practicing Latter-day Saints, we embrace the doctrines set forth in the fourth article of faith: the first principle of the gospel is "faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," something that precedes all else. But, sadly, we sometimes become little more than "Facebook friends" with our Lord and Master, clicking our "like" button on Sunday and then only "visiting His page" when we have a special need or when prompted by another Sundays arrival.</p>
<p>As we exhibit this symbolic behavior, it is possible for us to become our own version of what the apostle Paul described in his discourse on charity "as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."<sup>7</sup> Perhaps we could change a word or two and make the phrase a more inner-facing interrogative: Have <i>I</i> become as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal?</p>
<p>So again, why is it that we move closer to the Savior on occasion, then drift away, then move closer, then drift away in an undulating kind of relationship, not unlike the movement of the tides?</p>
<p>Let me share some possible reasons why we might stray from a member of the Godhead who is most anxious to befriend us and most ready to receive us, regardless of our present circumstances.</p>
<p>An obvious place to begin is the sometimes subtle but nevertheless diabolically decreed role of the devil and his everlasting commitment to distance us from the influence of the Master. The devil will do all in his power to keep us from developing a strong personal bond with the Master that would strengthen us and guide us safely through the many vicissitudes of life. And let us remember, the further we are from the influence of the Master, the closer we are to the influence of our most formidable foe.</p>
<p>The adversary knows that if he can make us feel alone, even when we arent, we become much more vulnerable to his very careful, very strategic advances. Here are two of the many strategies he uses to keep us from the Master:</p>
<p><b>1. He convinces us that we are unworthy - even through prayer - to enter the presence of the Master.</b> He does this using the tactics of guilt, shame, or embarrassment, knowing that we "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."<sup>8</sup> Satan reminds us that the Master is perfect and we are not, thus increasing the distance between us and the Savior.</p>
<p><b>2. He makes us believe that we can do all things on our own,</b> that we have no need for the Saviors help, just as a small child who responds to parental guidance by saying, "I can do it myself." This is commonly known in LDS parlance as "the pride cycle" - and its not a good place for us to find ourselves as adults.</p>
<p>Some years ago, while serving with the missionaries in the Arizona Tucson Mission, I created a series of what my bride, Betty Jo, likes to call "doctrinal diagrams." The first diagram deals with what I have termed the Drift Phenomenon, where we drift closer and then farther apart from the Lord.</p>
<p>Say you receive a new calling in the Church and are totally overwhelmed. You need the influence of the Master in order to execute your calling. He, of course, responds with the appropriate inspiration, but, as time goes along, you get more comfortable with the calling and your ability to perform it. What may inadvertently happen is that you begin to drift away from the need for constant inspiration and toward a reliance on your own abilities. The theoretical danger zone is when we begin to depend more on ourselves and less on the Spirit. And now, for just a moment, ponder where you might place yourself on these lines in relation to your present Church assignment.</p>
<p>Not that you would ever plan on, or even notice, this shift happening; it just seems to be a part of what King Benjamin might have called "the natural man syndrome"<sup>9</sup> - that tendency to drift away from the Master and His influence when we are not in personal-crisis mode. Once again we become that proverbial three-year-old, saying, or perhaps indignantly shouting, "I can do it myself." We are exactly where the adversary would like us to be - out there on our own.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we "lean not unto [our] own understanding"<sup>10</sup>or on "the arm of flesh,"<sup>11</sup> and as we stay close to the Masters influence, it is easy to see a dramatic difference. We might call this the Non-Drift Phenomenon or the Magnifying-Your-Calling Phenomenon, where we stay close to the Lord. Imagine the power that can come as you become increasingly proficient in your calling while enjoying an ever-increasing degree of spiritual influence from the Master. To borrow a word from a famous MasterCard advertising campaign, this power is "priceless" - suggesting a value difference between things we can buy (the temporal) and things we cannot buy (the spiritual).</p>
<p>Speaking of temporal things, consider the time and energy we spend at this and perhaps other institutions preparing for and advancing our careers. Let us remember that - unless I miss my guess - our careers will not rise with us in the Resurrection. Certainly I will be unemployed, since I doubt the existence of or need for billboards, TV sets, YouTube, the Internet, or i-anything on the other side of the veil. I trust that even our two surgeon sons may have to look elsewhere for employment.</p>
<p>A very long time ago, as an undergraduate student at BYU, I memorized this quote from Harvard philosopher James Allen that points out the danger of "going it alone":</p>
<p><i>Man is the causer (though nearly always unconsciously) of his</i>[own] <i>circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Making critical life decisions without the aid of the Masters direct spiritual influence is like embarking on a long sea voyage in a craft without a rudder, a helm, or perhaps even a mast.</p>
<p>Here are three more strategies to add to our list of ways in which the adversary keeps us from developing a broader, deeper, and more critical relationship with our Master:</p>
<p><b>3. He creates doubt about our own self-worth and our God-given abilities.</b></p>
<p><b>4. He gives us a feeling of entitlement.</b> Since we are all children of God, we are, somehow - amazingly - due a divine inheritance. Someone with the attitude of entitlement says, "Its never my fault. Surely the blame for my inability to perform to expectations must lie with another. Besides, isnt the Savior supposed to be my all-time safety net?"</p>
<p><b>5. He helps us develop our powers of procrastination</b> (not that we need help here). After all, there is always and forever tomorrow, right? What could possibly be the rush?</p>
<p>My guess is that at one time or another we have all felt these negative tuggings or feelings in our lives, and we have, to some extent, bought into some of the mortal foibles and frailties with which the adversary is so awfully familiar.</p>
<p>Let me now share a very personal experience from years ago that may serve to illustrate this point. I was set apart as a stake president by two General Authorities, and during the blessing, certain - as I viewed them - promises were mentioned, one of which related to the success of a new business venture I had just undertaken. But things did not go well business-wise. Unbeknownst to me, I had started an advertising agency on the cusp of a serious recession. After weeks of unease, early one morning, with many unanswered questions in my heart, a terrible uncertainty and a feeling of being alone washed over me like a waterfall of doubt. Although going into business for myself seemed like an inspired decision at the time, I had begun to second-guess the rightness of my choice, and I even wondered about the inspired words that had been uttered in that blessing just a few months earlier.</p>
<p>Fortunately I followed a common pattern and went to the scriptures and to the Lord, anxiously looking for answers - <i>any</i>answer that would mitigate my vexed state of mind. I was pondering the words in Matthew 28 about the risen Lord, specifically what the angel said to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary who were in search of the Master, searching just as I was on that morning and perhaps as you may be searching today: "He is not here: for he is risen, as he said."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>The details of what followed are not important here, except to say that in my scriptures there is written in the margin a little note that says, "Special experience." The Lord blessed me that day with a powerful witness of the reality of the Savior as my personal advocate with the Father, as the Creator of heaven and earth, and as the would-be Friend of all mankind. Today I testify that He lives and that He wants nothing more than to help us perform well on this playing field of life.</p>
<p>Yes, the business survived the recession and, happily, all the words spoken in my blessing were fulfilled. More important, I learned something about the definition of the phrase "in the Lords own way."</p>
<p>Lets look more closely into the self-doubt scenario we sometimes find ourselves in - that space between our gospel goals and our actual behavior against those goals. There is an interesting space between where we may be performing now and where wed like to be. Lets just call it the "mortal shortfall gap." This is where many of us get into trouble, allowing self-doubt to creep in and create a series of performance stress risers and debilitative, non-productive thinking. If we are not careful, we succumb to another "flaxen cord"<sup>14</sup> and start to envision the gap widening to the point that we begin to lose faith. Once again we end up exactly where the adversary wants us: solitary and doubtful of our own abilities.</p>
<p>But lest we find this gap troubling, there is good news: the Master also knows full well the challenges of mortality. And, fortunately, He has both the ability and the predisposition to fill that mortal shortfall gap.</p>
<p>When we fully accept Christ as our personal Savior, Advocate, and Redeemer, the gap fills so completely with hope and understanding and promise that the mortal shortfall gap becomes narrower and narrower until that eventual "perfect day."<sup>15</sup> Actually, the diminishing effect of our shortfall is the emancipating and empowering effect of the Saviors Atonement. For our part, a change in attitude or a mighty change of heart<sup>16</sup> to close that gap helps our performance considerably.</p>
<p>Listen to what the ancient and articulate prophet Alma had to say concerning the Atonement:</p>
<p><i>And he will take upon him</i> [our] <i>infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><sup>17</sup></p>
<p>And in our day the Savior has spoken to us in the Doctrine and Covenants with these reassuring words: "For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent."<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>For a moment now, lets revisit that potentially devastating alone feeling, a feeling I suppose has come over all of us at one time or another, whether we were physically isolated or perhaps within in a supportive group but still very much alone in our thoughts. This feeling of abject loneliness is another key tactic used by the adversary to create distance between us and our Savior.</p>
<p>Satan would have us believe that no one - not even the Master - can reach us and relate to us on a personal level and feel exactly how we feel in our terribly unique circumstances. But the Master knows, and He feels your <i>precise</i> pain and anguish, regardless of its source and intensity. The Savior has vicariously suffered your <i>exact same suffering.</i> Pauls marvelous discourse on this subject in Hebrews offers "grace to help in [our] time of need."<sup>19</sup> The last few verses from Hebrews have brought peace and solace to my soul over the years when I have felt particularly alone in this world, even though surrounded by friends:</p>
<p><i>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</i></p>
<p><i>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</i></p>
<p><i>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</i><sup>20</sup></p>
<p><i>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</i></p>
<p><i>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</i><sup>21</sup></p>
<p>I love that invitation: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace." Speaking of grace, I for one believe that when it comes to our individual progress toward our goals, vector almost certainly trumps velocity. However long it takes, let us not lose our sense of direction.</p>
<p>Here is one way to look at the Masters limitless ability to connect to us across the entire spectrum of human emotion: As mortals, we go through life and can experience some pretty low lows and also some pretty high highs. But even though the Saviors earthly experience was every bit as real and visceral as our own, the Savior is on a scale that supersedes anything the rest of us can possibly encounter. We simply cannot get outside His ability to relate to us personally and individually. Well-meaning friends may offer their best approximate <i>sympathy,</i> but only the Savior offers ultimate and absolute<i> empathy.</i></p>
<p>Though I am a teaching professor and not a scientist per se, I love the way the Lord invites us to participate in the scientific process as described by Alma (who just might have been something of a scientist himself). Alma suggested that we experiment on the word in the crucible of the real world:</p>
<p><i>But behold, if you will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you.</i><sup>22</sup></p>
<p>Isnt that the way of the scientist and the researcher? They gather all of the empirical evidence - all the data they can - and develop a theory; then they create a repeatable, predictable experiment that proves or disproves the theory.</p>
<p>The Savior, both in His own recorded words and through the words of His holy prophets, has invited us to come unto Him, to experiment for ourselves on the truthfulness of His gospel, and to claim the attendant blessings.</p>
<p>I appreciate so much the Saviors Intercessory Prayer in which He gives us all a glimpse of the possible glory inherent in a relationship with Him - which is a type of the oneness relationship He has with the Father. Let me share a few verses from John.</p>
<p>First, the Savior prayed for His apostles:</p>
<p><i>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</i><sup>23</sup></p>
<p>And then He prayed for the rest of us:</p>
<p><i>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</i></p>
<p><i>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</i><sup>24</sup></p>
<p>We began this morning with the analogy of leaving it all on the field. How is it possible for us to not only "take the field" of this earthly life but to also come away victorious? I suggest two ways: first, by eschewing the strategic advances of the adversary, and, second, by developing that critical, personal, interactive relationship with the Master.</p>
<p>May we not be found undervaluing the role of the Master, whose arms are outstretched still. We have the opportunity here and now to make Him not just a "Facebook friend" but a most personal, powerful, and influential advocate. Let us not buy into the adversarys attempts to keep us away from the everlasting peace, safety, and eventual exaltation available if we but commend our own personal will into the Lords all-powerful hands.</p>
<p>I testify of the reality of the living Christ, just as the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles have declared in a modern-day proclamation.<sup>25</sup> I testify that as we boldly approach Him, our own personal performance becomes our own personal legacy. As we engage with the Master, may we leave it all on the playing field of this life, which is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During our mission in Canada, my wife and I gave a "last instruction" to departing missionaries the day before they went home. Each of these young elders and sisters were heroes to us, and we wanted their transition home to be very, very successful. Our instruction was given with love and good fun. I particularly enjoyed instructing on dating and marriage.
One afternoon as I stood at the blackboard during a last instruction, the Spirit pressed Helaman 5:12 deeply into my mind. This scripture came from what could have been the Book of Mormon prophet Helamans "last instruction" to his sons prior to their departure for their magnificent mission to the Nephites and the Lamanites.
We all quoted the scripture together:
And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
What a magnificent verse of scripture. Think of it: Helaman promised us that if we build our foundation upon our Savior, we cannot fall, regardless of what Satan throws at us. What a powerful promise!
Our Savior gave the same promise in the Sermon on the Mount:
Whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken . . . unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock - 
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.1
I bet a lot of you Primary graduates are thinking of a song. Would you sing it with me - just the first two verses, with hand motions?
The wise man built his house upon the rock,
The wise man built his house upon the rock,
The wise man built his house upon the rock,
And the rains came tumbling down.
The rains came down, and the floods came up,
The rains came down, and the floods came up,
The rains came down, and the floods came up,
And the house on the rock stood still.2
Thank you! Doesnt this simple song teach a powerful lesson?
Luke put it slightly differently:
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them . . .
. . . is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.3
When a person comes to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and he</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Today I would like to talk about some of the big issues of our time through the lens of history and literature as well as the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We live in a day of technological and scientific marvels. It is also a time of uncertainty - one in which many question whether or not faith and religion have a place in their lives or in the public square. You too will have to decide whether faith has an enduring place in your own life.
In fact, there are dramatic changes occurring within this country as it relates to faith and religion. A recent Pew Research Center study reported a dramatic decline in the share of the U.S. population that identifies as Christian. From 2007 to 2014 - in just seven years - it fell by an extraordinary 8 percent.1 While the drop is occurring across the board, it is especially pronounced among young adults. The world today poses many threats to faith in God, and the unfortunate fact is that faith in God is waning.
This is not the first time in history that such a crisis of faith has loomed. There was a similar period around 100 years ago. As the twentieth century opened, the world held great hope and enthusiasm for the future. Science was supplying astounding breakthroughs at every turn and the world seemed to be rushing toward a modern period when mankind, through its own self-generated progress and technology, might finally be able to solve the ancient problems of our world.
Consider some of the varied discoveries and inventions in just the first decade of the twentieth century. The modern escalator was invented - perhaps a kind of metaphor of mans supposedly inevitable rise. Marconi sent the first transatlantic radio signal. The vacuum cleaner and the tractor were developed - harbingers of liberation from more arduous forms of labor. The Wright brothers flew the first manned flight. Albert Einstein stunned the world with his theory of relativity. Henry Ford produced more than 10,000 cars on the first assembly line of its kind. The world saw its first talking motion picture and Marie Curie discovered radium.2
Cultural historian Richard Tarnas characterized the period this way:
Using his own natural intelligence, and without the aid of Holy Scriptures divine revelation, man had penetrated natures mysteries, transformed his universe, and immeasurably enhanced his existence. . . . His own wits and will could change his world. Science gave man a new faith - not only in scientific knowledge, but in himself.3
This period of time gave rise to what is known as "the myth of progress" - that is, the idea that mankind was somehow destined to rise inexorably on this wave of scientific progress to a new Eden. So it was that on the eve of the First World War, as the quest for power and political dominance reared its ugly head yet again in Europe, the response was a sadly naive one.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I feel honored and humbled to have received the assignment from the First Presidency to speak to you precious young people today. I hope that you have an appreciation of how much the prophet and the First Presidency care about you and love you. You are among "the noble and great."1
[A man arrived] home from work to find a very small girl sitting on the curb in front of his house, crying. He asked if he could help. Through her sobs she explained that she was lost. He told her that this was his house and his wife was inside. He told her he knew she shouldnt go with strangers, but if she felt comfortable going inside, he and his wife would try to find her home. They went into his house, and his wife, Linda, began to console the little girl. "Im sure you must be very frightened," she said.
"I was frightened," the girl responded, "until I saw the picture of Jesus hanging on your wall. Then I knew I would be safe."2
It is the same for us all. The answer always is Jesus Christ. At times you may feel that you are sitting on the curb lost and afraid, but if you will look to the Savior, He will guide you safely home. He is the one infallible source of help for each of us, my dear young adult friends.
One of the most profound and sublime of gospel understandings is the doctrine of law. It is stated so simply in the Doctrine and Covenants: "That which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same."3 By law, the Father governs us within His great plan of happiness. He sent His Son to show us the way. We learn of Him. We follow Him. We have faith in Him. We pray in His name. Because of His enabling Atonement we can grow, repent, and do what is necessary to invite the fulness of Heavenly Fathers blessings. And we do all of this by law. Within the law, each of us is fully responsible. To have the law work in our lives, we must act; we must stand up from the curb and follow Him.
In my sweet interactions with young people in both single and married stakes and as a mission president, I have seen how each young person must discover and then choose to walk his or her own personal path. Sometimes we are tempted to measure our progress by looking at what others are doing or have achieved. Your path is unique to you. Only you can receive heavenly guidance to pursue your path. If you choose to take detours, then you and only you can find your way back. President Henry B. Eyring taught:
Heavenly Father has perfect foresight, knows each of us, and knows our future. He knows what difficulties we will pass through. He sent His Son to suffer so that He would know how to succor us in all our trials.4
Christ understands and is aware of your personal young adult decisions; your questions, hopes, dreams, and needs; and the intents of your heart5 - and even y</span>
