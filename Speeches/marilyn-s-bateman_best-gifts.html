  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Last February Sister Marjorie Hinckley, wife of our prophet, was chosen by the BYU student leaders to receive the Exemplary Womanhood Award. The award is a special recognition given to a woman whose life exemplifies the teachings of Jesus Christ. Upon receiving the award, Sister Hinckley responded to the honor by saying: “Those who have been active in the Church all their lives have been made by the Church. The Church has made me what I am.” Sister Hinckley’s life reflects all that the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches. She has always been a believer in the truthfulness of the gospel. She has lived what she believes and she is what she believes.

As I thought about Sister Hinckley’s comments, it brought to mind the words of another great woman who lived what she believed—the French peasant girl Joan of Arc: &lt;i&gt;Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing, nevertheless they give up their lives to that little or nothing. One life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it’s gone. But to surrender what you are, and live without belief—that’s more terrible than dying—more terrible than dying young.&lt;/i&gt; [Maxwell Anderson, &lt;i&gt;Joan of Lorraine,&lt;/i&gt; act 2]

I would like to share with you some of my beliefs and feelings about the things that make a difference in my life—that which defines me. First, I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. It is of the utmost importance to me. The gospel gives us an understanding of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going. The gospel teaches us about our relationship with God. We are his spirit children, and our destiny is to return to our heavenly home if we are true and faithful to his principles and ordinances. I know that the principles and ordinances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are the strait and narrow path back to our eternal home. Jesus Christ is the firstborn of the Father and is his Only Begotten Son. He is our Elder Brother. I believe Christ has extended his grace and love to all of our Father’s children through his atoning sacrifice. Our faithfulness will determine the reach of those blessings. He loves all people on the earth, and he expects us to develop the ability to love as he loved. He is our example. I know that Heavenly Father has blessed us—all of us—with every good gift to enable us to find our way back to him.

I wish to list a few of the great gifts offered to us with the hope that we will all ponder how we accept these gifts in our lives. A gift that is not accepted or appreciated becomes diminished. The first gift is the gift of life. President Joseph Fielding Smith said:

&lt;i&gt;There is no greater blessing that can come than the blessing of birth. One third of the hosts of heaven, because of rebellion, were denied that privilege, and hence they have no bodies of flesh and bones, that great gift of God.&lt;/i&gt; [Joseph Fielding Smith, &lt;i&gt;Doctrines of Salvation&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954), 1:116]

What a blessing it is to live—to be alive at this time. It is a blessing to live where we live and to be who we are. Do you ever think about this and ask, “Why me? Why am I so blessed?” We are fortunate to know the purpose of our mortal lives. We are blessed to have the challenges that come to us. These trials cause us to grow. As we experience those stretching times, we are preparing to partake of the gift that the Savior so obediently and lovingly gave us—the gift of everlasting life—even eternal life if we endure to the end. We must not waste the days of our probationary time in mortality (see 2 Nephi 9:27).

In conjunction with the gift of life is the blessing of parenthood—the opportunity to give life. I am thankful for my parents, for the life they gave me. I am thankful for their love and nurturing throughout my life—teaching me how to live. My 80-year-old mother continues to be a wonderful role model for me. I see so many good things in her. She continues to teach me.

I am grateful for the sacred responsibility of being a parent. As the years have gone by, my role and responsibilities connected with parenthood have changed. But I am constantly renewed and challenged as a mother and as a grandmother. Bored—never! I love our family. I have learned so much throughout the years by being a mother. My children (that includes the grandchildren) continue to teach me.

I believe in marriage if at all possible. We should all seek for a marriage in the house of the Lord. That is where eternal blessings are found. I am so thankful for my eternal companion. I appreciate that which we share as parents, but even more important are those sacred thoughts and feelings we share together as husband and wife.

Again, it is a wonderful gift to know that we are children of God with a divine purpose. While in Hong Kong a number of years ago, my mother and I went on a tour of that beautiful city and surrounding area. The young woman tour guide became interested in us and asked about our homeland. We told her we were from the state of Utah. We also volunteered that we were Latter-day Saints and asked her if she had seen any Mormon missionaries there. She replied that she had heard of them, but she had no interest in religion or even in a Supreme Being. She then said: “I believe in only one thing, and that is myself—that is how the young generation feel in this city.” She went on to say: “We call it egoism. We believe in doing and accumulating all you can for yourself—no one else matters.”

Many people live their lives this way. It appears that all they care about is themselves. But I had never heard anyone admit to such a philosophy. I was surprised and realized that she was searching for a way to make her life meaningful. I thought of the scripture in Matthew 16:25–26:

&lt;i&gt;For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&lt;/i&gt;

The young lady did not understand who she is. She was not able to enjoy the gift of knowing that she is a daughter of a Heavenly Father and that her life has purpose beyond herself.

We are a blessed people. There are so many gifts that we share in our associations. We enjoy the gifts of love, of friendships—a warm handshake, an arm around the shoulder, a smile, a sincere greeting. We enjoy the gifts of a listening ear, of testimonies shared, and of service rendered in so many ways.

Do we accept that which has been extended to us with gratitude? Do we see these blessings as gifts from God—as well as gifts from those around us? Most important of all, are we good gift givers? I once heard Elder Neal A. Maxwell give this quote from G. K. Chesterton: “How much larger [our lives] would be if [we] could become smaller in it” (Gilbert K. Chesterton, “The Maniac,” &lt;i&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/i&gt; [New York: John Lane Company, 1909], pp. 34–35). God bless all of us to look outside ourselves and share our great gifts with others, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Last February Sister Marjorie Hinckley, wife of our prophet, was chosen by the BYU student leaders to receive the Exemplary Womanhood Award. The award is a special recognition given to a woman whose life exemplifies the teachings of Jesus Christ. Upon receiving the award, Sister Hinckley responded to the honor by saying: “Those who have been active in the Church all their lives have been made by the Church. The Church has made me what I am.” Sister Hinckley’s life reflects all that the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches. She has always been a believer in the truthfulness of the gospel. She has lived what she believes and she is what she believes.</p>
<p>As I thought about Sister Hinckley’s comments, it brought to mind the words of another great woman who lived what she believed—the French peasant girl Joan of Arc: <i>Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing, nevertheless they give up their lives to that little or nothing. One life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it’s gone. But to surrender what you are, and live without belief—that’s more terrible than dying—more terrible than dying young.</i> [Maxwell Anderson, <i>Joan of Lorraine,</i> act 2]</p>
<p>I would like to share with you some of my beliefs and feelings about the things that make a difference in my life—that which defines me. First, I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. It is of the utmost importance to me. The gospel gives us an understanding of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going. The gospel teaches us about our relationship with God. We are his spirit children, and our destiny is to return to our heavenly home if we are true and faithful to his principles and ordinances. I know that the principles and ordinances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are the strait and narrow path back to our eternal home. Jesus Christ is the firstborn of the Father and is his Only Begotten Son. He is our Elder Brother. I believe Christ has extended his grace and love to all of our Father’s children through his atoning sacrifice. Our faithfulness will determine the reach of those blessings. He loves all people on the earth, and he expects us to develop the ability to love as he loved. He is our example. I know that Heavenly Father has blessed us—all of us—with every good gift to enable us to find our way back to him.</p>
<p>I wish to list a few of the great gifts offered to us with the hope that we will all ponder how we accept these gifts in our lives. A gift that is not accepted or appreciated becomes diminished. The first gift is the gift of life. President Joseph Fielding Smith said:</p>
<p><i>There is no greater blessing that can come than the blessing of birth. One third of the hosts of heaven, because of rebellion, were denied that privilege, and hence they have no bodies of flesh and bones, that great gift of God.</i> [Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>Doctrines of Salvation</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954), 1:116]</p>
<p>What a blessing it is to live—to be alive at this time. It is a blessing to live where we live and to be who we are. Do you ever think about this and ask, “Why me? Why am I so blessed?” We are fortunate to know the purpose of our mortal lives. We are blessed to have the challenges that come to us. These trials cause us to grow. As we experience those stretching times, we are preparing to partake of the gift that the Savior so obediently and lovingly gave us—the gift of everlasting life—even eternal life if we endure to the end. We must not waste the days of our probationary time in mortality (see 2 Nephi 9:27).</p>
<p>In conjunction with the gift of life is the blessing of parenthood—the opportunity to give life. I am thankful for my parents, for the life they gave me. I am thankful for their love and nurturing throughout my life—teaching me how to live. My 80-year-old mother continues to be a wonderful role model for me. I see so many good things in her. She continues to teach me.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the sacred responsibility of being a parent. As the years have gone by, my role and responsibilities connected with parenthood have changed. But I am constantly renewed and challenged as a mother and as a grandmother. Bored—never! I love our family. I have learned so much throughout the years by being a mother. My children (that includes the grandchildren) continue to teach me.</p>
<p>I believe in marriage if at all possible. We should all seek for a marriage in the house of the Lord. That is where eternal blessings are found. I am so thankful for my eternal companion. I appreciate that which we share as parents, but even more important are those sacred thoughts and feelings we share together as husband and wife.</p>
<p>Again, it is a wonderful gift to know that we are children of God with a divine purpose. While in Hong Kong a number of years ago, my mother and I went on a tour of that beautiful city and surrounding area. The young woman tour guide became interested in us and asked about our homeland. We told her we were from the state of Utah. We also volunteered that we were Latter-day Saints and asked her if she had seen any Mormon missionaries there. She replied that she had heard of them, but she had no interest in religion or even in a Supreme Being. She then said: “I believe in only one thing, and that is myself—that is how the young generation feel in this city.” She went on to say: “We call it egoism. We believe in doing and accumulating all you can for yourself—no one else matters.”</p>
<p>Many people live their lives this way. It appears that all they care about is themselves. But I had never heard anyone admit to such a philosophy. I was surprised and realized that she was searching for a way to make her life meaningful. I thought of the scripture in Matthew 16:25–26:</p>
<p><i>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</i></p>
<p><i>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</i></p>
<p>The young lady did not understand who she is. She was not able to enjoy the gift of knowing that she is a daughter of a Heavenly Father and that her life has purpose beyond herself.</p>
<p>We are a blessed people. There are so many gifts that we share in our associations. We enjoy the gifts of love, of friendships—a warm handshake, an arm around the shoulder, a smile, a sincere greeting. We enjoy the gifts of a listening ear, of testimonies shared, and of service rendered in so many ways.</p>
<p>Do we accept that which has been extended to us with gratitude? Do we see these blessings as gifts from God—as well as gifts from those around us? Most important of all, are we good gift givers? I once heard Elder Neal A. Maxwell give this quote from G. K. Chesterton: “How much larger [our lives] would be if [we] could become smaller in it” (Gilbert K. Chesterton, “The Maniac,” <i>Orthodoxy</i> [New York: John Lane Company, 1909], pp. 34–35). God bless all of us to look outside ourselves and share our great gifts with others, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

We like the new beginnings, new routines, and new opportunities that are part of this time of year. We are glad all of you are with us. We are also happy for those who have chosen to begin their missionary service with the recent announcement made by President Monson.
COS: During general conference this past October, we were very interested in the many references, both direct and indirect, that assured us of the continued influence of heaven in our lives. We believe this is true for us individually, for us as a Church, and also for us as the BYU community. Lest any be confused or misled, I am not suggesting that our agency is compromised or limited. In fact, our agency or responsibility to make proper choices is a fundamental and inescapable doctrine of our Heavenly Father’s plan. Likewise, it is also essential we understand that in our mortal probation we are entitled to have the interventions of “the hand of the Lord” in our lives when we live so as to merit such blessings.
Usually, at least in our experience, the touch of the Lord’s hand is soft and subtle—so soft and subtle that we may not recognize it. Happily, in necessary situations our experience can be as that of Ezekiel when he said, “The hand of the Lord was strong upon me” (Ezekiel 3:14).
SGS: What is increasingly clear to us is that as we reflect on what has transpired in our lifetimes and in yours, we have been influenced more than we previously imagined by the blessings and guidance available to us in answer to our prayers. How this happens occurs in multiple ways. We believe in the scriptural assurances of the ministering of angels. We also know that the Holy Ghost has a tremendous influence in our lives when we live so that such help is appropriate. We also understand better as we get older that often the help we need is provided by our loving Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior, through other people who have been prompted to help, guide, and rescue us in times of need or consequential decision making.
COS: As President Henry B. Eyring recounted the special events that led him to surrender his tenured faculty appointment at Stanford University and took him to preside at Ricks College (see “Where Is the Pavilion?” Ensign, November 2012, 72–75), we have reflected on our own experiences. In some ways what has happened to us is very different and in other ways is exactly the same as has unfolded for others. A common characteristic in our case seems to be that we recognize the hand of the Lord much better in retrospect than while interventions are actually taking place. Another is that the Lord’s hand often is so gentle that what happens seems to be usual in the normal course of current events but later turns out to be of very great import. Likewise, when we have not been careful to acknow</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">After recovering from the shock of being invited early last November to speak at today’s devotional, my mind turned to finding a topic on which to speak. The invitation was to address a gospel topic of importance to me. The idea of gospel gifts came quickly to mind. We were entering the holiday season, a season of gratitude for gifts and blessings received as well as a season for the giving of gifts. A bit more thought reminded me that I would be speaking one day before my youngest daughter’s 15th birthday and, as we know, birthdays are also occasions for gift giving.
Subsequent pondering and prayer confirmed that my initial impression to speak about gospel gifts was appropriate. The idea of gifts permeates the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the most recent general conference of the Church, 11 of the 34 talks included the word gift or gifts. Additionally, 129 chapters or sections of the standard works make reference to gifts.
Gospel Gifts Typify Jesus Christ
So what do I mean by gospel gifts? As the Bible Dictionary in the LDS edition of the scriptures tells us, “The word gospel means good news. The good news is that Jesus Christ has made a perfect atonement for mankind” (s.v. “gospels,” 682). While preparing this talk, I read the following verse during my regular scripture study:
Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.[2 Nephi 11:4]
The phrase gospel gifts came to me weeks before I read this passage, but only upon reading it did I understand more fully. Gospel gifts are gifts that point us to or typify Jesus Christ.
Gospel Gifts May Be Given to Us By God
One of the scriptural references to gifts is found in Matthew 7:9–11, which reads:
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
In these verses, the Savior teaches us that even we imperfect mortals know how to give good gifts. That being the case, it ought to cause no wonderment in us that, in their perfection, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ also give good, even perfect, gifts. However, the 129 scriptural passages I referred to either address gifts in general or they do not make clear what specific gift is being given.
Gifts are given—indeed, the dictionary suggests that the word gift is akin to the Old English giefan, which means “to give.” Therefore, I searched for the word give and its variants in the online version of the scrip</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a privilege to stand before you at this podium today. This is not an occasion that I anticipated or aspired to, but it is indeed a privilege, and I welcome the opportunity to share my testimony of the Savior and some things I have learned about being His disciple.
On April 8, 2008, I noted, as I always do on that date, the anniversary of my appointment as a faculty member here at BYU, beginning 34 years ago on April 8, 1974. I was not among the original group of faculty hired for what was then the new J. Reuben Clark Law School, but I was the first of the “non-originals,” and now, with the passage of time, have become the longest continuously serving member of the Law School faculty. I am profoundly grateful for the many students and colleagues—both at the Law School and the university generally—who have enriched my life.
I first became a student of the law at Duke University School of Law in September 1967—nearly 41 years ago. Only four years earlier I had received my patriarchal blessing, which included the admonition “Study the laws of the temporal affairs of men as well as of their spiritual affairs.” I began teaching here at the BYU Law School less than two years after completing law studies at Duke, and when I reread this patriarchal blessing a few years ago, I realized that most of my legal career had indeed centered on the “study” of the law.
My remarks today will touch on the laws of our temporal affairs as well as on the laws of our spiritual affairs. Our scriptures contain dozens of references to both temporal and spiritual laws. The Lord declared “that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given you a law which was temporal” (D&amp;C 29:34). Joseph Smith was urged by the Lord “to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion” (D&amp;C 93:53). And to all of us the Lord commanded: “Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land” (D&amp;C 58:21). And thus we proclaim in the twelfth article of faith our commitment to “obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.”
The great prophet Lehi taught us that without the law of God there would be no sin, righteousness, happiness, punishment, or misery: “And if these things are not there is no God” (2 Nephi 2:13). Alma affirmed this by teaching:
There is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God. [Alma 42:22]
Whatever else we learn from these scriptures, we learn that one of the important godly attributes is adherence to law.
However, it is important to realize that the law is not only </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a privilege it is to speak to you, a royal generation, who were chosen before the foundation of the world to come forth at this time to do an important work. I have met many of you during my service in the Church, and I have been impressed by your brightness and goodness. I can picture you now in your gatherings all over the world, from the United States, Mexico, Brazil, and other countries in South America to the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and many European countries. I have even seen you arrive at meetings by the truckload in the Dominican Republic.
We learn in the Book of Mormon that when the rising generation—that’s you—are converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ and keep their covenants, then the future is bright for all of the Lord’s people. But when the rising generation fails to gain testimonies and take hold of their responsibilities, then the older, more faithful people begin to lose heart (see Mosiah 26:1–4; see also 1 Nephi 8:23). Thank you for your fine lives and the bright future you will bring to me and so many others.
We are here tonight primarily because we have a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Without that testimony there would be no point in going any further with a message to you. I know that you have a firm belief in our Heavenly Father and in the Savior and in latter-day prophets or you would not have made the effort to attend this meeting. When we know the restored gospel is true, we embrace all of it and not just the parts that are convenient for us. We believe in the plan of our Heavenly Father and all that the prophets and apostles have taught us. I know that as you participate tonight with an open and prayerful heart, the Spirit will convey to each of you some individualized and important teachings.
As I pondered and prayed to the Lord to learn what He would have me say to you tonight, my thoughts went often to my 79 nieces and nephews. I have walked with them, sung with them, and heard their testimonies. I love them all. I know that each one of them has desires to make a difference for good in the world and have their lives count for something. Twenty-two of those 79 nieces and nephews are single adults in your age-group. Of those 22, 11 of them are currently serving or have served missions, and others are preparing for missions. Some are preparing for marriage. Some have completed school and are searching for their place in the world. All of them have been or are currently furthering their education.
These nieces and nephews have unique gifts, and among them are those who have had experience with illness, injury, and tragedy. Knowing that in many ways my nieces and nephews are representative of you, I prepared this message with them in mind. In thinking of them, I think of you. Each of you has been, is, or will be in the same places as these nieces and nephews. I have sought inspiration as to how I could be of help to them with some of their questions, </span>
