  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Well, thank you very much, President Hinckley, university trustees, President Samuelson, Congressman Cannon, BYU faculty and staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, members of the class of 2007.

Thank you for the warm welcome to Provo, Utah - home to one of the finest universities in the United States of America. Ive enjoyed my time here today. I was pleased to meet with the First Presidency. And its always an honor to be in the company of this universitys chairman, a distinguished American and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Gordon B. Hinckley.

I count it a privilege to be a part of this ceremony. Im grateful for the honor that Ive just received - and humbled, as well. My wife, Lynne, reminded me that Im not the first in the family to have ties to Brigham Young University or to this state. Lynnes father grew up right here in Provo, and two of her great-grandparents graduated from Brigham Young Academy, which grew into this fine university.

Further back, only a year after Brigham Young arrived in this valley, Lynnes great-great-grandmother was baptized into the Mormon faith. She arrived here in a train of 50 wagons of Welsh immigrants and set to work with all the others who crossed the Mormon Trail to make the desert bloom. My wife has done a lot of research, and shes very proud of her Utah heritage. And, as of today, she has a higher opinion of me, too - now that I have an honorary degree from Brigham Young University.

But this day belongs to the fine young men and women whove actually earned their degrees. And Im delighted to share the occasion with you, and I bring congratulations and good wishes from the president of the United States, George W. Bush.

Ive had the experience of seeing my own children collect college and graduate diplomas and begin a new journey. Its an experience like no other. And so, as a tribute, I think we should have a round of applause for all the moms and dads here today as well.

Graduation always produces a mix of emotions. Theres a sense of pride at having set a high goal and reaching it. Theres also a little bit of sadness at leaving a place you love and feeling as though a curtain is falling on a very special time in your life. But there is also a great spirit to BYU, and this university will always be part of you. We had a glimpse of the character of BYU again last Friday, when this campus held a candlelight vigil to remember the victims of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. More than a place of learning, BYU is a community of faith and kindness and compassion.

As you leave your alma mater, youll carry many fond memories of your years on this campus. Youll recall the long hours of hard work in the library and the lab, the sound of the national anthem in the morning and evening, and the teachers and the friends who have enriched your life.

Youll remember those places you call the Hfack, the Swickitt, the Wilk, and the Marb. Im told you probably wont miss your visits to the Testing Center or your dealings with the Traffic Office. But youll remember that every year youve been at BYU the school has been ranked number one in the category of Stone Cold Sober. And youll remember, of course, the Cougar basketball team beating Utah your senior year and the day in the football stadium when you saw Jonny Harlines answered prayer.

Above all, youll carry the distinction of earning a degree from BYU - a place with impressive alumni throughout this nation and far beyond. The values of this school have been a guide to generations. BYU alumni are men and women at home in the world - working and achieving and reflecting great credit on this university and on the LDS Church.

I also want to note that BYU has a lengthy tradition of military honor and service. And this week members of the ROTC in the class of 2007 receive their military commissions, and I want to thank all of them, on behalf of all of us, for the commitment theyve made. They join the ranks of a great force for justice, freedom, and security - and were proud of their brave service to the United States of America.

In addition to those of you receiving your bachelors degrees this afternoon, Im told we have many men and women who have earned graduate degrees, including a number whove earned their PhDs. Their presence here reminds me that I was once in a PhD program myself and met all the requirements - except for the dissertation. Ill get started as soon as I come up with a topic.

After putting in these years of hard effort as students at BYU, something tells me youre probably not up for another lecture before you leave, so Im going to keep this short. I know that its the custom for graduation speakers to draw from their experiences to share some of the lessons theyve learned along the way. So as you begin this new chapter in life, let me offer a few thoughts of my own. There is one very practical lesson that comes immediately to mind. It goes back to the year 2000, when then Governor Bush called to ask if I would help him find a running mate for vice president. The lesson I want to share with you is this: If you ever get asked to head up an important search committee, say yes.

That decision seven years ago set me on a path I was not expecting to take. I believed that my time in public office had passed. And my career in politics itself was an unplanned enterprise. On the day of my own graduation from the University of Wyoming, I had no ambitions of holding higher office. If youd asked me at the time what I planned on doing, I could have described in some detail what the next 10 years would be like. First would be graduate school, then wrapping up that PhD, and, down the road, with luck, a faculty position at a university. It all worked out very differently. Within a few years Lynne and I were living in Washington, D.C., and beginning a journey in government and public life that neither of us had ever imagined.

Many of you will leave BYU today with definite plans of your own. And setting a plan for your life can be a good thing. It keeps you focused on the future and gives you a standard for measuring your progress. Yet I would guess that 10 years from now many of you will find yourselves following a very different course - all because of an opportunity that came out of the blue.

Be on the watch for those certain moments and certain people that come along and point you in a new direction. I think, for example, of the first time I met my friend Don Rumsfeld. It was back in the 1960s, when he was a congressman and I was interviewing for a fellowship on Capitol Hill. Congressman Rumsfeld agreed to talk to me, but things didnt go all that smoothly. In fact, he pretty much threw me out of his office. Dons impression of me was that I was kind of a detached, theoretical, impractical academic type. And I thought he was a brash young politician with a cocky attitude. And we were both right.

We didnt click that day, but later on it was Don Rumsfeld who noticed my work and offered me a position in the executive branch. Later on, when Gerald Ford became president and made Rumsfeld his chief of staff, it was once again Don who gave me a position of great responsibility in the White House. Standing here today, I can promise that there will be people like this in your own life who keep an eye on you and reward your efforts and help bring out your strengths. Sometimes others know better than we do just what our talents are and how we can make good use of them. For all the plans we make in life, sometimes life has other plans for us.

Those of us whove been around a while can also recall a few times when life took an unexpected turn, and not always in a positive direction. As I mentioned a moment ago, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Wyoming. My college experience, though, began at a place called Yale - but I didnt finish there. Instead, I dropped out after a few semesters. Well, actually, "dropped out" isnt quite accurate. "Was asked to leave" would be more like it. Twice. The second time around they said, "Dont come back."

You, too, may face some disappointing turns of your own - times when you fall short, knowing you could have done better. And when that happens, dont give up or let your doubts get the best of you. I have met some very successful people in my day, men and women of talent and character who have risen to the very top of their fields. And its the rare one who hasnt had a taste of failure or a false start along the way. Setbacks in life can stop you dead in your tracks or they can inspire you forward. Either way, youll look back on them as turning points. They are crucial days in your life when you see the starkest kind of choice and know that it belongs to you alone.

One of the things I love most about our country is that we have such opportunities. America is still the country of a second chance. Most of us end up needing one. And when weve gone on to accomplish something, we can be that much more grateful.

And gratitude, in general, is a good habit to get into. It is usually a correct appraisal of our situation. Most of us are able to succeed and to rise in the world because someone helped out along the way - whether it was a memorable teacher or a boss who handed us a great opportunity or the person who took a chance and gave us the first big break in our career. A grateful heart is an honest understanding of all that we have been given and all that is expected in return.

There is always the temptation to forget this, to carry ourselves with an air of entitlement as if good things come to us by right. They rarely do. And life has a way of working out better when we dont take things for granted, when we have a long memory for what others have given us, when we look for the blessings, great and small, that come with every day were alive on this earth.

For all of you, this day in the Marriott Center will forever stand out as a marker of gifts well used and hard work rewarded. It has been my privilege to share it with you and your families. I congratulate you. I hope your future is filled with the kind of happiness you feel today. And, again, I thank the university for this honorary degree. I leave here as a proud member of the Brigham Young University Class of 2007.

			<p>Well, thank you very much, President Hinckley, university trustees, President Samuelson, Congressman Cannon, BYU faculty and staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, members of the class of 2007.</p>
<p>Thank you for the warm welcome to Provo, Utah - home to one of the finest universities in the United States of America. Ive enjoyed my time here today. I was pleased to meet with the First Presidency. And its always an honor to be in the company of this universitys chairman, a distinguished American and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>
<p>I count it a privilege to be a part of this ceremony. Im grateful for the honor that Ive just received - and humbled, as well. My wife, Lynne, reminded me that Im not the first in the family to have ties to Brigham Young University or to this state. Lynnes father grew up right here in Provo, and two of her great-grandparents graduated from Brigham Young Academy, which grew into this fine university.</p>
<p>Further back, only a year after Brigham Young arrived in this valley, Lynnes great-great-grandmother was baptized into the Mormon faith. She arrived here in a train of 50 wagons of Welsh immigrants and set to work with all the others who crossed the Mormon Trail to make the desert bloom. My wife has done a lot of research, and shes very proud of her Utah heritage. And, as of today, she has a higher opinion of me, too - now that I have an honorary degree from Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>But this day belongs to the fine young men and women whove actually earned their degrees. And Im delighted to share the occasion with you, and I bring congratulations and good wishes from the president of the United States, George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Ive had the experience of seeing my own children collect college and graduate diplomas and begin a new journey. Its an experience like no other. And so, as a tribute, I think we should have a round of applause for all the moms and dads here today as well.</p>
<p>Graduation always produces a mix of emotions. Theres a sense of pride at having set a high goal and reaching it. Theres also a little bit of sadness at leaving a place you love and feeling as though a curtain is falling on a very special time in your life. But there is also a great spirit to BYU, and this university will always be part of you. We had a glimpse of the character of BYU again last Friday, when this campus held a candlelight vigil to remember the victims of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. More than a place of learning, BYU is a community of faith and kindness and compassion.</p>
<p>As you leave your alma mater, youll carry many fond memories of your years on this campus. Youll recall the long hours of hard work in the library and the lab, the sound of the national anthem in the morning and evening, and the teachers and the friends who have enriched your life.</p>
<p>Youll remember those places you call the Hfack, the Swickitt, the Wilk, and the Marb. Im told you probably wont miss your visits to the Testing Center or your dealings with the Traffic Office. But youll remember that every year youve been at BYU the school has been ranked number one in the category of Stone Cold Sober. And youll remember, of course, the Cougar basketball team beating Utah your senior year and the day in the football stadium when you saw Jonny Harlines answered prayer.</p>
<p>Above all, youll carry the distinction of earning a degree from BYU - a place with impressive alumni throughout this nation and far beyond. The values of this school have been a guide to generations. BYU alumni are men and women at home in the world - working and achieving and reflecting great credit on this university and on the LDS Church.</p>
<p>I also want to note that BYU has a lengthy tradition of military honor and service. And this week members of the ROTC in the class of 2007 receive their military commissions, and I want to thank all of them, on behalf of all of us, for the commitment theyve made. They join the ranks of a great force for justice, freedom, and security - and were proud of their brave service to the United States of America.</p>
<p>In addition to those of you receiving your bachelors degrees this afternoon, Im told we have many men and women who have earned graduate degrees, including a number whove earned their PhDs. Their presence here reminds me that I was once in a PhD program myself and met all the requirements - except for the dissertation. Ill get started as soon as I come up with a topic.</p>
<p>After putting in these years of hard effort as students at BYU, something tells me youre probably not up for another lecture before you leave, so Im going to keep this short. I know that its the custom for graduation speakers to draw from their experiences to share some of the lessons theyve learned along the way. So as you begin this new chapter in life, let me offer a few thoughts of my own. There is one very practical lesson that comes immediately to mind. It goes back to the year 2000, when then Governor Bush called to ask if I would help him find a running mate for vice president. The lesson I want to share with you is this: If you ever get asked to head up an important search committee, say yes.</p>
<p>That decision seven years ago set me on a path I was not expecting to take. I believed that my time in public office had passed. And my career in politics itself was an unplanned enterprise. On the day of my own graduation from the University of Wyoming, I had no ambitions of holding higher office. If youd asked me at the time what I planned on doing, I could have described in some detail what the next 10 years would be like. First would be graduate school, then wrapping up that PhD, and, down the road, with luck, a faculty position at a university. It all worked out very differently. Within a few years Lynne and I were living in Washington, D.C., and beginning a journey in government and public life that neither of us had ever imagined.</p>
<p>Many of you will leave BYU today with definite plans of your own. And setting a plan for your life can be a good thing. It keeps you focused on the future and gives you a standard for measuring your progress. Yet I would guess that 10 years from now many of you will find yourselves following a very different course - all because of an opportunity that came out of the blue.</p>
<p>Be on the watch for those certain moments and certain people that come along and point you in a new direction. I think, for example, of the first time I met my friend Don Rumsfeld. It was back in the 1960s, when he was a congressman and I was interviewing for a fellowship on Capitol Hill. Congressman Rumsfeld agreed to talk to me, but things didnt go all that smoothly. In fact, he pretty much threw me out of his office. Dons impression of me was that I was kind of a detached, theoretical, impractical academic type. And I thought he was a brash young politician with a cocky attitude. And we were both right.</p>
<p>We didnt click that day, but later on it was Don Rumsfeld who noticed my work and offered me a position in the executive branch. Later on, when Gerald Ford became president and made Rumsfeld his chief of staff, it was once again Don who gave me a position of great responsibility in the White House. Standing here today, I can promise that there will be people like this in your own life who keep an eye on you and reward your efforts and help bring out your strengths. Sometimes others know better than we do just what our talents are and how we can make good use of them. For all the plans we make in life, sometimes life has other plans for us.</p>
<p>Those of us whove been around a while can also recall a few times when life took an unexpected turn, and not always in a positive direction. As I mentioned a moment ago, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Wyoming. My college experience, though, began at a place called Yale - but I didnt finish there. Instead, I dropped out after a few semesters. Well, actually, "dropped out" isnt quite accurate. "Was asked to leave" would be more like it. Twice. The second time around they said, "Dont come back."</p>
<p>You, too, may face some disappointing turns of your own - times when you fall short, knowing you could have done better. And when that happens, dont give up or let your doubts get the best of you. I have met some very successful people in my day, men and women of talent and character who have risen to the very top of their fields. And its the rare one who hasnt had a taste of failure or a false start along the way. Setbacks in life can stop you dead in your tracks or they can inspire you forward. Either way, youll look back on them as turning points. They are crucial days in your life when you see the starkest kind of choice and know that it belongs to you alone.</p>
<p>One of the things I love most about our country is that we have such opportunities. America is still the country of a second chance. Most of us end up needing one. And when weve gone on to accomplish something, we can be that much more grateful.</p>
<p>And gratitude, in general, is a good habit to get into. It is usually a correct appraisal of our situation. Most of us are able to succeed and to rise in the world because someone helped out along the way - whether it was a memorable teacher or a boss who handed us a great opportunity or the person who took a chance and gave us the first big break in our career. A grateful heart is an honest understanding of all that we have been given and all that is expected in return.</p>
<p>There is always the temptation to forget this, to carry ourselves with an air of entitlement as if good things come to us by right. They rarely do. And life has a way of working out better when we dont take things for granted, when we have a long memory for what others have given us, when we look for the blessings, great and small, that come with every day were alive on this earth.</p>
<p>For all of you, this day in the Marriott Center will forever stand out as a marker of gifts well used and hard work rewarded. It has been my privilege to share it with you and your families. I congratulate you. I hope your future is filled with the kind of happiness you feel today. And, again, I thank the university for this honorary degree. I leave here as a proud member of the Brigham Young University Class of 2007.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question "What lack I yet?" and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, "Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer."
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to "be more cheerful" or to "smile more often" or to "count their blessings."
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happiness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing "an unconscious smile."1 I have known people like that - individuals who are continually smiling without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being "temple worthy," what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day - and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet - and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to "thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was "My Heavenly Father Loves Me" (Childrens Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song - "hear[ing] the song of a bird," "look[ing] at the blue . . . sky," having eyes to "see The color of butterfly wings," and feeling "the wind as it rushes by." Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, "What is a SWKT?" I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges - including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. ["Stories of the Century," comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 19992000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lees memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the students tuition. . . .

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn "Count Your Blessings." I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; evry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact - not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: "I can live for two months on a good compliment."3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift - from friends, from family, from God - and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change peoples lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles - 500 of it on foot. Im not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I dont believe Ive ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lords hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries - our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease - we sometimes forget to confess the Lords hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimballs statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Lets take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
