  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="With Christmas only a fortnight away, thoughts turn to our homes and families. Sister Nelson and I enjoy many Christmas traditions. On our mantle over the fireplace we display a small framed photograph of each member of the family. With 10 children, their spouses, and 54 grandchildren, thats quite a flock of photos. We have been doing this for so long that most of the pictures are no longer current. The children scramble to find their own pictures among the many.

They also admire Sister Nelsons large assortment of dolls collected from various countries throughout the world. Those dolls are nestled among the branches of our Christmas tree. Her cookies, cakes, and candies are always in great demand. And we love to read scriptures of the Christmas story with our family.

Through all of our various Christmas traditions, I hope that we are focused first upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men still adore Him. At this special devotional, many of you have come with a prayer in your hearts that you may learn from one of the Twelve Apostles more about our Lord and Master.

We commemorate His humble birth at this time of year, even though we know it did not occur in December but more likely in April. Scriptures declare that His mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph. They had participated in the first of two components of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Their espousal might be likened to an engagement in our culture, which is followed later by the second component of a marriage ceremony.

Lukes account records the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mary when she first learned of her favored future. I read from chapter 1:

"Hail, thou that art highly favoured . . . : blessed art thou among women. . . .

"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.

"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Note the capital S; capital H.)

God is the Highest. Jesus was to be the Son of the Highest.

"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

She knew of her virginal status.

"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Before Joseph and Mary came together, she was expecting that holy child. Joseph desired to protect her privacy,&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; hoping to spare Mary the punishment given to a woman pregnant without a completed marriage. While he pondered these things, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph, saying,

"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

Mary and Joseph did not need to be taught the deep significance of the name &lt;i&gt;Jesus.&lt;/i&gt; The Hebrew root from which it was derived, &lt;i&gt;Jehoshua,&lt;/i&gt; means "Jehovah is salvation." So the mission of Jehovah, soon to be named Jesus, was salvation, and His supreme destiny was to become the Savior of the world.

Lets turn to the Book of Mormon for the dialogue that Nephi had with an angel as recorded in 1 Nephi 11:

The angel asked: "Knowest thou the condescension of God?"&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Nephi replied: "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.

"And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.

". . . I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!

"And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.

"And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!"&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Now lets turn to the second chapter of Luke - the fond and familiar story that we read at Christmastime:

"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

This was really a capitation tax, a census, an enrollment - a registration of the citizenry of the empire of Rome. Herod made a decision that people should be counted in the land of their ancestors. Mary and Joseph, then living in Nazareth, had to travel southward to the city of David, a distance approximately as far as from Salt Lake City to Nephi. Perhaps they traveled even farther if they went around the hostile intermediate province of Samaria. Almost certainly they traveled with relatives who likewise were summoned to the land of their ancestry. This difficult travel was no doubt made with their animals, such as dogs and donkeys. They likely camped out several nights, as three to four days would have been required for that journey.

Verse 7: "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

Lets pause to ponder this verse. We need to be aware of the culture of that time and region, and we need to learn one word from the original Greek text. In the Greek New Testament, the root from which &lt;i&gt;inn&lt;/i&gt; was translated is &lt;i&gt;kataluma. &lt;/i&gt;We dont have an equivalent word in the English language. The Greek prefix &lt;i&gt;kata-&lt;/i&gt;(or &lt;i&gt;cata-&lt;/i&gt;) means "a bringing down." We see it in English words such as &lt;i&gt;cata&lt;/i&gt;bolism, &lt;i&gt;cata&lt;/i&gt;strophe, and &lt;i&gt;cata&lt;/i&gt;clysm. When the prefix &lt;i&gt;kata-&lt;/i&gt; was joined with the suffix &lt;i&gt;-luma,&lt;/i&gt; it meant literally "a breaking down of a journey." A kataluma was a guest chamber in a lodging place.

In those days an inn was not like a Holiday Inn or a Bethlehem Marriott. A lodging place in that part of Asia had to provide accommodations for traveling caravans, including the people and their animals. Caravans stayed at what was then known (and is still known) as a &lt;i&gt;caravansary,&lt;/i&gt; or a &lt;i&gt;khan.&lt;/i&gt; You may look in your own dictionary and find &lt;i&gt;caravansary&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;khan,&lt;/i&gt; each defined as a rest house in some Asian countries.

Such a facility is typically rectangular in shape. It has a central courtyard for the animals that is surrounded by walled cubicles where the people rest. These quarters allowed guests to be elevated slightly above their animals with open doorways so that owners could watch over their animals.

The Joseph Smith Translation of Luke 2:7 indicates that there was no room for them in the "inns," suggesting that all of the katalumas or cubicles of the caravansary were occupied. In the Greek New Testament the word &lt;i&gt;kataluma &lt;/i&gt;appears in only two other passages,&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; translated in each instance not as "inn" but as a "guestchamber," which fits the concept that we have discussed.

As a youngster, whenever I heard those words "no room in the inn," I assumed that No Vacancy signs were posted at local motels or that the innkeepers were inhospitable or even hostile. Such an assumption is probably way off the mark. People of that part of the world were no doubt then as they are now - most hospitable. Particularly would this have been true at a season when the normal population of Jerusalem and neighboring Bethlehem would be swollen with large numbers of relatives.

At a caravansary, animals were secured for the night in the center courtyard. In that courtyard there would have been donkeys and dogs, sheep, and possibly camels and oxen, along with all of the animals discharges and odors. Because the guest chambers surrounding the courtyard were filled, Joseph possibly made the decision to care for Marys delivery in the center courtyard of a caravansary - among the animals. There, in that lowly circumstance, the Lamb of God was born.

Why was reference made twice in Luke 2 to His being wrapped in swaddling clothes?&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; What is the meaning of those five words "wrapped him in swaddling clothes"? I sense a significance beyond the use of an ordinary diaper and receiving blanket. Instead of those five words in the English text, only one word is needed in the Greek New Testament. That word is &lt;i&gt;sparganoo,&lt;/i&gt; which means to envelop a newborn child with special cloth, strips of which were passed from side to side.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; The cloth would probably bear unique family identification. That procedure was especially applicable to the birth of a firstborn son.

You remember the announcement of an angel at the birth of Jesus:

"This shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; His wrappings surely would have been distinctive.

I think that such a concept of a cloth with family markings might also have been relevant when Joseph, son of Israel, became the birthright son and received the unique cloth coat of many colors - a fabric symbolic of the birthright.

What about the manger? Those of you who speak French will recognize the word to be the same as the French word &lt;i&gt;manger,&lt;/i&gt; meaning "to eat." A manger is a trough or an open box in a stable designed to hold feed, provender, or fodder for animals to eat. Elevated from the floor of the contaminated courtyard, a manger was probably the cleanest site available. Such a feeding trough became the cradle for our Lord!

Now, two millennia later, though we dont know all the details pertaining to His birth, we certainly understand the unique parentage of this Babe of Bethlehem. Several scriptures ask the question "Who shall declare His generation?"&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; We declare solemnly and with conviction: Jesus was born of an immortal Father and a mortal mother. From His immortal Father, Jesus inherited the power to live forever. From His mortal mother He inherited the fate of physical death.

He declared this reality regarding His own life: "No man taketh it from me," He said, "but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;

Those unique attributes were essential for His mission to atone for the sins of all mankind. Thus Jesus the Christ was born to die.&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; He died that we might live. He was born that all humankind could live beyond the grave.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; His Atonement was wrought in Gethsemane - where He sweat great drops of blood - and on Golgotha (or Calvary) - where His body was lifted up upon a cross above the place of the skull, which signified death. This infinite Atonement would release man from the infinitude of death.&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; His Atonement made the Resurrection a reality and the gift of eternal life a possibility for all who would obey His teachings. His Atonement became the central act of all human history.

Our recollections of Christmas are enriched by these realities. Each one of us with a testimony of the Lord has the privilege in faith to know of His divine parentage and to testify that Jesus is the Son of the living God.

True testimony includes the fact that the Father and the Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith, whose birth we commemorate on December 23. That testimony includes the fact that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, led by the living Lord via prophecy and revelation through authorized administrators who receive and respond to direction from Him.

With this background in mind, I share comforting counsel with you today. It comes from section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where we read this commandment from our Master: "Be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come."&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;

Lovingly we cling to that promise. Difficult days are ahead for all mankind. Sin is on the increase. We live in a time of wars and rumors of wars. The Church and its members will come under attack and endure persecution.&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

Jesus descended below all things in order to rise above all things. He expects us to follow His example. Yoked with Him, we can rise above all challenges, no matter how difficult they may be.&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Peter offered this counsel:"If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

The time is coming when those who do &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;obey the Lord will be separated from those who &lt;i&gt;do.&lt;/i&gt; Our safest insurance is to continue to be worthy of admission to His holy house. How blessed we are to have temples available. The greatest gift you could give to the Lord at this or any other time of year is to keep yourself unspotted from the world, worthy to attend His holy house. His gift to you will be the peace and security of knowing that you are worthy to meet Him, whenever that time shall come.

Brothers and sisters, I plead with you to rise above the tasks of the day and the hurdles ahead. You can do more than the deeds scheduled in your daily planners. You can take the name of the Lord upon you and become more like Him. You can rise to your great potential. You can prepare for the future with greater spiritual capacity.

Remember that the fulness of Christs ministry lies in the future. The prophecies of His Second Coming have yet to be fulfilled. At Christmas, of course, we focus upon His birth. But, He will come again. At His First Coming Jesus came almost in secret. Only a few mortals knew of His birth. At His Second Coming the whole of humankind will know of His return. Then He will come, not as "a man traveling on the earth,"&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; but His glory "shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together."&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;

As a special witness of His holy name, I testify that Jesus is the divine Son of the living God. He will love you, lift you, and manifest Himself unto you if you will love Him and keep His commandments.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;

I express my love and blessing for each of you, along with my best wishes for a very merry Christmas, and do so prayerfully in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>With Christmas only a fortnight away, thoughts turn to our homes and families. Sister Nelson and I enjoy many Christmas traditions. On our mantle over the fireplace we display a small framed photograph of each member of the family. With 10 children, their spouses, and 54 grandchildren, thats quite a flock of photos. We have been doing this for so long that most of the pictures are no longer current. The children scramble to find their own pictures among the many.</p>
<p>They also admire Sister Nelsons large assortment of dolls collected from various countries throughout the world. Those dolls are nestled among the branches of our Christmas tree. Her cookies, cakes, and candies are always in great demand. And we love to read scriptures of the Christmas story with our family.</p>
<p>Through all of our various Christmas traditions, I hope that we are focused first upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men still adore Him. At this special devotional, many of you have come with a prayer in your hearts that you may learn from one of the Twelve Apostles more about our Lord and Master.</p>
<p>We commemorate His humble birth at this time of year, even though we know it did not occur in December but more likely in April. Scriptures declare that His mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph. They had participated in the first of two components of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Their espousal might be likened to an engagement in our culture, which is followed later by the second component of a marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>Lukes account records the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mary when she first learned of her favored future. I read from chapter 1:</p>
<p>"Hail, thou that art highly favoured . . . : blessed art thou among women. . . .</p>
<p>"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p>
<p>"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</p>
<p>"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest."<sup>1</sup> (Note the capital S; capital H.)</p>
<p>God is the Highest. Jesus was to be the Son of the Highest.</p>
<p>"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>She knew of her virginal status.</p>
<p>"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Before Joseph and Mary came together, she was expecting that holy child. Joseph desired to protect her privacy,<sup>4</sup> hoping to spare Mary the punishment given to a woman pregnant without a completed marriage. While he pondered these things, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph, saying,</p>
<p>"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Mary and Joseph did not need to be taught the deep significance of the name <i>Jesus.</i> The Hebrew root from which it was derived, <i>Jehoshua,</i> means "Jehovah is salvation." So the mission of Jehovah, soon to be named Jesus, was salvation, and His supreme destiny was to become the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>Lets turn to the Book of Mormon for the dialogue that Nephi had with an angel as recorded in 1 Nephi 11:</p>
<p>The angel asked: "Knowest thou the condescension of God?"<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Nephi replied: "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.</p>
<p>"And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</p>
<p>". . . I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</p>
<p>"And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.</p>
<p>"And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!"<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Now lets turn to the second chapter of Luke - the fond and familiar story that we read at Christmastime:</p>
<p>"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>This was really a capitation tax, a census, an enrollment - a registration of the citizenry of the empire of Rome. Herod made a decision that people should be counted in the land of their ancestors. Mary and Joseph, then living in Nazareth, had to travel southward to the city of David, a distance approximately as far as from Salt Lake City to Nephi. Perhaps they traveled even farther if they went around the hostile intermediate province of Samaria. Almost certainly they traveled with relatives who likewise were summoned to the land of their ancestry. This difficult travel was no doubt made with their animals, such as dogs and donkeys. They likely camped out several nights, as three to four days would have been required for that journey.</p>
<p>Verse 7: "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Lets pause to ponder this verse. We need to be aware of the culture of that time and region, and we need to learn one word from the original Greek text. In the Greek New Testament, the root from which <i>inn</i> was translated is <i>kataluma. </i>We dont have an equivalent word in the English language. The Greek prefix <i>kata-</i>(or <i>cata-</i>) means "a bringing down." We see it in English words such as <i>cata</i>bolism, <i>cata</i>strophe, and <i>cata</i>clysm. When the prefix <i>kata-</i> was joined with the suffix <i>-luma,</i> it meant literally "a breaking down of a journey." A kataluma was a guest chamber in a lodging place.</p>
<p>In those days an inn was not like a Holiday Inn or a Bethlehem Marriott. A lodging place in that part of Asia had to provide accommodations for traveling caravans, including the people and their animals. Caravans stayed at what was then known (and is still known) as a <i>caravansary,</i> or a <i>khan.</i> You may look in your own dictionary and find <i>caravansary</i> and <i>khan,</i> each defined as a rest house in some Asian countries.</p>
<p>Such a facility is typically rectangular in shape. It has a central courtyard for the animals that is surrounded by walled cubicles where the people rest. These quarters allowed guests to be elevated slightly above their animals with open doorways so that owners could watch over their animals.</p>
<p>The Joseph Smith Translation of Luke 2:7 indicates that there was no room for them in the "inns," suggesting that all of the katalumas or cubicles of the caravansary were occupied. In the Greek New Testament the word <i>kataluma </i>appears in only two other passages,<sup>10</sup> translated in each instance not as "inn" but as a "guestchamber," which fits the concept that we have discussed.</p>
<p>As a youngster, whenever I heard those words "no room in the inn," I assumed that No Vacancy signs were posted at local motels or that the innkeepers were inhospitable or even hostile. Such an assumption is probably way off the mark. People of that part of the world were no doubt then as they are now - most hospitable. Particularly would this have been true at a season when the normal population of Jerusalem and neighboring Bethlehem would be swollen with large numbers of relatives.</p>
<p>At a caravansary, animals were secured for the night in the center courtyard. In that courtyard there would have been donkeys and dogs, sheep, and possibly camels and oxen, along with all of the animals discharges and odors. Because the guest chambers surrounding the courtyard were filled, Joseph possibly made the decision to care for Marys delivery in the center courtyard of a caravansary - among the animals. There, in that lowly circumstance, the Lamb of God was born.</p>
<p>Why was reference made twice in Luke 2 to His being wrapped in swaddling clothes?<sup>11</sup> What is the meaning of those five words "wrapped him in swaddling clothes"? I sense a significance beyond the use of an ordinary diaper and receiving blanket. Instead of those five words in the English text, only one word is needed in the Greek New Testament. That word is <i>sparganoo,</i> which means to envelop a newborn child with special cloth, strips of which were passed from side to side.<sup>12</sup> The cloth would probably bear unique family identification. That procedure was especially applicable to the birth of a firstborn son.</p>
<p>You remember the announcement of an angel at the birth of Jesus:</p>
<p>"This shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."<sup>13</sup> His wrappings surely would have been distinctive.</p>
<p>I think that such a concept of a cloth with family markings might also have been relevant when Joseph, son of Israel, became the birthright son and received the unique cloth coat of many colors - a fabric symbolic of the birthright.</p>
<p>What about the manger? Those of you who speak French will recognize the word to be the same as the French word <i>manger,</i> meaning "to eat." A manger is a trough or an open box in a stable designed to hold feed, provender, or fodder for animals to eat. Elevated from the floor of the contaminated courtyard, a manger was probably the cleanest site available. Such a feeding trough became the cradle for our Lord!</p>
<p>Now, two millennia later, though we dont know all the details pertaining to His birth, we certainly understand the unique parentage of this Babe of Bethlehem. Several scriptures ask the question "Who shall declare His generation?"<sup>14</sup> We declare solemnly and with conviction: Jesus was born of an immortal Father and a mortal mother. From His immortal Father, Jesus inherited the power to live forever. From His mortal mother He inherited the fate of physical death.</p>
<p>He declared this reality regarding His own life: "No man taketh it from me," He said, "but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Those unique attributes were essential for His mission to atone for the sins of all mankind. Thus Jesus the Christ was born to die.<sup>16</sup> He died that we might live. He was born that all humankind could live beyond the grave.<sup>17</sup> His Atonement was wrought in Gethsemane - where He sweat great drops of blood - and on Golgotha (or Calvary) - where His body was lifted up upon a cross above the place of the skull, which signified death. This infinite Atonement would release man from the infinitude of death.<sup>18</sup> His Atonement made the Resurrection a reality and the gift of eternal life a possibility for all who would obey His teachings. His Atonement became the central act of all human history.</p>
<p>Our recollections of Christmas are enriched by these realities. Each one of us with a testimony of the Lord has the privilege in faith to know of His divine parentage and to testify that Jesus is the Son of the living God.</p>
<p>True testimony includes the fact that the Father and the Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith, whose birth we commemorate on December 23. That testimony includes the fact that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, led by the living Lord via prophecy and revelation through authorized administrators who receive and respond to direction from Him.</p>
<p>With this background in mind, I share comforting counsel with you today. It comes from section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where we read this commandment from our Master: "Be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come."<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Lovingly we cling to that promise. Difficult days are ahead for all mankind. Sin is on the increase. We live in a time of wars and rumors of wars. The Church and its members will come under attack and endure persecution.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Jesus descended below all things in order to rise above all things. He expects us to follow His example. Yoked with Him, we can rise above all challenges, no matter how difficult they may be.<sup>21</sup> Peter offered this counsel:"If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>The time is coming when those who do <i>not </i>obey the Lord will be separated from those who <i>do.</i> Our safest insurance is to continue to be worthy of admission to His holy house. How blessed we are to have temples available. The greatest gift you could give to the Lord at this or any other time of year is to keep yourself unspotted from the world, worthy to attend His holy house. His gift to you will be the peace and security of knowing that you are worthy to meet Him, whenever that time shall come.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I plead with you to rise above the tasks of the day and the hurdles ahead. You can do more than the deeds scheduled in your daily planners. You can take the name of the Lord upon you and become more like Him. You can rise to your great potential. You can prepare for the future with greater spiritual capacity.</p>
<p>Remember that the fulness of Christs ministry lies in the future. The prophecies of His Second Coming have yet to be fulfilled. At Christmas, of course, we focus upon His birth. But, He will come again. At His First Coming Jesus came almost in secret. Only a few mortals knew of His birth. At His Second Coming the whole of humankind will know of His return. Then He will come, not as "a man traveling on the earth,"<sup>23</sup> but His glory "shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together."<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>As a special witness of His holy name, I testify that Jesus is the divine Son of the living God. He will love you, lift you, and manifest Himself unto you if you will love Him and keep His commandments.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>I express my love and blessing for each of you, along with my best wishes for a very merry Christmas, and do so prayerfully in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful to be with you on this cold December morning. I pray that the warmth of the Spirit will bless us that we might be edified during our few moments together.
Today I want to talk with you about the greatest story ever told - and one of its less obvious but most important themes. You could probably recite much of this story by heart. It occupies little more than a page of scripture. It begins with the familiar duty of paying taxes. It continues with a journey that was not unusual for the time. The plot thickens when no room can be found "in the inns";1 it culminates when the Son of God is born of Mary, "a precious and chosen" virgin.2
We know little about the real people and few details regarding the true events. And yet, no matter how many times we read the story of the first Christmas, there always seems to be something new we can learn from it. That is because, as prophets have taught, "the word of God is quick," or living.3 It takes on fresh and deeper meaning whenever we are spiritually ready to receive it.
Something that stands out to me in the account of the Saviors birth is that on four separate occasions an angel appeared with the message "Fear not."
When the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias with news that his wife would bear a son, the forerunner of the Messiah, he said, "Fear not, . . . for thy prayer is heard."4
Later the same angel visited "beautiful and fair"5 Mary to tell her that she would be the mother of the Son of God, assuring her with similar words: "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."6
Shortly thereafter an angel appeared to Joseph the carpenter in a dream and said, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife."7
And then, on that holy night, as all eternity watched in reverent silence, the angel came upon humble shepherds keeping watch over their flock. The shepherds, who "were sore afraid,"8 heard the angel proclaim, "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."9
So much of what happened during those pivotal moments in the nativity narrative depended upon the courage of people like Zacharias, Mary, Joseph, and the shepherds. God had a monumental task for each of them; their lives were about to change forever. Imagine if they had let fear overcome them. What if they had pulled back, doubted, and failed to do what God needed them to do?
This less obvious theme from the account of the first Christmas intrigues me because I, like you, have fears, and I need to be reminded at times to fear not. I dont know what your fears are. Like Zacharias, who feared that he would never have children, you may have fears about your family. Or maybe your fear isnt that you wont have children but that you will have children, whom you will have to r</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In conclusion, brothers and sisters - the Plausible Evasion Research Institute, an institute I made up, has found that "in conclusion" is the most welcome phrase for most audiences, after "there will be refreshments after this meeting." So, in conclusion, I love Christmas and I love BYU devotionals. I am grateful to be with you, and my older siblings, graduates of BYU, are here, having traveled from Arizona and Idaho. They must have thought I was graduating today. Im not saying my older siblings are old, but there were no history classes on campus when they attended, just current events. The deodorant Old Spice was then known as New Spice, and the Dead Sea was just mildly sick.
Since my academic focus is education law, and since much of that discipline and practice is focused on protecting the rights and persons of children, Id like to discuss what it means in the perfect economy of the Lords kingdom to become as a little child. I believe Christmas and the birth of the Christ child help us explore this concept.
Becoming as a Little Child
When our Heavenly Father wanted to save the world, He didnt take over a country or develop a militia. He sent a helpless child to a choice and worthy woman and a humble and believing man living in insecure circumstances in a conquered land occupied by a hostile force. The harsh geopolitical and military circumstances of Christs birth should remind us that Heavenly Father can bless us even if the external circumstances of our lives arent necessarily easy or peaceful.
Herod the Great ruled over that land, under Romes ultimate control. He was mighty and built magnificent monuments - at least one of which overshadowed the land when Christ was born, being visible in all directions for miles. We cant help but contrast Herods mighty palace with the stable. If we knew for sure where the stable was, wouldnt we wish to visit the site of that sacred birth? But who cares as much about anything Herod built, besides perhaps one or two of our learned faculty members? Most of us with a normal threshold for boredom ignore Herod.
Christ is infinitely more important. We seek Christs words and probably have many of His words memorized. Well, not everyone does apparently, because Im always surprised on Jeopardy when those brainiacs often seem to know nothing about the scriptures. We Mormons, in turn, are continually lost on the "Potent Potables" category. We celebrate and rejoice in the words and the happenings of Christs birth. Does anyone, even the most bookishly versant among us, celebrate the words or circumstances of Herod and his birth?
The New Testament shows us something of the Christ child we celebrate at Christmas in the perfect young adult He has become. He hasnt become full of Himself and self-important, careworn, and brusque. Although Isaiah described Him as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted wi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Beloved students, faculty, and friends of Brigham Young University, you are a marvelous sight, and Susan and I are honored and full of gratitude to be with you today. We always feel tender feelings when we return to Brigham Young University, as this is where we met and were engaged. We met in a religion class called Your Religious Problems. I have forgotten many of the details of the class, but I do know that whatever my religious problem was, she solved it, and whatever her problem was, well, I hope I solved it too.
In a very short while your final exams will end and you will return to family or friends for Christmas. In view of the approaching Yuletide season, I have chosen to share with you today a Christmas message, a message of hope and glad tidings, even my assurance and witness of the birth, life, and eternal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
More than 700 years before his birth, Isaiah prophesied of Christ in words memorialized by George Frideric Handel in the Messiah oratorio:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. [Isaiah 9:6]
In this one concise sentence, Isaiah foretold Christs birth; His Second Coming; His millennial reign; and His eternal mission as the mighty God and Father of our salvation.
Handels Messiah also brought to glorious musical life the following admonition, based on Isaiah:
O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, . . . O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! [Handel, "O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion," Messiah; see Isaiah 40:9]
Brothers and sisters, join with me and behold your God! Behold your God, born as a little child in Bethlehem and wrapped in swaddling clothes. Behold your God, born in poverty and simplicity that He might walk among common people as a common man. Behold your God, even the infinite and eternal Redeemer, the Messiah, veiled in flesh and come to live upon the very earth that He created.
Return with me to that sacred first Christmas in Bethlehem to contemplate the birth of our Lord. He came in the quiet of the night, in the meridian of time, He who was Immanuel, the Rod of Jesse, the Dayspring, the Key of David, the very Lord of Might. His birth marked the promised visitation of the Creator to earth, the condescension of God to man. As Isaiah wrote of the event:
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. [Isaiah 9:2]
We know from modern revelation that Jesus was born on April 6, making it springtime in Judea when the anointed King of Israel came to earth. As Micah had prophes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When Elder F. Enzio Busche was attempting to make a telephone call from Frankfurt, Germany, on December 5, 1995, he accidentally pushed the wrong button and was connected to Elder Dean L. Larsen at 7:00 a.m. Elder Larsen asked how things were going. Elder Busche replied by saying, "It is hard to imagine how much we are learning from our experiences in Russia." Recently he had visited in Moscow with the mission president there, who had several branches under his direction. He had written to each branch, wanting to know what they were going to do to celebrate Christmas. Each branch president replied except one. Several additional requests to the one were made without results. Finally the mission president contacted the branch president directly about the project and was startled to hear the response, "What is Christmas?"
Each of you knows what Christmas is, but today let us explore the holiday of holidays even more deeply.
I have never before been in a position to deliver an early Christmas gift to so many in one place. That is what I hope to do this morning. If there is a group of young adults anywhere in the world more deserving of a special Christmas gift, I cannot imagine where.
A number of years ago someone began delivering gifts to us by night, leaving them on our front porch about two weeks before Christmas. We didnt know who it was. When the first gift was discovered, I asked our children to look around the driveway and our front-porch area to see if the card had simply dropped out of the package. They couldnt find the name of the person who had brought the gift to us. The same thing happened the next day. Within another day or two we figured someone had made our family the focus of the 12 days of Christmas tradition. For almost two weeks prior to Christmas that year, a wonderful young woman dropped off gifts and, in an important way, changed the lives of our children. They were so touched by her generosity and her desire to secretly do such a nice thing that they each have participated in the 12 days of Christmas for others since that time. The holiday season brings memories of her kindness.
I would like to address my remarks this day focusing on 12 presents that I would like to give you. I would prefer to deliver them in person, but that is impossible. If carefully thought about and used, they will keep you on the path of peace and joy today, tomorrow, and perhaps forever. Make this your happiest Christmas!
First Present
Let the gospel of Jesus Christ be your guide, your personal philosophy, and the main determinate of your decision making.
Several years ago a man I had known for 30 years asked if he could come and spend time with me in my office.
I said, "Yes, of course," and eagerly anticipated his visit.
When we sat down he said something that surprised me. He mentioned that there were several of us who seemed to have things f</span>
