  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="One afternoon while driving around town, I had a CD playing in my car—a collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs sung by Sarah Brightman. I was preoccupied with the traffic, so the music mostly provided a soothing background. At one point, though, the lyrics of one of the songs caught my attention, and immediately I felt moved by the sentiment of these words:

&lt;i&gt;Love,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Love changes everything:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hands and faces,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Earth and sky.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Love,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Love changes everything:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How you live and&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How you die.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Love Changes Everything,” lyrics by Don Black and Charles Hart, &lt;i&gt;Sarah Brightman: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection&lt;/i&gt; (Really Useful Group, Ltd., 1997)]

I know these lyrics refer to romantic love, but I couldn’t help reflect that in relation to the gift of charity, love really does change everything. When we are possessed of Christlike love, the way we feel about ourselves, the way we feel about others, even the way we experience reality is altered. But Christlike love isn’t the giddy wave of affection we often associate with romantic love. It is something much more subtle, something deeper. It is a love that does not alter with our moods or with external circumstances.

One of the best and most well-known descriptions we have of Christlike love is found in Moroni 7:45–47. Here Mormon stated:

&lt;i&gt;And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&lt;/i&gt; [Moroni 7:45]

When we really analyze all the attributes of Christlike love, achieving them can seem like a tall order. This passage may cause us to pause and ask ourselves if we manifest each of these qualities: Am I long-suffering? Am I kind? Am I humble? Do I think of others first? Do I hold my temper? But we need to remember that charity is a gift. These attributes are not simply a to-do list; they are a description of the way we will be if we are fully in possession of this gift. The gift of charity comes from the Savior. It is possible because of His atonement. It isn’t necessarily something we develop. Rather, charity is something &lt;i&gt;bestowed&lt;/i&gt; upon us. When we possess charity, all of our natural human tendencies are transformed, and we relate to others in a new way.

The prophet Mormon admonished us to earnestly seek this gift of love. He stated:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath&lt;/i&gt; bestowed &lt;i&gt;upon all who are true followers of his Son.&lt;/i&gt; [Moroni 7:48; emphasis added]

The gift comes, then, through earnest supplication. It comes through our faith and hope in Christ. This kind of love builds in us over time. It grows gradually as our faith in Christ grows. When we are fully possessed of it, Mormon tells us, we become even as the Savior: “That when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is” (Moroni 7:48).

Christlike love helps us overcome our natural fear of others. We may fear difference; we may worry about being hurt or slighted. But Christlike love is a love beyond fear. It reaches across the divide of difference. It is in our nature to serve our own interests or the interests of those closest to us. But charity takes us beyond our comfort zone. Suddenly we are less worried about whether others will approve of us. Our concern flows toward them regardless of their feelings for us.

Our family has had the opportunity to live overseas. And at times I have felt estranged from those who speak a language other than my own. It can be difficult to relate to someone whose daily habits and customs are alien to us. The distance between us can seem wide. But then I see a mother hold and soothe her baby, and an impression of recognition comes over me. I realize she feels just as I feel. I realize we are the same. Likewise, on many occasions I have attended Church meetings conducted in languages other than my own. It amazes me that even though I do not understand what is being said, I feel the Spirit testify of God’s love for these Saints. How remarkable it is to sit with a group of Saints singing a hymn in Japanese and realize that we share the same faith and hope in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. At these moments, in spite of our superficial differences, we are one.

Part of having Christlike love is this recognition of our affinities with one another. The gift of charity teaches us who we are. It teaches us who others are. The Apostle Paul testified that we are all God’s children and that His desire for us is that we be exalted together:

&lt;i&gt;The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.&lt;/i&gt; [Romans 8:16–17]

Through the power of Christ’s atonement we can come to recognize the powerful spiritual kinship we share with all the people of the earth. As we grow in this understanding, we can’t help but be filled with a sincere love and concern for those we are asked to serve. But we need Christ to help us realize this love and perspective. We can’t achieve it on our own.

Ken Mochizuki relates the story of Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat in Lithuania during World War II who, against the orders of his government, granted emergency visas to thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing from Poland (see Ken Mochizuki, &lt;i&gt;Passage to Freedom: The Sugihara Story&lt;/i&gt; [New York: Lee and Low Books, 1997]). Shortly after the Nazis invaded Poland, hundreds of Jewish refugees gathered outside the embassy in Lithuania, entreating Mr. Sugihara for visas to give them safe passage out of Eastern Europe. Three times Mr. Sugihara petitioned the Japanese government for permission to grant the visas. Three times his government answered no. After the third time Mr. Sugihara told his wife, “I have to do something. I may have to disobey my government, but if I don’t, I will be disobeying God” (Mochizuki, &lt;i&gt;Passage,&lt;/i&gt; 14). Over the course of a month Mr. Sugihara wrote out thousands of visas in his own hand so that no other person would be held responsible. Later, Mr. Sugihara and his family were imprisoned for 18 months in a Soviet internment camp. After he returned to Japan he was forced to resign from diplomatic service.

This man sought not his own safety or his own reward but sacrificed on behalf of people he did not even know. These people had little in common with him culturally, religiously, or racially. But they were people to whom he felt bound by a higher impulse, an impulse grounded in moral understanding and unselfish love. Are we willing to sacrifice personal position, comfort, and safety for our brothers and sisters? Do we pray for this kind of faith and love?

Mr. Sugihara’s actions were prompted by extreme circumstances, and the personal implications of his choices were severe. We may never be called upon to make such dramatic sacrifices on behalf of others. But we, too, are daily met with choices that compel us to put aside personal comfort or gain for the sake of others. The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to be ready to make these choices well. All of us struggle with tendencies that would keep us from choosing to serve and love others as Christ would. It isn’t easy to see past ourselves. It isn’t always easy to open our hearts. We may find ourselves feeling envious of others or wishing we had more. But if truly we had love, we would see things differently. At times we may be blind to the feelings and needs of others and may need to be taught to see. We must pray continually for such discernment, conscientiousness, and humility. In short, we need to pray for charity, which is the pure love of Christ.

In 1 Timothy 1:5, Paul explained that God blesses us with the gift of charity when we have a pure heart, a clear conscience, and faith in the Savior. He explained: “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.” The Lord will not bless us with charity without a pure heart. This means we must have righteous desires. The Lord will not bless us with charity without a clear conscience. This means we must be repentant and our thoughts must not be compromised by excuses, lies, or delusions. And, finally, He will not bless us with the gift of charity if we lack faith. This means we must believe steadfastly in Christ’s atonement and its power to change us.

If we continue earnestly with faith and hope in Christ to seek the gift of charity, it will be granted to us. We will be filled with a love of God and of all people. Paul promised that as we attain this gift, so will we receive of a fullness of God’s love:

&lt;i&gt;That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.&lt;/i&gt; [Ephesians 3:17–19]

Brothers and sisters, may we seek this fullness, this love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>One afternoon while driving around town, I had a CD playing in my car—a collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs sung by Sarah Brightman. I was preoccupied with the traffic, so the music mostly provided a soothing background. At one point, though, the lyrics of one of the songs caught my attention, and immediately I felt moved by the sentiment of these words:</p>
<p><i>Love,</i><br />
<i>Love changes everything:</i><br />
<i>Hands and faces,</i><br />
<i>Earth and sky.</i><br />
<i>Love,</i><br />
<i>Love changes everything:</i><br />
<i>How you live and</i><br />
<i>How you die.</i><br />
[“Love Changes Everything,” lyrics by Don Black and Charles Hart, <i>Sarah Brightman: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection</i> (Really Useful Group, Ltd., 1997)]</p>
<p>I know these lyrics refer to romantic love, but I couldn’t help reflect that in relation to the gift of charity, love really does change everything. When we are possessed of Christlike love, the way we feel about ourselves, the way we feel about others, even the way we experience reality is altered. But Christlike love isn’t the giddy wave of affection we often associate with romantic love. It is something much more subtle, something deeper. It is a love that does not alter with our moods or with external circumstances.</p>
<p>One of the best and most well-known descriptions we have of Christlike love is found in Moroni 7:45–47. Here Mormon stated:</p>
<p><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i> [Moroni 7:45]</p>
<p>When we really analyze all the attributes of Christlike love, achieving them can seem like a tall order. This passage may cause us to pause and ask ourselves if we manifest each of these qualities: Am I long-suffering? Am I kind? Am I humble? Do I think of others first? Do I hold my temper? But we need to remember that charity is a gift. These attributes are not simply a to-do list; they are a description of the way we will be if we are fully in possession of this gift. The gift of charity comes from the Savior. It is possible because of His atonement. It isn’t necessarily something we develop. Rather, charity is something <i>bestowed</i> upon us. When we possess charity, all of our natural human tendencies are transformed, and we relate to others in a new way.</p>
<p>The prophet Mormon admonished us to earnestly seek this gift of love. He stated:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath</i> bestowed <i>upon all who are true followers of his Son.</i> [Moroni 7:48; emphasis added]</p>
<p>The gift comes, then, through earnest supplication. It comes through our faith and hope in Christ. This kind of love builds in us over time. It grows gradually as our faith in Christ grows. When we are fully possessed of it, Mormon tells us, we become even as the Savior: “That when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is” (Moroni 7:48).</p>
<p>Christlike love helps us overcome our natural fear of others. We may fear difference; we may worry about being hurt or slighted. But Christlike love is a love beyond fear. It reaches across the divide of difference. It is in our nature to serve our own interests or the interests of those closest to us. But charity takes us beyond our comfort zone. Suddenly we are less worried about whether others will approve of us. Our concern flows toward them regardless of their feelings for us.</p>
<p>Our family has had the opportunity to live overseas. And at times I have felt estranged from those who speak a language other than my own. It can be difficult to relate to someone whose daily habits and customs are alien to us. The distance between us can seem wide. But then I see a mother hold and soothe her baby, and an impression of recognition comes over me. I realize she feels just as I feel. I realize we are the same. Likewise, on many occasions I have attended Church meetings conducted in languages other than my own. It amazes me that even though I do not understand what is being said, I feel the Spirit testify of God’s love for these Saints. How remarkable it is to sit with a group of Saints singing a hymn in Japanese and realize that we share the same faith and hope in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. At these moments, in spite of our superficial differences, we are one.</p>
<p>Part of having Christlike love is this recognition of our affinities with one another. The gift of charity teaches us who we are. It teaches us who others are. The Apostle Paul testified that we are all God’s children and that His desire for us is that we be exalted together:</p>
<p><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i></p>
<p><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</i> [Romans 8:16–17]</p>
<p>Through the power of Christ’s atonement we can come to recognize the powerful spiritual kinship we share with all the people of the earth. As we grow in this understanding, we can’t help but be filled with a sincere love and concern for those we are asked to serve. But we need Christ to help us realize this love and perspective. We can’t achieve it on our own.</p>
<p>Ken Mochizuki relates the story of Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat in Lithuania during World War II who, against the orders of his government, granted emergency visas to thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing from Poland (see Ken Mochizuki, <i>Passage to Freedom: The Sugihara Story</i> [New York: Lee and Low Books, 1997]). Shortly after the Nazis invaded Poland, hundreds of Jewish refugees gathered outside the embassy in Lithuania, entreating Mr. Sugihara for visas to give them safe passage out of Eastern Europe. Three times Mr. Sugihara petitioned the Japanese government for permission to grant the visas. Three times his government answered no. After the third time Mr. Sugihara told his wife, “I have to do something. I may have to disobey my government, but if I don’t, I will be disobeying God” (Mochizuki, <i>Passage,</i> 14). Over the course of a month Mr. Sugihara wrote out thousands of visas in his own hand so that no other person would be held responsible. Later, Mr. Sugihara and his family were imprisoned for 18 months in a Soviet internment camp. After he returned to Japan he was forced to resign from diplomatic service.</p>
<p>This man sought not his own safety or his own reward but sacrificed on behalf of people he did not even know. These people had little in common with him culturally, religiously, or racially. But they were people to whom he felt bound by a higher impulse, an impulse grounded in moral understanding and unselfish love. Are we willing to sacrifice personal position, comfort, and safety for our brothers and sisters? Do we pray for this kind of faith and love?</p>
<p>Mr. Sugihara’s actions were prompted by extreme circumstances, and the personal implications of his choices were severe. We may never be called upon to make such dramatic sacrifices on behalf of others. But we, too, are daily met with choices that compel us to put aside personal comfort or gain for the sake of others. The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to be ready to make these choices well. All of us struggle with tendencies that would keep us from choosing to serve and love others as Christ would. It isn’t easy to see past ourselves. It isn’t always easy to open our hearts. We may find ourselves feeling envious of others or wishing we had more. But if truly we had love, we would see things differently. At times we may be blind to the feelings and needs of others and may need to be taught to see. We must pray continually for such discernment, conscientiousness, and humility. In short, we need to pray for charity, which is the pure love of Christ.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:5, Paul explained that God blesses us with the gift of charity when we have a pure heart, a clear conscience, and faith in the Savior. He explained: “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.” The Lord will not bless us with charity without a pure heart. This means we must have righteous desires. The Lord will not bless us with charity without a clear conscience. This means we must be repentant and our thoughts must not be compromised by excuses, lies, or delusions. And, finally, He will not bless us with the gift of charity if we lack faith. This means we must believe steadfastly in Christ’s atonement and its power to change us.</p>
<p>If we continue earnestly with faith and hope in Christ to seek the gift of charity, it will be granted to us. We will be filled with a love of God and of all people. Paul promised that as we attain this gift, so will we receive of a fullness of God’s love:</p>
<p><i>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</i></p>
<p><i>May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</i></p>
<p><i>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</i> [Ephesians 3:17–19]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, may we seek this fullness, this love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">At some point after my first couple of years at BYU, a brother in my ward, who was retired from the BYU religion faculty, said, “Hey, you could speak at a devotional!”
I don’t know why he thought I might be qualified for that, but I shrugged it off, thinking that if I sang often enough, I would surely be exempt from speaking. Just recently I had the thought that since I have been at BYU for ten years, I might need to lay low to dodge the devotional bullet.
However, six weeks ago I received an email from Vice President Matt Richardson asking if I would be willing to speak at this devotional. I reluctantly replied that I would accept the challenge, though I am not sure that “happily” would describe my attitude.
As I prayed for guidance on a topic, this thought came to me: “I am a reluctant grower.” I had never used that term before, though it seemed to suit me well, so I can only guess that the Spirit had coined that phrase just for me.
Needing clarification on that phrase, I went to Google for a precise definition of reluctant. It said that reluctant is an adjective that means “unwilling and hesitant; disinclined.” Its synonyms include being “loath to, unwilling to, disinclined to, indisposed to; not in favor of, against, opposed to.” It’s antonyms include being “willing” and “eager.” The word reluctant originated in the mid-seventeenth century from the Latin word reluctant, which means “struggling against,” and from the verb reluctari: the prefix re- means “expressing intensive force” and the suffix luctari means “to struggle.” As a side note, the word ­reluctant is worth eleven points in Scrabble.
Am I, as this definition says, unwilling, hesitant, and even disinclined to grow? I will refer to myself, since I am confessing that I am a reluctant grower, but feel free to insert your name where applicable.
Am I Reluctant?
What is it that sometimes makes me hesitant to face a growing opportunity? I am not against hard work. I bore both of my children while pursuing a doctorate, working two jobs, singing operas on the main stage at Indiana University (one of the top music schools in the country), and maintaining a 3.9 GPA. No, I am not opposed to hard work.
Is it that I am not wanting to participate in activities? I am more than willing to fulfill my callings, go visiting teaching, take a dinner—that likely my good husband expertly cooked—to another family, or participate in my ward’s day of service. No, I am willing to do things that are asked of me.
Am I afraid of the process of growing? Many times while sitting in Relief Society I will hear a sister say, “I prayed for patience” or “I prayed for charity.”
I think, “Are you crazy?! Do you not know what challenges come when you pray for Christlike attributes?”
They then proceed to tell of the tr</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Over the past month our ward has welcomed several newborn babies. Each baby comes to this earth curious and  eager to learn. They want to taste everything, chew everything, and pull on everything. I imagine that from a baby’s point of view, everything in this world is new and amazing.
As we anticipated our exodus from  the spirit world, we placed great trust in the plan of salvation. We trusted Heavenly Father and our Savior. In Their wisdom, They knew that our spirits would initially flourish best in the physical form of a baby. When  our spirits were united with our physical bodies, we became helpless and totally dependent on our caregivers. We forgot our previous knowledge and relationships. It must have been a huge shock to have our spirit and  physical body unite. But we were confident in the plan of salvation—we were confident that this earthly life, including the merging of our spirit and physical body, was a necessary step in our eternal progression.  Confident in our Savior’s Atonement, we came to earth knowing that we could return to our heavenly home. Each of us started our life fresh and innocent, and we began to learn the many things we needed to know in order  to function on this earth and continue our eternal progression.
We are children of our Heavenly Father; each individual who comes to this earth is given an extraordinary capacity for learning and growth. We  have opportunities in this life to learn information that would have been difficult—if not impossible—to learn in the spirit world. For instance, learning to ride a bicycle would be difficult to accomplish if we only  observed others riding their bicycles. Even more difficult would be learning to ride a bicycle if our sole preparation was merely reading books about bicycle riding. Learning by doing is an amazing process. Most of us  scraped our knees and elbows as we repeatedly tried to master cycling—without the training wheels. Most of us were successful. We now ride a bicycle without much thought regarding our initial difficulties, fears, and  injuries. Fortunately, as young children we were not faced with simultaneous challenges that overwhelmed our capacity to learn and progress. For example, on the same day—or week—that we learned to ride a bicycle, we  were not faced with learning to drive a car, pilot an airplane, and fly a rocket to the moon. Typically, as Nephi described in 2 Nephi 28:30, our learning progresses “line upon line, precept upon precept.”
At  Brigham Young University, before we “go forth to serve,” we “enter to learn.” We read books, listen to lectures, discuss topics, write papers, and take tests. Many of you will complete a practicum or internship in which  you will apply your academic learning to real-life situations. “The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth” (D&amp;C 93:36).
Whatever principle of intelligence we attain  unt</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I’m grateful for this invitation to speak at devotional today. Devotionals have always been a part of Brigham Young University campus life. They were first instituted by Karl G. Maeser and early on were offered on a daily basis. By the 1920s, devotionals were held three times a week. Although the number of devotionals per week has changed over the history of the university, their importance to the campus community has remained constant. Karl G. Maesar’s term as president ended in the 1880s, so we know it has been at least that long that these devotionals have been a traditional part of our campus.
Some years ago I was in a meeting with former academic vice president John Tanner. We were discussing some matters when the devotional became part of the conversation. Vice President Tanner mentioned the importance of the BYU devotional as one of the few experiences on campus we do as a community—what a rich tradition and one that brings us together in body and spirit.
Traditions have the ability to bind us generationally. Most often we associate traditions with holidays and celebrations. But they can simply be the handing down of statements, beliefs, legends, customs, and information that moves from generation to generation. This can happen by word of mouth or by practice. Defining the word tradition varies by academic disciplines. I’m simply going to define it here broadly for discussion purposes. For my purpose it will encompass the idea of continued accepted norms, patterns, or customs.
My wife, Gwen, and I recently returned from New Zealand. She spent her teenage years growing up in Wellington. We accompanied other members of her family who were returning back home to New Zealand for the first time in over thirty years. Near the end of our trip, we were making our way from the Bay of Plenty area toward Auckland. En route we planned on attending church in the City of Tauranga. There was no particular reason for selecting this place other than it was halfway between our two destinations. While we were attending the Tauranga Ward, we met a Brother Tata, who invited us to follow him after church to a neighborhood within the city. We followed him to the gates of a Maori marae. A marae is a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Maori culture. It doesn’t have to be a building; it can be an open space. To the Maori, the marae is a place just as important to them as their homes.
Brother Tata invited us through the gates and into a courtyard. After a brief moment there, we walked over to the building, took off our shoes, and were invited in. We partook of a ceremony, much of which was spoken in Maori. He then explained to us that, as a young missionary and future apostle, Matthew Cowley began his mission at the location of this marae. He told us that David O. McKay had come to this marae when the New Zealand Temple was dedicated and had brought other General Authorities with hi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">A well-worn and much-loved poem by Robert Frost introduces the subject. You may know the work, or perhaps you have heard only the oft-quoted last lines:
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
[Robert Frost, “The Road Not Taken” (1916)]
Each day our literal and figurative feet carry us to places where the roads diverge, and we must choose. Some of the choices are no-brainers, in the current vernacular, while some tax our mental capacities. Some seem to be of little consequence while others appear to hold eternity in the balance and really do make “all the difference.” Because we are here, in part, to learn to make righteous and right choices, perhaps none is trivial in the longest view. Contrast the thoughtful and deliberate approach to choices and consequences suggested by Frost’s poem with the sign that Sister Griffen and I saw in Las Vegas. The sign declared, “Wedding Chapel: No Waiting, No Questions, No Thinking!” We had a good laugh at the sign as we recognized the irony in seeing it on our way to a temple wedding. But the sobering reality is that too many—in and out of the Church—think about some choices too little and fail to connect the road they choose with the place to which it leads.
The Freedom to Choose
Go with me to a vaguely familiar but not quite remembered place and a time too remote to contemplate, where perhaps time as we understand it had no meaning. There was one who would have denied each of us our moral agency—the freedom to choose for good or ill—in order to exalt himself. There was One, also, who saw through that ruse and declared Himself on the side of agency. The scriptures tell of a war full of casualties, except that physical death was not possible for anyone there. No, the cost—spiritual death—was far more serious. Listen to this, from John the Beloved, writing in Revelation:
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his a</span>
