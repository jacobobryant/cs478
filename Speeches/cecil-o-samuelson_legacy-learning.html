  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Once again it is an exciting and anticipatory pleasure for Sister Samuelson and me to welcome each of you to a new school year. I am confident we will have a special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies this semester that will complement, supplement, and, we hope, enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday at this same time and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you. As I have said before, a large part of what constitutes the unique “BYU experience” is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus.

In this wonderful year of anniversaries and celebration concerning the events of the birth of the Prophet Joseph, the organization of the Church, and other milestones special to us, I would like to spend our precious moments this morning in continuing to reflect on the legacy of learning that we enjoy, largely influenced by the example and efforts of living prophets from Joseph Smith to Gordon B. Hinckley.

It is both comforting and encouraging to note that even the Lord, Jesus Christ, and prophets of every age, including our own, have over the course of their lives “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (Luke 2:52). They have provided for us not only the philosophical and doctrinal basis but also the personal examples of the principles of eternal progression that occur in our lives “line upon line, precept upon precept” (D&amp;amp;C 98:12, 128:21). I firmly believe that each of us also enjoys the privilege and has the responsibility of similarly growing, developing, learning, and contributing in our own spheres and within the unique opportunities and circumstances that are afforded us.

Although it is unlikely that I need to remind this group that learning is both exhilarating and plain hard work, I will do so because this combination is often overlooked by those who would emphasize one dimension or the other. Particularly at the Testing Center, for example, it is tempting to think of the drudgery and demands of preparing to succeed in course work and to diminish the wonderful excitement that should result from the new insights, facts, and understanding that have occurred during a semester’s activities.

Likewise, when we reflect on the magnitude and splendor of the Prophet Joseph’s theophany in the Sacred Grove, we may not remember or fully understand that even that most remarkable tutorial was given in the context of considerable effort and contemplation as well as by study and faith. Thus the constant and continuing counsel from the early days of the Restoration that we must “seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 88:118, 109:7, 14) should not surprise us and, in fact, should lead us in every field of inquiry, both temporal and spiritual.

Given the fact that Joseph Smith, especially by today’s standards but also by his own admission, was not well educated in a formal sense, it is truly remarkable how he became such an example of lifelong learning “by study and also by faith.” In addition to his almost incredible ability to master complicated specific concepts and ideas—such as languages, politics, military strategy, and architecture—he was also a tremendous generalist who in his short 38-year life became a great student of men and things.

Clearly his many revelations came at a time vital to the emerging Church, but also almost always in consequence of a substantial problem or significant question. Some of these questions or problems occurred as the result of external causes or events, but many, particularly spectacular doctrinal insights, were the result of his consistent study, prayer, pondering, and questioning. He considered, as should we, that his revelations were great learning experiences.

He also was regularly questioned, not only by the Latter-day Saints but by many others as well. He felt obliged to help people learn, and he was obviously a very compelling teacher. He was not afraid of questions—nor should we be. In fact, to my knowledge he was one of the first to use the 20-questions format to teach important principles. In 1838 Joseph published 20 questions with his answers to them. He did this, as he reported, “to save [him]self the trouble of repeating the same a thousand times over and over again” (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 3:30; &lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; 121).

We don’t have time to consider all 20 questions and his answers, but I will mention a few because I believe they tell us so much about him and his thought, his humor, his forthrightness, his love of learning, his confidence in his mission, and his desire to share the truths of the Restoration.

&lt;i&gt;First—“Do you believe the Bible?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;If we do, we are the only people under heaven that does, for there are none of the religious sects of the day that do. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Fifth—“Do you believe Joseph Smith, Jun., to be a Prophet?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;Yes, and every other man who has the testimony of Jesus. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&lt;/i&gt; [Revelation 19:10]. . . .

&lt;i&gt;Eighth—“Can they [the Mormons] raise the dead?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;No, nor can any other people that now lives, or ever did live. But God can raise the dead, through man as an instrument. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tenth—“Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Eleventh—“Did not Joseph Smith steal his wife?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;Ask her, she was of age, she can answer for herself. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Sixteenth—“If the Mormon doctrine is true, what has become of all those who died since the days of the Apostles?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;All those who have not had an opportunity of hearing the Gospel, and being administered unto by an inspired man in the flesh, must have it hereafter, before they can be finally judged. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Eighteenth—“Is there anything in the Bible which licenses you to believe in revelation now-a-days?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;Is there anything that does not authorize us to believe so? If there is, we have, as yet, not been able to find it.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nineteenth—“Is not the canon of the Scriptures full?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;If it is, there is a great defect in the book, or else it would have said so.&lt;/i&gt;

And now, for the last question in the series. This is among the most oft quoted of any of Joseph’s statements because it is so fundamental to our beliefs and the understanding of them:

&lt;i&gt;Twentieth—“What are the fundamental principles of your religion?”&lt;/i&gt;

[Answer] &lt;i&gt;The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it. But in connection with these, we believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost, the power of faith, the enjoyment of the spiritual gifts according to the will of God, the restoration of the house of Israel, and the final triumph of truth.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 3:28–30; &lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; 119–21]

As you see, Joseph was not put off by questions. He was also very clear about what things are basic and fundamental. He understood the difference between what he really knew and those things he did not know. He also never considered himself nor anyone else, except the Savior, to be a finished product. He once said the following in describing himself, but I am sure he would not be offended if fellow disciples were also to apply this analogy to themselves:

&lt;i&gt;I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women—all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 5:401; &lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; 304]

Likewise, while he was most often modest and careful, he was willing to be absolutely clear on the things of most importance that he learned and that he taught. He said, “I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught” (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 6:366; &lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; 368).

Joseph Smith was most impressive to some of the men hardest to impress. Elder B. H. Roberts was one such man. Listen to these editorial comments by Elder Roberts in the introduction of volume 2 of the &lt;i&gt;History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The value of the educational movement in the Church by the establishment of a school for the Elders in Kirtland, cannot be fully appreciated even yet. It stands as a direct contradiction to the oft-repeated charges that Mormonism seeks to thrive through the ignorance of its devotees.&lt;/i&gt;

B. H. Roberts supported this assertion by referencing some Restoration scriptures that I will share in a moment. He then continued:

&lt;i&gt;I know of nothing that lies outside this boundless field of research into which the Elders of the Church especially were invited—nay, commanded, to enter. It comprehends the whole possible sphere of human investigation; and furnishes all necessary contradiction to the theory that the Church at any time contemplated an ignorant ministry. By intelligence, not stupidity; by knowledge, not ignorance, has the Church from the very beginning hoped to succeed in her mission.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 2:xxiv]

Elder Roberts held that the Prophet Joseph, under the direction of the Lord, was primarily responsible for the beginning of the educational emphasis and movement within the newly restored Church.

Joseph encouraged continual learning and the acquisition not only of knowledge but also of wisdom. His doctrine was expansive rather than restrictive. These revelatory words, referred to by Elder Roberts, are now well known to us and repeated often, especially at BYU: “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Likewise, from the same section, consider this counsel to students, faculty, and all of us:

&lt;i&gt;Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79]

In these brief verses are encompassed not only our complete BYU curriculum but also all that we are likely to encounter during our entire mortal lives. In my judgment Joseph Smith was not concerned with parsing too finely those things that we should study as long as they are “anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy” because he affirmed that “we seek after these things” (Articles of Faith 1:13).

As we all know, Joseph did not live personally to see the Rocky Mountains in mortality; thus BYU came after his time. As grateful as we are and must be to Brigham Young and our other early and current leaders for the establishment and continued support of this great university, we must never forget that it was Joseph Smith who prophesied that the Latter-day Saints would come to these valleys and “become a mighty people” (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 5:85). In my judgment, our progress as both individuals and as an institution in educational achievement is an important criterion in the fulfillment of that prophecy. While we have made some impressive progress, I am convinced that our best is ahead of us and yet to come.

I would not be surprised to learn in some future time that Joseph not only saw our day but also what we at BYU will and must yet become as we progress along the eternal continuum of the legacy of learning. “Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!” and who, under the direction of the Father and the Son, established the foundation for all that we consider basic in our individual and collective efforts to be ever learning and, more important, ever more wise and more faithful (“Praise to the Man,” &lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 27).

What a wonderful bequest! And what a remarkable blessing to live at this time with our most fortunate circumstances that bring us the privilege of being at BYU. We have the opportunity to continue the vital process of expanding our understanding and acquiring knowledge and wisdom. Through Joseph we better understand that

&lt;i&gt;whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]

I am grateful to verbalize with gratitude and certitude my convictions concerning the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, which includes our legacy of learning. I also bear witness of our current prophet-leader, Gordon B. Hinckley, who is an outspoken advocate for learning and also for Brigham Young University. Our Father in Heaven and the Savior Jesus Christ do live and direct Their servants in this work, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Once again it is an exciting and anticipatory pleasure for Sister Samuelson and me to welcome each of you to a new school year. I am confident we will have a special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies this semester that will complement, supplement, and, we hope, enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday at this same time and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you. As I have said before, a large part of what constitutes the unique “BYU experience” is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus.</p>
<p>In this wonderful year of anniversaries and celebration concerning the events of the birth of the Prophet Joseph, the organization of the Church, and other milestones special to us, I would like to spend our precious moments this morning in continuing to reflect on the legacy of learning that we enjoy, largely influenced by the example and efforts of living prophets from Joseph Smith to Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>
<p>It is both comforting and encouraging to note that even the Lord, Jesus Christ, and prophets of every age, including our own, have over the course of their lives “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (Luke 2:52). They have provided for us not only the philosophical and doctrinal basis but also the personal examples of the principles of eternal progression that occur in our lives “line upon line, precept upon precept” (D&amp;C 98:12, 128:21). I firmly believe that each of us also enjoys the privilege and has the responsibility of similarly growing, developing, learning, and contributing in our own spheres and within the unique opportunities and circumstances that are afforded us.</p>
<p>Although it is unlikely that I need to remind this group that learning is both exhilarating and plain hard work, I will do so because this combination is often overlooked by those who would emphasize one dimension or the other. Particularly at the Testing Center, for example, it is tempting to think of the drudgery and demands of preparing to succeed in course work and to diminish the wonderful excitement that should result from the new insights, facts, and understanding that have occurred during a semester’s activities.</p>
<p>Likewise, when we reflect on the magnitude and splendor of the Prophet Joseph’s theophany in the Sacred Grove, we may not remember or fully understand that even that most remarkable tutorial was given in the context of considerable effort and contemplation as well as by study and faith. Thus the constant and continuing counsel from the early days of the Restoration that we must “seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 88:118, 109:7, 14) should not surprise us and, in fact, should lead us in every field of inquiry, both temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>Given the fact that Joseph Smith, especially by today’s standards but also by his own admission, was not well educated in a formal sense, it is truly remarkable how he became such an example of lifelong learning “by study and also by faith.” In addition to his almost incredible ability to master complicated specific concepts and ideas—such as languages, politics, military strategy, and architecture—he was also a tremendous generalist who in his short 38-year life became a great student of men and things.</p>
<p>Clearly his many revelations came at a time vital to the emerging Church, but also almost always in consequence of a substantial problem or significant question. Some of these questions or problems occurred as the result of external causes or events, but many, particularly spectacular doctrinal insights, were the result of his consistent study, prayer, pondering, and questioning. He considered, as should we, that his revelations were great learning experiences.</p>
<p>He also was regularly questioned, not only by the Latter-day Saints but by many others as well. He felt obliged to help people learn, and he was obviously a very compelling teacher. He was not afraid of questions—nor should we be. In fact, to my knowledge he was one of the first to use the 20-questions format to teach important principles. In 1838 Joseph published 20 questions with his answers to them. He did this, as he reported, “to save [him]self the trouble of repeating the same a thousand times over and over again” (<i>HC</i> 3:30; <i>Teachings,</i> 121).</p>
<p>We don’t have time to consider all 20 questions and his answers, but I will mention a few because I believe they tell us so much about him and his thought, his humor, his forthrightness, his love of learning, his confidence in his mission, and his desire to share the truths of the Restoration.</p>
<p><i>First—“Do you believe the Bible?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>If we do, we are the only people under heaven that does, for there are none of the religious sects of the day that do. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Fifth—“Do you believe Joseph Smith, Jun., to be a Prophet?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>Yes, and every other man who has the testimony of Jesus. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</i> [Revelation 19:10]. . . .</p>
<p><i>Eighth—“Can they [the Mormons] raise the dead?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>No, nor can any other people that now lives, or ever did live. But God can raise the dead, through man as an instrument. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Tenth—“Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.</i></p>
<p><i>Eleventh—“Did not Joseph Smith steal his wife?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>Ask her, she was of age, she can answer for herself. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Sixteenth—“If the Mormon doctrine is true, what has become of all those who died since the days of the Apostles?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>All those who have not had an opportunity of hearing the Gospel, and being administered unto by an inspired man in the flesh, must have it hereafter, before they can be finally judged. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Eighteenth—“Is there anything in the Bible which licenses you to believe in revelation now-a-days?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>Is there anything that does not authorize us to believe so? If there is, we have, as yet, not been able to find it.</i></p>
<p><i>Nineteenth—“Is not the canon of the Scriptures full?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>If it is, there is a great defect in the book, or else it would have said so.</i></p>
<p>And now, for the last question in the series. This is among the most oft quoted of any of Joseph’s statements because it is so fundamental to our beliefs and the understanding of them:</p>
<p><i>Twentieth—“What are the fundamental principles of your religion?”</i></p>
<p>[Answer] <i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it. But in connection with these, we believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost, the power of faith, the enjoyment of the spiritual gifts according to the will of God, the restoration of the house of Israel, and the final triumph of truth.</i> [<i>HC</i> 3:28–30; <i>Teachings,</i> 119–21]</p>
<p>As you see, Joseph was not put off by questions. He was also very clear about what things are basic and fundamental. He understood the difference between what he really knew and those things he did not know. He also never considered himself nor anyone else, except the Savior, to be a finished product. He once said the following in describing himself, but I am sure he would not be offended if fellow disciples were also to apply this analogy to themselves:</p>
<p><i>I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women—all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.</i> [<i>HC</i> 5:401; <i>Teachings,</i> 304]</p>
<p>Likewise, while he was most often modest and careful, he was willing to be absolutely clear on the things of most importance that he learned and that he taught. He said, “I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught” (<i>HC</i> 6:366; <i>Teachings,</i> 368).</p>
<p>Joseph Smith was most impressive to some of the men hardest to impress. Elder B. H. Roberts was one such man. Listen to these editorial comments by Elder Roberts in the introduction of volume 2 of the <i>History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:</i></p>
<p><i>The value of the educational movement in the Church by the establishment of a school for the Elders in Kirtland, cannot be fully appreciated even yet. It stands as a direct contradiction to the oft-repeated charges that Mormonism seeks to thrive through the ignorance of its devotees.</i></p>
<p>B. H. Roberts supported this assertion by referencing some Restoration scriptures that I will share in a moment. He then continued:</p>
<p><i>I know of nothing that lies outside this boundless field of research into which the Elders of the Church especially were invited—nay, commanded, to enter. It comprehends the whole possible sphere of human investigation; and furnishes all necessary contradiction to the theory that the Church at any time contemplated an ignorant ministry. By intelligence, not stupidity; by knowledge, not ignorance, has the Church from the very beginning hoped to succeed in her mission.</i> [<i>HC</i> 2:xxiv]</p>
<p>Elder Roberts held that the Prophet Joseph, under the direction of the Lord, was primarily responsible for the beginning of the educational emphasis and movement within the newly restored Church.</p>
<p>Joseph encouraged continual learning and the acquisition not only of knowledge but also of wisdom. His doctrine was expansive rather than restrictive. These revelatory words, referred to by Elder Roberts, are now well known to us and repeated often, especially at BYU: “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 88:118). Likewise, from the same section, consider this counsel to students, faculty, and all of us:</p>
<p><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i></p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;C 88:78–79]</p>
<p>In these brief verses are encompassed not only our complete BYU curriculum but also all that we are likely to encounter during our entire mortal lives. In my judgment Joseph Smith was not concerned with parsing too finely those things that we should study as long as they are “anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy” because he affirmed that “we seek after these things” (Articles of Faith 1:13).</p>
<p>As we all know, Joseph did not live personally to see the Rocky Mountains in mortality; thus BYU came after his time. As grateful as we are and must be to Brigham Young and our other early and current leaders for the establishment and continued support of this great university, we must never forget that it was Joseph Smith who prophesied that the Latter-day Saints would come to these valleys and “become a mighty people” (<i>HC</i> 5:85). In my judgment, our progress as both individuals and as an institution in educational achievement is an important criterion in the fulfillment of that prophecy. While we have made some impressive progress, I am convinced that our best is ahead of us and yet to come.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised to learn in some future time that Joseph not only saw our day but also what we at BYU will and must yet become as we progress along the eternal continuum of the legacy of learning. “Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!” and who, under the direction of the Father and the Son, established the foundation for all that we consider basic in our individual and collective efforts to be ever learning and, more important, ever more wise and more faithful (“Praise to the Man,” <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 27).</p>
<p>What a wonderful bequest! And what a remarkable blessing to live at this time with our most fortunate circumstances that bring us the privilege of being at BYU. We have the opportunity to continue the vital process of expanding our understanding and acquiring knowledge and wisdom. Through Joseph we better understand that</p>
<p><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i></p>
<p><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i> [D&amp;C 130:18–19]</p>
<p>I am grateful to verbalize with gratitude and certitude my convictions concerning the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, which includes our legacy of learning. I also bear witness of our current prophet-leader, Gordon B. Hinckley, who is an outspoken advocate for learning and also for Brigham Young University. Our Father in Heaven and the Savior Jesus Christ do live and direct Their servants in this work, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, it is a surreal experience to be standing here talking to you today. Forty-eight years ago I first set foot on this campus as a seventeen-year-old freshman. I remember attending BYU devotionals in the Smith Fieldhouse (because there was no Marriott Center yet), listening to speakers just like you are doing.
Things have changed a lot since then. The female students were not allowed to wear pants on campus—yes, we were cold all winter long. We whitewashed the Y on the mountain every year with a very long bucket brigade, and the Y was lit with real fire. David O. McKay was the prophet, Lyndon B. Johnson was the president of the United States, and I had lost a good friend in the war in Vietnam. The good news is that I did graduate from BYU. The bad news is that it took me forty-one years to do it. I was very elated at the event, but I do not recommend that educational strategy!
I can assure you that there is nothing in my life that could possibly have given me the notion that someday I would be standing at a podium in the Marriott Center delivering a devotional address. Just as with so many events that have taken place in my life during the past three and a half years, I truly relate to Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley, who often said that she was “wondering how a nice girl like me got into a mess like this.”1 Maybe there are some lessons to be learned from this.
Lessons from the Life of Joseph Smith
The month of December is the birth month of the Prophet Joseph Smith. With that as inspiration, I would like to talk about three principles inspired by events from the early life of Joseph Smith that might be of value in your current situations and lives.
Lesson 1: You Have an Important Mission to Fulfill
President Gordon B. Hinckley once quoted Reverend Edward T. Sullivan, who said:
When God wants a great work done in the world or a great wrong righted, he goes about it in a very unusual way. He doesn’t stir up his earthquakes or send forth his thunderbolts. Instead, he has a helpless baby born.2
After a long period of apostasy and spiritual darkness, the time had come to fulfill the promises of the Lord that the Church of Jesus Christ would be restored to the earth with all of the keys and authority found in the original Church in Christ’s day. How would the Lord accomplish this great task? A baby was born.
On December 23, 1805, a poor farmer’s wife by the name of Lucy Mack Smith gave birth to a baby boy who was named after his father, Joseph Smith. He was their fourth child—he had two older brothers and an older sister.3 Who could have guessed that this little obscure baby boy born in a small rented log house in the woods of Vermont to a family of very meager means would one da</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In my young years growing up in Logan, Utah, I was part of a musical family. My grandfather, Francis H. Baugh Jr., affectionately known in the community as Frank Baugh, was the director of music for nearly thirty years in the Logan City School District, where he directed the high school choral groups and musical productions in addition to supervising music education in the junior high and elementary schools. He was Logan’s own music man.
By the time I was in elementary school he had retired from teaching in the public system, leaving him time to teach my siblings and me the piano. Not too many people can say they took piano lessons from their grandfather, but I did—he was my one and only teacher.
Every piano lesson included playing hymns from the LDS hymnal. Grandfather would have me go over each hymn several times while he pointed out fingering and dynamics and told me to “make the long notes longer and the short notes shorter.” And since Grandfather was a choral director and a singer—a beautiful tenor, I might add—he would sing the hymns, every verse, as I would play them. By the time I was a teenager I could play many of the hymns, but surprisingly I could also sing the words of those hymns by heart because I had heard my grandfather sing them so many times.
Around the time I was in junior high school, my grandfather must have felt I was ready to take on the longest hymn in the hymnal: number 296, which was titled “The Seer, Joseph, the Seer,” a poem written by John Taylor and later set to music by Ebenezer Beesley. Fortunately for me it was in the key of C, but it was four pages long, not to mention it was a choir number. I can’t play it today, but I can still hear my grandfather’s clear tenor voice singing the words:
The Seer, the Seer, Joseph, the Seer!
I’ll sing of the Prophet ever dear . . . ;
His equal now cannot be found
By searching the wide world around.
With Gods he soared in the realms of day,
And men he taught the heavenly way. . . .
The earthly Seer! the heavenly Seer!
I love to dwell on his memory dear;
The chosen of God and the friend of man,
He brought the priesthood back again;
He gazed on the past and the future, too,
And opened . . . the heavenly world to view.1
Looking back, I think I can say that it was while I was learning to play that number and hearing my Grandfather Baugh sing the words that I felt the first feelings of a testimony in my heart concerning the life and mission of Joseph Smith. However, for many years I was puzzled as to why the text referred to Joseph Smith as a seer, a title I was not altogether familiar with. It was not until I read the Book of Mormon that I learned that perhaps the greatest designation Joseph Smith could have been given was that of a seer.

It’s always a thrill to be in the Marriott Center. I wish it were possible for us to be in each of your individual locations, seeing you personally and being able to shake your hands. We haven’t figured out a way to do that yet, but we send our love and greeting to all of you wherever you are in the world. In spite of the vastness of our global audience, we hope all of you are individually able to feel the love we have for you tonight and that each of you can gain something from our message that is applicable in your personal lives.
The Prophet in Liberty Jail
One of the great blessings of our assignments as General Authorities is the chance to visit members of the Church in various locations around the world and to glean from the history that our members have experienced across the globe. In that spirit I wish to share with you tonight some feelings that came to me during a Church assignment I had last spring when I was assigned to visit the Platte City stake in western Missouri, here in the United States.
The Platte City Missouri Stake lies adjacent to the Liberty Missouri Stake, now a very famous location in Church history encompassing several important Church history sites, including the ironically named Liberty Jail. From your study of Church history, you will all know something of the experience the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brethren had while imprisoned in that facility during the winter of 1838–39. This was a terribly difficult time in our history for the Church generally and certainly for the Prophet Joseph himself, who bore the brunt of the persecution in that period. Indeed, I daresay that until his martyrdom five and a half years later, there was no more burdensome time in Joseph’s life than this cruel, illegal, and unjustified incarceration in Liberty Jail.
Time does not permit a detailed discussion of the experiences that led up to this moment in Church history, but suffice it to say that problems of various kinds had been building ever since the Prophet Joseph had received a revelation in July of 1831 designating Missouri as the place “consecrated for the gathering of the saints” and the building up of “the city of Zion” (D&amp;C 57:1, 2). By October of 1838, all-out war seemed inevitable between Mormon and non-Mormon forces confronting each other over these issues. After being driven from several of the counties in the western part of that state and under the presumption they had been invited to discuss ways of defusing the volatile situation that had developed, five leaders of the Church, including the Prophet Joseph, marching under a flag of truce, approached the camp of the Missouri militia near the small settlement of Far West, located in Caldwell County.
As it turned out, the flag of truce was meaningless, and the Church leaders </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Several weeks ago I received an e-mail from someone who identified himself as a BYU student doing a research paper on the Prophet Joseph Smith. He asked, “Would you be kind enough to share with me what you feel the impact of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon on the world has been?”
This was an important question, so I took time framing my reply. I wrote, “It was big.”
However, upon reflection, I decided against sending that e-mail. I didn’t want to do most of his work for him. I thought perhaps I would now revisit that question in a little more depth.
A few months back I was visiting with a foreign scholar of religion who had a related question for me: “To what do you attribute the remarkable growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?”
Many people have been asking this question for a few years now. The bicentennial of the Prophet’s birth has given many scholars an opportunity to ask these and similar questions in formal settings: at symposia hosted by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.; by the New South Wales Parliament in Sydney, Australia; and by the National University of Taiwan in Taipei.
When Joseph Smith was just a boy of 17, he said an angel appeared to him and declared “that [his] name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.”1 This year in particular has seen that prediction borne out. Secular scholars and Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and presumed atheists—in many nations and in many tongues—speak good of Joseph’s name.
In Sydney, Dr. Kazi Islam, a Muslim and chair of the Department of World Religions, Dhaka University, Bangladesh, explained that he introduced Mormonism as a compulsory part of the master’s degree in his department “because of [his] profound love and respect for the ideals” of that tradition Joseph Smith founded.2
Dr. Jason Lase, a director general in the Indonesian Department of Religious Affairs, affirmed his belief that Joseph Smith was “a modern religious genius” who created what he called “one of the most stable and well-organized religious organizations” he has ever known.3
A few months later, Arun Joshi, a Hindu journalist from India, gave a remarkable talk at the Taipei conference in which he related the experience of the First Vision to the conflicts in Kashmir and the Middle East, concluding, “The message of Joseph Smith is more relevant . . . today than ever before.”4
These are surely exciting developments, and it can be heady stuff for members of a previously marginalized religion of modest size to find their faith and founder the subject of symposia, celebration, and scholarly interest. Some have even predicted a new world religion will emerge out of these accelerating developments. As that researcher had asked me at a conference,</span>
