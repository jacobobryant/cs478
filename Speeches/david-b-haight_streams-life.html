  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="This joyous season that brings us Thanksgiving and Christmas is the best time of the year when we think of families, loved ones everywhere, and things of the heart.

I have prayed for divine guidance that these few precious moments might be beneficial to all. I am mindful of my responsibility as well as my desire to encourage you in your own &lt;i&gt;personal lives&lt;/i&gt; to follow the course of our Savior unto salvation.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spreading the Word&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It is not possible here to explore or examine the vast realm of revealed gospel knowledge about our mortal existence available to you at this unusual university. And so, on this day, I bring you not an argument or a doubt, but a witness of heaven-sent revelations that this is the church of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these latter days; that God our Heavenly Father lives and that he loves each of us—his children; that Jesus &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the Christ, the son of the living God, our Savior.

The heavenly event related by young Joseph, then only four or five years &lt;i&gt;younger&lt;/i&gt; than most of you, after he came out of a grove of trees—which we appropriately refer to as the “Sacred Grove”—&lt;i&gt;is true&lt;/i&gt;. I bear this witness and testimony to you. Joseph Smith was directed, after scripture study and prayer, to pray for guidance; and he did see and communicate with God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. This church is led today by his prophet, upon whom the Almighty has bestowed the greatest gifts that mortal man is capable of receiving, even our prophet Ezra Taft Benson. I am a witness to the bestowal of the authority and the gifts upon President Benson.

A few days ago, a most unusual news article about the Mormons appeared in the Sunday magazine section of the &lt;i&gt;London Times,&lt;/i&gt; one of the most influential newspapers in the world with one of the widest circulations in the world—one million, three hundred thousand copies (ten times the circulation of Utah’s largest newspaper!). As I studied this rather remarkable article, because it is so favorable and positive about us, I reflected upon the promise and direction our Lord gave twenty-six-year-old Joseph Smith at the Johnson farmhouse in November 1831. Joseph was instructed to translate the Book of Mormon and promised he would be given the “power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&amp;amp;C 1:30).

In my lifetime I have been permitted to witness events, to see and feel divine influences of the Lord in his providence, revealing his gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost. Imagine the stretch of events from the humble but heavenly directed proceedings of the restoration of the gospel to this publication in the &lt;i&gt;London Times&lt;/i&gt;! We had nothing directly to do with the article, but the press and the British Broadcasting Corporation were conscious of and involved this past summer in our 150&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary celebration of our first missionaries arriving in Great Britain. The interest developed by writers for the &lt;i&gt;London Times&lt;/i&gt;resulted in this most complimentary article about our growth and message, and it was written by a nonmember. Well, unusual things are happening all over the world to bring the message of the Restoration to every nation and every people, to tell everyone of the divine Sonship of the Lord Jesus.

&lt;i&gt;That faith also might increase in the earth;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That mine everlasting covenant might be established;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 1:21–23]

You who attend this university have such unusual opportunities and blessings available to you. Every facet of your lives should be enriched by what you do, how you govern your lives, and what you learn while here. I urge you to take full advantage of every uplifting aspect of university life—spiritually, academically, socially, and physically—to feed your souls as well as your minds.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streams, Clear and Pure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Someone has likened each of our lives to a mighty river as it flows to the sea. It is the product of many streams—some large, some small—even little brooks, created by the melting snow high in the mountains. I thank God for the streams, clear and pure, that have influenced my life; for noble parents who taught me the goodness of life, of honor and virtue, and who taught me to love the Lord; for my widowed mother who, like the Prophet Joseph Smith, taught correct principles with understanding and patience; for the priesthood and for the activities of Scouting; for the desire I had to go to college; and for the blessing of finding my sweetheart (I knew when I first saw her that she would be my eternal companion, if I could only convince her to feel the same way I did.); for the blessing of our three children and their posterity, three of whom are here today. My gratitude for the many, many streams and rivers that have affected my life goes on and on. I’m so grateful!

Each stream has a beginning, a source from which it springs. Yours has emerged and developed from sources such as parents, home, family training, early schooling, and the many, many people who have touched your lives. Soon you will be moving out into the world on your own with the necessity and hoped-for ability to make your own way. You are at junctions in your lives, or nearing them, where your stream may take you on to great heights or not so high, to joy and happiness or regret and disappointment. I urge you to use your time wisely, to stretch your intellect and expand your horizons, that you may be prepared to fulfill your personal role in the restored Church and kingdom and to be all that you can be, using correct principles to contain the waters within the banks of your own personal stream as it flows on a true course toward the high reward of eternal life.

You might say at this point, “Oh, we hear that from you brethren all the time!” So, maybe you do. But we who love you will continue to encourage each of you to determine where you are on the ladder as you climb step by step upward through this testing period, because we, too, have been there.

The Savior taught in the Sermon on the Mount: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Matthew 6:33).

I received a letter this past week from a young father who, with his wife and two children, joined the Church four months ago. He had attended a regional conference of eight stakes that we held in Arizona last month. He wrote: “At the conference I learned of love of God and for my fellowmen. I learned that spiritual acts and a ‘help-thy-neighbor’ attitude will be more valuable than all the riches of the world. I learned to not just wish for higher income &lt;i&gt;but to work&lt;/i&gt; to earn enough for our needs. Some of the time and effort I would normally spend just making more money will go to reading the scriptures and teaching my family the gospel at family home evenings. I realized what I received through . . . baptism might be wasted by not making the proper decisions and effort to earn the blessings of the celestial kingdom.”

I was impressed by this new member and his family and with the fact that after only four months of participation, their “precious faith” was already increasing that they might receive the “precious promises” as declared by the Apostle Peter.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;“This Is Life Eternal”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Several years ago I sat in a little white room in the Los Angeles Temple—a simple, little room with no fancy adornments on the walls. My wife, Ruby, was there by my side. We had one son and his wife there along with our daughter and her new husband. Our other son was kneeling at the altar holding the hand of the young lady he was about to be sealed to.

As I looked around the room, I knew the great moment of my life was there, &lt;i&gt;then,&lt;/i&gt; because all I had that was really important—remember, &lt;i&gt;really important&lt;/i&gt;—was in that room. The bishops and stake presidents had found each member of my family worthy to be in that room.

It is not the number of cars you own or the size of your bank account or the number of cattle you have in the hills, but the eternal values that count. You remember the Lord said something about moth and rust getting through to our worldly possessions (see Matthew 6:20). I knew that the greatest moment in my life was having all of our family in that little white sealing room in the Los Angeles Temple. Each of our children and their companions had participated in the sacred ordinances and ceremonies that pertain to salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of God.

One of the greatest blessings of life is to realize what is truly important in our lives and then work toward that end.

Our Lord and Savior’s prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane that last evening for the souls of all mankind, taking their sins and sufferings upon himself, clearly shows the need for us to know, respect, love, and obey our Eternal Father when he emphasized: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent” (John 17:3).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Living the Ten Commandments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Some years ago, Cecil B. DeMille, producer of the epic film &lt;i&gt;The Ten Commandments,&lt;/i&gt; gave an address in which he discussed the pressing need for making that great film. Many today in this so-called “modern” and materialistic society think these commandments a bit archaic. But our Lord God revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai the great governing principles we all are subject to and by which man will be judged. Moses received these commandments twice—on each occasion written by the finger of the Lord on tablets of stone.

The first commandment:

&lt;i&gt;I AM THE LORD THY GOD. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We do not bow before giant birds of carved granite or wooden idols with stone eyes.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But we have other gods competing with God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We may never have bowed before a calf of gold, but we may still worship gold. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Is there a man or a woman who can honestly say that he has never put his ambitions or his vanity above God? Or worshipped flesh more than God? Or worshipped the blue-white glisten of a fine diamond, or the earthy beat of rock and roll, or even worshipped himself above the worship of God? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;These . . . can . . . enslave us and betray us into modern idolatry.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When I was a boy I thought that referred only to profanity—but far worse than profanity is the use of the Name of God for personal worldly gain, for ambition, for intolerance, for selfish power over other men, or as a righteous cloak for unrighteous deed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We take the Name of God in vain whenever we misuse the power of God or whenever we say to Him, “Not &lt;/i&gt;Thy&lt;i&gt; will, but mine be done.” &lt;/i&gt;[Cecil B. DeMille, quoted in “The Ten Commandments,” &lt;i&gt;Deseret News,&lt;/i&gt; 23 February 1957, Church News section, p. 16]

President Kimball told the story about being in the hospital after one of his operations. He was lying on a gurney that was being wheeled onto an elevator. The floor of the elevator was not flush with the corridor floor, and as the cart moved into the elevator, there was a big bump. President Kimball, just coming out of the anesthetic, heard the orderly take the Lord’s name in vain. This great man said to the orderly, “Oh! Don’t say that! He is my best friend.” The young man apologized and promised to never do it again.

And now to the next commandment:

&lt;i&gt;REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY, TO KEEP IT HOLY fares none too well in the head-long rush of modern living.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Mankind has coined countless . . . slogans about the value of time, but this Commandment reminds us that time belongs to God and that some of it should be set aside for Him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The vital and essential heart of this Commandment is that we cannot remain close to God unless we set aside periods of time as God’s time—periods of rest from the affairs of the world and the body to seek true communion with the Spirit of Truth, in meditation, in prayer.&lt;/i&gt; [Cecil B. DeMille, “The Ten Commandments”]

Students should organize their time so that most studying can be done on weekdays, leaving the Sabbath for worshipful activities. The Lord said, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”

And so it is with all the commandments. Each of God’s laws is essential, but particularly today they are vital in our somewhat confused society. The Lord commanded, “Neither shalt thou commit adultery,” and added in modern revelation, “nor anything like unto it” (see D&amp;amp;C 59:6). The commandments are basic to the gospel and the plan of salvation and are as true and valid and real as the day they were cut into tablets of stone by the finger of God.

Our living the law of the Ten Command-ments is only the beginning—or the foothills—in our climb toward perfection. The Savior told the rich young man who was keeping the basic commandments to sell all his possessions and follow the Master, suggesting he should move up to a higher plane in his quest for eternal life.

Joseph Smith declared, “I teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves” (quoted by John Taylor, &lt;i&gt;JD&lt;/i&gt; 10:57–58). You students have been taught, hopefully, in your homes or through religious associations, correct principles. You also have the unique opportunity to be taught correct principles while here at this university. I hope you learn your lessons well that your streams may become mighty rivers of pure, clear water as they flow into the sea.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Loaf of God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A willingness to serve in the kingdom when and wherever called demonstrates a life of faith and goodness, and is one of those streams in our lives that can so bless not only others but ourselves as well. I was impressed with the remarks of a stake president at a recent stake conference as he was released from his assignment. His remarks were of thankfulness for the opportunity to serve his stake and for the way the people served each other. He said:

&lt;i&gt;My service has been out . . . for all to see. But think of the many auxiliary and other leaders and individual members of the Church who have at the same time quietly done their duty and been faithful to the Lord. Some of the greatest service rendered while I have been your president has been done silently out of great sacrifice by individual members. Theirs is the widow’s mite. Theirs is the blessing of true service.&lt;/i&gt;

The president remembered his ancestry, his parents, his children, his business partner, his professional secretaries, members of his high council, stake clerks, and secretaries. And then he stated: “I would not have been able to serve a single week without the help, love, and support of my dear wife.”

In tribute to the bishops, branch presidents, and other leaders, he said, “They serve where the tire hits the road. They have been faithful and loyal to me, as well as to the Lord.”

The president expressed appreciation for his counselors, and for one in particular who declared to him, “You may not wear the hair shirt”—meaning the stake president was never to feel guilty. He had been called by the Lord and was not to feel guilty for difficult decisions that only he could make.

He told of looking in the mirror the day after October general conference and seeing in his mind’s eye the hands of God, kneading the bread dough of his kingdom, and folding him (the stake president) back into the general loaf of the kingdom of God. “Mine,” he said, “was a time to rise for a moment, but now I would become part of the general membership again, as a brother in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so other lives will now be blessed and raised, for the good of the loaf of God.”

What a wonderful attitude!—a stake president demonstrating and teaching how we believe and pray and study the scriptures, earn our livelihood, and serve our God with love. His life’s stream is right on course.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Is It With Thee?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Lord wants and needs all of you to be strong, to be believers, to be examples of goodness to all the world. You can become mighty rivers, flowing with truth. Mediocrity and weaklings come with little effort. The world has an abundance of them.

I would urge you to use your time wisely. Don’t waste it on frivolous pursuits. As Ted Koppel, a national newscaster, told the graduates of Duke University last spring:

[We] &lt;i&gt;can partake of&lt;/i&gt; [TV’s] &lt;i&gt;daily banquet without drawing on any intellectual resources; without either physical or moral discipline. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . In the place of Truth we have discovered facts; for moral absolutes we have substituted moral ambiguity. We now communicate with everyone . . . and say absolutely nothing.&lt;/i&gt; [Commencement speech given by Ted Koppel at Duke University on Sunday, 10 May 1987, pp. 5–6]

I admonish you to live so you can ask for the personal revelation you are entitled to. Someone has written, “Souls are not saved in bundles—they are saved individually. The Spirit says, ‘How is it with thee—thee personally?’”

How &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; things with &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; personally? How are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; doing?

To help evaluate how you are doing, I will pose some questions to give you a greater understanding of exactly who you are and what your potential may be, and then respond with answers from the scriptures, which hold and bear record of truth.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who Are You?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
You are a literal spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents.

&lt;i&gt;Genesis 1:27:&lt;/i&gt; “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female.”

&lt;i&gt;Romans 8:16:&lt;/i&gt; Paul said, “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where Did You Come From?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Your spirit body came from your heavenly parents. Your spirit lived in the presence of celestial beings, whose exalted glory is like unto the sun in comparison with the moon and stars.

&lt;i&gt;Ecclesiastes 12:7:&lt;/i&gt; “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Are You Here?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
You are here because you kept your first estate. You are here to be proved and tested, to show you can keep your second estate by making right choices and being faithful to them.

&lt;i&gt;Abraham 3:25–26:&lt;/i&gt; “And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”

“And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.”

&lt;i&gt;D&amp;amp;C 98:11, 15:&lt;/i&gt; “And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall . . . live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.”

“For I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.”

You are here to develop the gifts and talents to which you were born heir. You will also have the opportunity to gain additional talents.

&lt;i&gt;D&amp;amp;C 82:18:&lt;/i&gt; “And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord’s storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church.”

You are here to sow good works and lay up treasures in heaven.

&lt;i&gt;D&amp;amp;C 11:7:&lt;/i&gt; “Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.”

You are here to meet the requirements and complete the ordinances to become an heir of celestial glory.

&lt;i&gt;D&amp;amp;C 124:38–39:&lt;/i&gt; “For this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was.”

“Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies . . . are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.”

To become an &lt;i&gt;heir of celestial glory&lt;/i&gt; there are requirements that must be met. You are to be sealed to your companion for time and all eternity. You are to work out your exaltation and be of assistance to others. You are to learn to use the body to accomplish spiritual objectives and to obey the law of procreation. You are to strive for perfection and receive a fullness of joy.

With your understanding of truth:

&lt;i&gt;You have power to do many things of your own free will and choice and to glorify his holy name (D&amp;amp;C 58:26–27)&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;You have the power of prayer (see D&amp;amp;C 93:49).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You have power over Satan (D&amp;amp;C 10:5).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You have the power of forgiveness (D&amp;amp;C 82:1).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You have the power of the Holy Ghost (2 Nephi 33:1).&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It is within your power to discipline all your appetites and inclinations. (D&amp;amp;C 50:35)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You have the power to choose your destiny; to inherit the celestial or the terrestrial or the telestial kingdom (D&amp;amp;C 58:28, 88:22–24).&lt;/i&gt;

[Adapted from Thomas C. Byrne, &lt;i&gt;Discover Your Divine Self-Esteem&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: Hawkes Publishing, Inc., 1985), pp. 100–121]

I pray that God will bless you to rise to the heights that can be yours, that you will magnify the opportunities that come into your lives. May each of you be blessed. May the streams of your lives lead you toward the ultimate goal of life everlasting in the celestial kingdom of God our Heavenly Father. We love you and leave our blessings, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>This joyous season that brings us Thanksgiving and Christmas is the best time of the year when we think of families, loved ones everywhere, and things of the heart.</p>
<p>I have prayed for divine guidance that these few precious moments might be beneficial to all. I am mindful of my responsibility as well as my desire to encourage you in your own <i>personal lives</i> to follow the course of our Savior unto salvation.</p>
<h2><b>Spreading the Word</b></h2>
<p>It is not possible here to explore or examine the vast realm of revealed gospel knowledge about our mortal existence available to you at this unusual university. And so, on this day, I bring you not an argument or a doubt, but a witness of heaven-sent revelations that this is the church of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these latter days; that God our Heavenly Father lives and that he loves each of us—his children; that Jesus <i>is</i> the Christ, the son of the living God, our Savior.</p>
<p>The heavenly event related by young Joseph, then only four or five years <i>younger</i> than most of you, after he came out of a grove of trees—which we appropriately refer to as the “Sacred Grove”—<i>is true</i>. I bear this witness and testimony to you. Joseph Smith was directed, after scripture study and prayer, to pray for guidance; and he did see and communicate with God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. This church is led today by his prophet, upon whom the Almighty has bestowed the greatest gifts that mortal man is capable of receiving, even our prophet Ezra Taft Benson. I am a witness to the bestowal of the authority and the gifts upon President Benson.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a most unusual news article about the Mormons appeared in the Sunday magazine section of the <i>London Times,</i> one of the most influential newspapers in the world with one of the widest circulations in the world—one million, three hundred thousand copies (ten times the circulation of Utah’s largest newspaper!). As I studied this rather remarkable article, because it is so favorable and positive about us, I reflected upon the promise and direction our Lord gave twenty-six-year-old Joseph Smith at the Johnson farmhouse in November 1831. Joseph was instructed to translate the Book of Mormon and promised he would be given the “power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (D&amp;C 1:30).</p>
<p>In my lifetime I have been permitted to witness events, to see and feel divine influences of the Lord in his providence, revealing his gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost. Imagine the stretch of events from the humble but heavenly directed proceedings of the restoration of the gospel to this publication in the <i>London Times</i>! We had nothing directly to do with the article, but the press and the British Broadcasting Corporation were conscious of and involved this past summer in our 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration of our first missionaries arriving in Great Britain. The interest developed by writers for the <i>London Times</i>resulted in this most complimentary article about our growth and message, and it was written by a nonmember. Well, unusual things are happening all over the world to bring the message of the Restoration to every nation and every people, to tell everyone of the divine Sonship of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i></p>
<p><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</i></p>
<p><i>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</i> [D&amp;C 1:21–23]</p>
<p>You who attend this university have such unusual opportunities and blessings available to you. Every facet of your lives should be enriched by what you do, how you govern your lives, and what you learn while here. I urge you to take full advantage of every uplifting aspect of university life—spiritually, academically, socially, and physically—to feed your souls as well as your minds.</p>
<h2><b>Streams, Clear and Pure</b></h2>
<p>Someone has likened each of our lives to a mighty river as it flows to the sea. It is the product of many streams—some large, some small—even little brooks, created by the melting snow high in the mountains. I thank God for the streams, clear and pure, that have influenced my life; for noble parents who taught me the goodness of life, of honor and virtue, and who taught me to love the Lord; for my widowed mother who, like the Prophet Joseph Smith, taught correct principles with understanding and patience; for the priesthood and for the activities of Scouting; for the desire I had to go to college; and for the blessing of finding my sweetheart (I knew when I first saw her that she would be my eternal companion, if I could only convince her to feel the same way I did.); for the blessing of our three children and their posterity, three of whom are here today. My gratitude for the many, many streams and rivers that have affected my life goes on and on. I’m so grateful!</p>
<p>Each stream has a beginning, a source from which it springs. Yours has emerged and developed from sources such as parents, home, family training, early schooling, and the many, many people who have touched your lives. Soon you will be moving out into the world on your own with the necessity and hoped-for ability to make your own way. You are at junctions in your lives, or nearing them, where your stream may take you on to great heights or not so high, to joy and happiness or regret and disappointment. I urge you to use your time wisely, to stretch your intellect and expand your horizons, that you may be prepared to fulfill your personal role in the restored Church and kingdom and to be all that you can be, using correct principles to contain the waters within the banks of your own personal stream as it flows on a true course toward the high reward of eternal life.</p>
<p>You might say at this point, “Oh, we hear that from you brethren all the time!” So, maybe you do. But we who love you will continue to encourage each of you to determine where you are on the ladder as you climb step by step upward through this testing period, because we, too, have been there.</p>
<p>The Savior taught in the Sermon on the Mount: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Matthew 6:33).</p>
<p>I received a letter this past week from a young father who, with his wife and two children, joined the Church four months ago. He had attended a regional conference of eight stakes that we held in Arizona last month. He wrote: “At the conference I learned of love of God and for my fellowmen. I learned that spiritual acts and a ‘help-thy-neighbor’ attitude will be more valuable than all the riches of the world. I learned to not just wish for higher income <i>but to work</i> to earn enough for our needs. Some of the time and effort I would normally spend just making more money will go to reading the scriptures and teaching my family the gospel at family home evenings. I realized what I received through . . . baptism might be wasted by not making the proper decisions and effort to earn the blessings of the celestial kingdom.”</p>
<p>I was impressed by this new member and his family and with the fact that after only four months of participation, their “precious faith” was already increasing that they might receive the “precious promises” as declared by the Apostle Peter.</p>
<h2><b>“This Is Life Eternal”</b></h2>
<p>Several years ago I sat in a little white room in the Los Angeles Temple—a simple, little room with no fancy adornments on the walls. My wife, Ruby, was there by my side. We had one son and his wife there along with our daughter and her new husband. Our other son was kneeling at the altar holding the hand of the young lady he was about to be sealed to.</p>
<p>As I looked around the room, I knew the great moment of my life was there, <i>then,</i> because all I had that was really important—remember, <i>really important</i>—was in that room. The bishops and stake presidents had found each member of my family worthy to be in that room.</p>
<p>It is not the number of cars you own or the size of your bank account or the number of cattle you have in the hills, but the eternal values that count. You remember the Lord said something about moth and rust getting through to our worldly possessions (see Matthew 6:20). I knew that the greatest moment in my life was having all of our family in that little white sealing room in the Los Angeles Temple. Each of our children and their companions had participated in the sacred ordinances and ceremonies that pertain to salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>One of the greatest blessings of life is to realize what is truly important in our lives and then work toward that end.</p>
<p>Our Lord and Savior’s prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane that last evening for the souls of all mankind, taking their sins and sufferings upon himself, clearly shows the need for us to know, respect, love, and obey our Eternal Father when he emphasized: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent” (John 17:3).</p>
<h2><b>Living the Ten Commandments</b></h2>
<p>Some years ago, Cecil B. DeMille, producer of the epic film <i>The Ten Commandments,</i> gave an address in which he discussed the pressing need for making that great film. Many today in this so-called “modern” and materialistic society think these commandments a bit archaic. But our Lord God revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai the great governing principles we all are subject to and by which man will be judged. Moses received these commandments twice—on each occasion written by the finger of the Lord on tablets of stone.</p>
<p>The first commandment:</p>
<p><i>I AM THE LORD THY GOD. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.</i></p>
<p><i>We do not bow before giant birds of carved granite or wooden idols with stone eyes.</i></p>
<p><i>But we have other gods competing with God.</i></p>
<p><i>We may never have bowed before a calf of gold, but we may still worship gold. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Is there a man or a woman who can honestly say that he has never put his ambitions or his vanity above God? Or worshipped flesh more than God? Or worshipped the blue-white glisten of a fine diamond, or the earthy beat of rock and roll, or even worshipped himself above the worship of God? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>These . . . can . . . enslave us and betray us into modern idolatry.</i></p>
<p><i>THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN.</i></p>
<p><i>When I was a boy I thought that referred only to profanity—but far worse than profanity is the use of the Name of God for personal worldly gain, for ambition, for intolerance, for selfish power over other men, or as a righteous cloak for unrighteous deed.</i></p>
<p><i>We take the Name of God in vain whenever we misuse the power of God or whenever we say to Him, “Not </i>Thy<i> will, but mine be done.” </i>[Cecil B. DeMille, quoted in “The Ten Commandments,” <i>Deseret News,</i> 23 February 1957, Church News section, p. 16]</p>
<p>President Kimball told the story about being in the hospital after one of his operations. He was lying on a gurney that was being wheeled onto an elevator. The floor of the elevator was not flush with the corridor floor, and as the cart moved into the elevator, there was a big bump. President Kimball, just coming out of the anesthetic, heard the orderly take the Lord’s name in vain. This great man said to the orderly, “Oh! Don’t say that! He is my best friend.” The young man apologized and promised to never do it again.</p>
<p>And now to the next commandment:</p>
<p><i>REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY, TO KEEP IT HOLY fares none too well in the head-long rush of modern living.</i></p>
<p><i>Mankind has coined countless . . . slogans about the value of time, but this Commandment reminds us that time belongs to God and that some of it should be set aside for Him.</i></p>
<p><i>The vital and essential heart of this Commandment is that we cannot remain close to God unless we set aside periods of time as God’s time—periods of rest from the affairs of the world and the body to seek true communion with the Spirit of Truth, in meditation, in prayer.</i> [Cecil B. DeMille, “The Ten Commandments”]</p>
<p>Students should organize their time so that most studying can be done on weekdays, leaving the Sabbath for worshipful activities. The Lord said, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”</p>
<p>And so it is with all the commandments. Each of God’s laws is essential, but particularly today they are vital in our somewhat confused society. The Lord commanded, “Neither shalt thou commit adultery,” and added in modern revelation, “nor anything like unto it” (see D&amp;C 59:6). The commandments are basic to the gospel and the plan of salvation and are as true and valid and real as the day they were cut into tablets of stone by the finger of God.</p>
<p>Our living the law of the Ten Command-ments is only the beginning—or the foothills—in our climb toward perfection. The Savior told the rich young man who was keeping the basic commandments to sell all his possessions and follow the Master, suggesting he should move up to a higher plane in his quest for eternal life.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith declared, “I teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves” (quoted by John Taylor, <i>JD</i> 10:57–58). You students have been taught, hopefully, in your homes or through religious associations, correct principles. You also have the unique opportunity to be taught correct principles while here at this university. I hope you learn your lessons well that your streams may become mighty rivers of pure, clear water as they flow into the sea.</p>
<h2><b>The Loaf of God</b></h2>
<p>A willingness to serve in the kingdom when and wherever called demonstrates a life of faith and goodness, and is one of those streams in our lives that can so bless not only others but ourselves as well. I was impressed with the remarks of a stake president at a recent stake conference as he was released from his assignment. His remarks were of thankfulness for the opportunity to serve his stake and for the way the people served each other. He said:</p>
<p><i>My service has been out . . . for all to see. But think of the many auxiliary and other leaders and individual members of the Church who have at the same time quietly done their duty and been faithful to the Lord. Some of the greatest service rendered while I have been your president has been done silently out of great sacrifice by individual members. Theirs is the widow’s mite. Theirs is the blessing of true service.</i></p>
<p>The president remembered his ancestry, his parents, his children, his business partner, his professional secretaries, members of his high council, stake clerks, and secretaries. And then he stated: “I would not have been able to serve a single week without the help, love, and support of my dear wife.”</p>
<p>In tribute to the bishops, branch presidents, and other leaders, he said, “They serve where the tire hits the road. They have been faithful and loyal to me, as well as to the Lord.”</p>
<p>The president expressed appreciation for his counselors, and for one in particular who declared to him, “You may not wear the hair shirt”—meaning the stake president was never to feel guilty. He had been called by the Lord and was not to feel guilty for difficult decisions that only he could make.</p>
<p>He told of looking in the mirror the day after October general conference and seeing in his mind’s eye the hands of God, kneading the bread dough of his kingdom, and folding him (the stake president) back into the general loaf of the kingdom of God. “Mine,” he said, “was a time to rise for a moment, but now I would become part of the general membership again, as a brother in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so other lives will now be blessed and raised, for the good of the loaf of God.”</p>
<p>What a wonderful attitude!—a stake president demonstrating and teaching how we believe and pray and study the scriptures, earn our livelihood, and serve our God with love. His life’s stream is right on course.</p>
<h2><b>How Is It With Thee?</b></h2>
<p>The Lord wants and needs all of you to be strong, to be believers, to be examples of goodness to all the world. You can become mighty rivers, flowing with truth. Mediocrity and weaklings come with little effort. The world has an abundance of them.</p>
<p>I would urge you to use your time wisely. Don’t waste it on frivolous pursuits. As Ted Koppel, a national newscaster, told the graduates of Duke University last spring:</p>
<p>[We] <i>can partake of</i> [TV’s] <i>daily banquet without drawing on any intellectual resources; without either physical or moral discipline. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . In the place of Truth we have discovered facts; for moral absolutes we have substituted moral ambiguity. We now communicate with everyone . . . and say absolutely nothing.</i> [Commencement speech given by Ted Koppel at Duke University on Sunday, 10 May 1987, pp. 5–6]</p>
<p>I admonish you to live so you can ask for the personal revelation you are entitled to. Someone has written, “Souls are not saved in bundles—they are saved individually. The Spirit says, ‘How is it with thee—thee personally?’”</p>
<p>How <i>are</i> things with <i>you</i> personally? How are <i>you</i> doing?</p>
<p>To help evaluate how you are doing, I will pose some questions to give you a greater understanding of exactly who you are and what your potential may be, and then respond with answers from the scriptures, which hold and bear record of truth.</p>
<h2><b>Who Are You?</b></h2>
<p>You are a literal spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents.</p>
<p><i>Genesis 1:27:</i> “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female.”</p>
<p><i>Romans 8:16:</i> Paul said, “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.”</p>
<h2><b>Where Did You Come From?</b></h2>
<p>Your spirit body came from your heavenly parents. Your spirit lived in the presence of celestial beings, whose exalted glory is like unto the sun in comparison with the moon and stars.</p>
<p><i>Ecclesiastes 12:7:</i> “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.”</p>
<h2><b>Why Are You Here?</b></h2>
<p>You are here because you kept your first estate. You are here to be proved and tested, to show you can keep your second estate by making right choices and being faithful to them.</p>
<p><i>Abraham 3:25–26:</i> “And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”</p>
<p>“And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.”</p>
<p><i>D&amp;C 98:11, 15:</i> “And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall . . . live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.”</p>
<p>“For I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.”</p>
<p>You are here to develop the gifts and talents to which you were born heir. You will also have the opportunity to gain additional talents.</p>
<p><i>D&amp;C 82:18:</i> “And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord’s storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church.”</p>
<p>You are here to sow good works and lay up treasures in heaven.</p>
<p><i>D&amp;C 11:7:</i> “Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.”</p>
<p>You are here to meet the requirements and complete the ordinances to become an heir of celestial glory.</p>
<p><i>D&amp;C 124:38–39:</i> “For this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was.”</p>
<p>“Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies . . . are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.”</p>
<p>To become an <i>heir of celestial glory</i> there are requirements that must be met. You are to be sealed to your companion for time and all eternity. You are to work out your exaltation and be of assistance to others. You are to learn to use the body to accomplish spiritual objectives and to obey the law of procreation. You are to strive for perfection and receive a fullness of joy.</p>
<p>With your understanding of truth:</p>
<p><i>You have power to do many things of your own free will and choice and to glorify his holy name (D&amp;C 58:26–27)</i>.</p>
<p><i>You have the power of prayer (see D&amp;C 93:49).</i></p>
<p><i>You have power over Satan (D&amp;C 10:5).</i></p>
<p><i>You have the power of forgiveness (D&amp;C 82:1).</i></p>
<p><i>You have the power of the Holy Ghost (2 Nephi 33:1).</i></p>
<p><i>It is within your power to discipline all your appetites and inclinations. (D&amp;C 50:35)</i></p>
<p><i>You have the power to choose your destiny; to inherit the celestial or the terrestrial or the telestial kingdom (D&amp;C 58:28, 88:22–24).</i></p>
<p>[Adapted from Thomas C. Byrne, <i>Discover Your Divine Self-Esteem</i> (Salt Lake City: Hawkes Publishing, Inc., 1985), pp. 100–121]</p>
<p>I pray that God will bless you to rise to the heights that can be yours, that you will magnify the opportunities that come into your lives. May each of you be blessed. May the streams of your lives lead you toward the ultimate goal of life everlasting in the celestial kingdom of God our Heavenly Father. We love you and leave our blessings, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your ­family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on—and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy—one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of God’s plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch—choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.2
With this gift of time, you won’t always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what ­happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Deter­mine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We can’t refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, ­faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of “outstanding life and contribution to society and the world.”
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, “With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor.”
Then my daughter exclaimed, “What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!”
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xi’an Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, “Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well.” Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer—now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater—in Chinese, “the mother school.”
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, “As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them.”
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto “Go forth to serve” has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, “go forth to serve” could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of one’s undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you—graduates, parents, and other supporters—thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: “Wow! So how do those fit together?” In some ways they don’t. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests—like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didn’t know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: “Believe in yourself as I believe in you.” It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together (“Believe in Yourself,” The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
