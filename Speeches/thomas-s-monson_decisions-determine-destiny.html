  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="You are a glorious group, even a chosen generation, assembled both here in the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University and in many other locations. It is an honor for me to be with you, and I want you to know that there is nowhere else on earth I would rather be this evening.

I approach this assignment after earnest personal prayer. I seek your faith; I ask for your prayers.

As I look at you assembled here and contemplate those of you who are assembled elsewhere, my thoughts turn to your parents. For many years it was my privilege nearly every week to attend stake conferences and to be in the home of a stake president or a counselor to a stake president. Sometimes, rather interesting things would occur. There were occasions when a tiny brother or sister, not knowing that Mother and Dad had given their bedroom and their bed to a General Authority, would creep in the bedroom early in the morning and think that he or she was crawling into bed with Mother and Father - only to be amazed and confused to find that such was not the case.

On one occasion many years ago, while visiting the Indianapolis Stake, I remember President Lowe, who was with Purdue University there, saying to me, "Brother Monson, would you like to come out to my home and stay with us Saturday evening, or would you prefer to forego the 40-mile drive and stay here with my counselor in Indianapolis?"

I responded, "Well, President Lowe, its late at night, and, if its all the same to you, Ill stay with your counselor here in Indianapolis."

The next morning President Lowe greeted me at eight oclock and said, "Brother Monson, you made an inspired decision."

I asked, "Hows that?"

"Well," he replied, "we have a son away attending the university, and our anticipation was that we, of course, would have you occupy our bedroom on Saturday evening. But, unknown to us and totally unexpectedly, our son returned home from school at two in the morning, came in the front door, walked up the stairs to our bedroom, turned on the light, and yelled, Surprise!"

Im not certain who would have been more surprised on that occasion had I stayed with the stake president - the student or me! I think its rather a good thing we didnt find out.

Well, my young friends, what a thrilling life awaits you! You may not be a John Cabot, sailing off into the blue with the kings patent to discover new lands, nor a Captain James Cook, whose voyages of discovery carried him to "far away places with strange-sounding names."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; But you can be explorers in spirit, with a mandate to make this world better by discovering improved ways of living and of doing things. The spirit of exploration, whether it be of the surface of the earth, the vastness of space, or the principles of living greatly, includes developing the capacity to face trouble with courage, disappointment with cheerfulness, and triumph with humility.

Many of you are familiar with the musical &lt;i&gt;Fiddler on the Roof.&lt;/i&gt; It is a favorite of mine. One laughs as he observes the old-fashioned father of a Jewish family in Russia attempting to cope with the changing times brought forcibly home to him by his beautiful daughters. With abandon they sing, "Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match." Tevye, the father, sings his reply with "If I Were a Rich Man." Tears come to the viewer as he hears the beautiful strains of "Sunrise, Sunset," and he seems to appreciate Tevyes love for his native village when the cast sings "Anatevka."

The gaiety of the dance, the rhythm of the music, and the excellence of the acting all fade in significance when Tevye speaks what to me becomes the message of the musical. He gathers his lovely daughters to his side, and, in the simplicity of his peasant surroundings, he counsels them as they ponder their future. "Remember," cautions Tevye, "in Anatevka we know who we are and what God expects us to become."

As Latter-day Saints, we know who we are and what God expects us to become. Listen to the truth taught to us in the first book of Moses, called Genesis:

&lt;i&gt;God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And God blessed them.&lt;/i&gt; [Genesis 1:2628]

Created in the image of God. We cannot sincerely hold this conviction without experiencing a profound sense of strength and power. As Latter-day Saints, we know that we lived before we came to earth, that mortality is a probationary period wherein we might prove ourselves obedient to Gods command and thus worthy of celestial glory. Yes, we know who we are and what God expects us to become. Such knowledge, however, does not ensure our success in reaching our goal of eternal life.

During the last half century or so, there has been throughout the world a gradual but continual decline in many phases of life. We observe relationships without morality, science without humanity, knowledge without character, business without ethics, worship without sacrifice, pleasure without conscience, politics without principle, and wealth without works.

Perhaps the renowned author Charles Dickens best described our day when he spoke of a period over two centuries ago. His classic &lt;i&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/i&gt; begins:

&lt;i&gt;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us.&lt;/i&gt;

This is your world. The future is in your hands. The outcome is up to you. The way to exaltation is not a freeway featuring unlimited vision, unrestricted speeds, and untested skills. Rather, it is known by many forks and turnings, sharp curves, and controlled speeds. Your driving skill will be put to the test. Are you ready? You are driving. You havent passed this way before. Fortunately, the Master Highway Builder, even our Heavenly Father, has provided a road map showing the route to follow. He has placed markers along the way to guide you to your destination. Perhaps you may recognize some of His signs:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Honour thy father and thy mother" (Exodus 20:12).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Search the scriptures; for . . . they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;"Be ye clean" (3 Nephi 20:41).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
That evil one too has placed road signs to frustrate your progress and to lead you from the path of truth into detours of sin. His detours all lead to a dead end. Have you noticed his markers?
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Just this once wont matter.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;It cant hurt anyone but me.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;My love is mine to give; my life is mine to live.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Times have changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Now we see coming into focus the responsibility to choose, that inevitable crisis at the crossroads of life. He who would lead you down waits patiently for a dark night, a wavering will, a confused conscience, a mixed-up mind. Are you prepared to make the decisions at the crossroads?

I cant stress too strongly that decisions determine destiny. You cant make eternal decisions without eternal consequences.

May I provide a simple formula by which you can measure the choices which confront you. Its easy to remember, sometimes difficult to apply: You cant be right by doing wrong; you cant be wrong by doing right. Your personal conscience always warns you as a friend before it punishes you as a judge.

The Lord, in a revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet at Kirtland, Ohio, May 1831, counseled:

&lt;i&gt;That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That which is of God is light.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 50:2324]

Some foolish persons turn their backs on the wisdom of God and follow the allurement of fickle fashion, the attraction of false popularity, and the thrill of the moment. Their course of conduct so resembles the disastrous experience of Esau, who exchanged his birthright for a mess of pottage.

To illustrate, may I share with you the results of a survey conducted by a reputable organization and reported in a national magazine.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The survey was entitled, "Would You, for Ten Million Dollars?" Let me ask you the same questions which were asked in the survey:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;For 10 million dollars in cash, would you leave your family permanently?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Would you marry someone you didnt love?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Would you give up all your friends permanently?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Would you serve a years jail term on a framed charge?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Would you take off your clothes in public?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Would you take a dangerous job in which you had a 1-in-10 chance of losing your life?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Would you become a beggar for a year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Of the people polled, 1 percent would leave their families, 10 percent would marry lovelessly, 11 percent would give up friends, 12 percent would undress in public, 13 percent would go to jail for a year, 14 percent would take the risky job, and 21 percent would beg for a year.

Where money, rather than morality, dictates ones actions, one is inclined away from God. Turning away from God brings broken covenants, shattered dreams, vanished ambitions, unfulfilled expectations, crushed hopes, and ruined lives.

Such a quagmire of quicksand I plead with you to avoid. You are of a noble birthright. Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is your goal. Such a goal is not achieved in one glorious attempt but rather is the result of a lifetime of righteousness, an accumulation of wise choices, even a constancy of purpose. Like the coveted A grade on the report card of a difficult and required college course, the reward of eternal life requires effort.

There is a fable told about Euclid and Pharaoh and geometry. It is said that Pharaoh, entranced by some of the explanations and demonstrations of Euclid, wished to learn geometry, and Euclid undertook to teach him. He studied for a brief period and then called in Euclid and said the process was too slow for him. He was a Pharaoh; there must be a shorter road. He did not want to spend all his time to learn geometry. Then Euclid gave voice to this great truth. Said he to his Majesty, "There is no royal road to geometry."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

My young friends, there is no royal road to salvation and exaltation. There is no royal road to success in any endeavor. The A grade is the result of each theme, each quiz, each class, each examination, each term paper. So each heartfelt prayer, each Church meeting attended, each worthy friend, each righteous decision, each act of service performed all precede that goal of eternal life.

A few months ago, as I returned from an assignment in Germany, I gazed out the window of the plane and marveled at the stars by which the navigator charted our course. My thoughts were upon you and the opportunity given me to meet with you tonight. I thought of the truth "Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But . . . you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

What ideals, when followed, will bring to you those blessings you so much seek, even a quiet conscience, a peace-filled heart, a loving family, a contented home?

May I suggest these three:

&lt;i&gt;Choose your friends with caution.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Plan your future with purpose.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Frame your life with faith.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First: Choose Your Friends with Caution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In a survey which was made in selected wards and stakes of the Church, we learned a most significant fact. Those persons whose friends married in the temple usually married in the temple, while those persons whose friends did not marry in the temple usually did not marry in the temple. The influence of ones friends appeared to be a more dominant factor than parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.

We tend to become like those whom we admire. Just as in Nathaniel Hawthornes classic account "The Great Stone Face," we adopt the mannerisms, the attitudes, even the conduct of those whom we admire - and they are usually our friends. Associate with those who, like you, are planning not for temporary convenience, shallow goals, or narrow ambition but rather for those things that matter most - even eternal objectives.

Inscribed on the east transept wall of Stanford University Memorial Church is the truth: "All that is not eternal [is] too short, [and] all that is not infinite [is] too small."&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

Beyond your circle of earthly friends, I urge you to make a friend of your Heavenly Father. He stands ready to answer the prayer of your heart. Being the Father of your spirit and having created you in His own image, knowing the end from the beginning, His wisdom will not fail and His counsel is ever true. Make a friend of Him.

There is another important friend you should have, and that is the bishop of your ward. He has been called of God by prophecy and the laying on of hands by those who are in authority. He is entitled to heavenly help in providing you with counsel and guidance. Make a friend of him.

How well I remember the challenges confronting the youth in the ward over which I once presided as a bishop. One evening a lovely teenage girl came to my office with her boyfriend to talk things over with me. The two of them were very much in love, and temptation was beginning to get the best of them.

As we counseled together, each made a pledge to the other to resist temptation and keep uppermost in their minds the goal of a temple marriage. I suggested a course of action to follow and then felt impressed to say: "If you ever find yourselves in a position of compromise and need additional strength, you call me, regardless of the hour."

One morning at 1:00 a.m., the telephone rang and a voice said: "Bishop, this is Susan. Remember how you asked me to call if I found myself being tempted? Well, Bishop, Im in that situation." I asked where she was, and she described a popular parking spot in the Salt Lake Valley. She and her fiance had walked to a nearby phone booth to make the call. The setting wasnt ideal for providing counsel, but the need was great, and the young couple was receptive.

I wont mention how often Susan called. However, when the mailman delivered her wedding announcement to our home and Sister Monson read, "Mr. and Mrs. Jones request the pleasure of your company at the wedding reception of their daughter, Susan," she sighed, "Thank heaven!" When I noticed the small print at the bottom, which read, "Married in the Salt Lake Temple," I said silently, "Thank heaven for the strength of Latter-day Saint youth."

&lt;i&gt;Choose your friends with caution.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second: Plan Your Future with Purpose&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The great Thomas Carlyle said: "The man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder - a waif, a nothing, a no man. Have a purpose in life, and, having it, throw such strength of mind and muscle into your work as God has given you."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Many years ago I served as a mission president. I had 450 wonderful, dedicated missionaries. When we returned home to Salt Lake City after three years, my dear wife and I were a little surprised one evening as we ran a tally on our missionaries, only to find that there were some sister missionaries who had not as yet found an eternal companion. We determined we would do what we could to help out. I said to Sister Monson, "Frances, lets plan with a purpose and invite three or four of our lovely sister missionaries to our home. Well have an activity where they can tell us who of all the single returned male missionaries they would like to have invited to a little fireside in our home. Then we will show pictures of the mission, and we will arrange the seating so that they can become well acquainted with one another." This was done, and I might say that the four girls whom we invited eagerly responded to the challenge.

In shoe boxes we maintained individual five-by-seven-inch photographs of every missionary. We had four such boxes, with missionary pictures in each. As those four girls sat around our living room, I said to each of them, "Here is a gift. Thumb through your box of pictures and tell me which of all the pictures represents the young man whom you would most like to have invited to come to this fireside." My, that was an interesting scene. I think that the only way I could adequately describe it is to ask a question. Have you ever seen children on Christmas morning? We went forward and invited the chosen four young men to join these four young ladies in our home, and we had a glorious evening. At the conclusion of the evening, I noticed two of them slowly walking down our driveway, and I said to Sister Monson, "This looks promising." They were walking very close together.

It wasnt long afterward that I received a telephone call from the young man. He said, "President Monson, do you remember that I promised you if I ever fell in love, I would let you know?"

I said, "Yes, sir."

He continued, "President, I have fallen in love."

I replied, "Good. With whom?"

He said, "Youll never guess."

I was discreet; I didnt guess. I said, "You tell me." And he named the sister missionary with whom he walked side by side and hand in hand from our party that evening. They have now been married for 42 years and have five children and many grandchildren.

Some of you within the sound of my voice have already married; others are still seeking that special someone with whom you would want to spend eternity. For those of you in the latter category, in your quest for the man or woman of your dreams, you may well heed the counsel given by King Arthur in the musical &lt;i&gt;Camelot.&lt;/i&gt; Faced with a particularly vexing dilemma, King Arthur could well have been speaking to all of us when he declared, "We must not let our passions destroy our dreams."&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; May you follow this most essential counsel. I urge you to hold fast to your standards. I plead with you not to waver.

As a young boy I had a very special Sunday School teacher who has since passed away. Her name was Lucy Gertsch.

Lucy was lovely and ever so sweet. She was deserving of a worthy companion, yet none had come her way. The years flew by and Lucy was becoming resigned to the fact that she would never marry. And then, when she was in her mid-forties, she met Dick. It was a case of love at first sight. Just one problem: Dick was not a member of the Church. Did Lucy succumb to the age-old fallacy of marrying out of desperation, with the fleeting hope that one day he would become a member? Not Lucy. She was wiser than this. She simply told him, "Dick, I think youre wonderful, but we would never be happy dating each other."

"Why not?" he countered.

"Because youre not a Mormon."

"How do I become a Mormon? I want to date you." He studied the gospel. She answered his questions. He gained a testimony and was baptized.

Then he said, "Lucy, now that Im a member, we can be married at last."

Lucy replied, "Oh, Dick, I love you so much. Now that you are a member of the Church, you wouldnt be content with anything but a temple marriage."

"How long will that take, Lucy?"

"About a year, if we meet the other requirements."

One year later Lucy and Dick entered the house of the Lord.

Lucy lived the truth of the verse:

&lt;i&gt;Dare to be a Mormon;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dare to stand alone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dare to have a purpose firm,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And dare to make it known.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Plan your future with purpose.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third: Frame Your Life with Faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Amidst the confusion of the times, the conflicts of conscience, and the turmoil of daily living, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives.

Little children can give us interesting examples of faith. Some time ago I jotted down from one of our national magazines a short compilation of "Childrens Letters to God." I found them most interesting.

Little Mark wrote: "Dear God, I keep waiting for spring but it never [did] come yet. Dont forget."

Another child stated: "Dear God, If you made the rule for kids to take out the garbage please change it."

Little Mickey wrote: "Dear God, If you watch in Church on Sunday I will show you my new shoes."

Jeff wrote: "Dear God, It is great the way you always get the stars in the right places. Why cant you do that with the moon?"

Joyce wrote: "Dear God, Thank you for the baby brother but what I prayed for was a puppy."

I like this one from Matthew the best: "Dear God, I read your book and I like it." Then he asked, "I would like to write a book someday with the same kind of stories. Where do you get your ideas? Best wishes."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

True faith requires determination, and the kind of determination which is required is that set forth by a 21-year-old female college senior, who declared:

&lt;i&gt;Our generation has been exposed, through every means of communication, to major and minor fears - the little threat of not finding a mate if one does not use a certain mouthwash or fear of nonacceptance if one does not succumb to a low moral standard because it is "the nature of the beast."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Many of us accept the premises that "You cant fight city hall" and "Live life to its fullest now, for tomorrow we will be destroyed by nuclear war or some other catastrophe."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I am old-fashioned enough to believe in God; to believe in the dignity and potential of His creature, man; and I am realistic, not idealistic, enough to know that I am not alone in these feelings.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Some say that, unlike other generations, we have no mission in life - that everything has been handed to us. We have not been pampered but spiritually impoverished. I dont want to live in the poverty of affluence - and I cannot live alone.&lt;/i&gt;

Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Be firm in your faith.

I think of an account I read about the wife of one of our early pioneers. Her name was Catherine Curtis Spencer. Her husband, Orson Spencer, was a sensitive, well-educated man. She had been reared in Boston and was cultured and refined. She and Orson had six children. After leaving Nauvoo, her delicate health declined from exposure and hardship. Elder Spencer wrote to her parents and asked if she could return to live with them while he established a home for her in the West. Their reply: "Let her renounce her degrading faith, and she can come back, but never until she does." Sister Spencer would not renounce her faith. When her parents letter was read to her, she asked her husband to get his Bible and read to her from the book of Ruth: "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16). Outside the storm raged, the wagon covers leaked, and friends held milk pans over Sister Spencers head to keep her dry. In these conditions, and without a word of complaint, she closed her eyes for the last time.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

Though we may not necessarily forfeit our lives in service to our God, we can certainly demonstrate our love for Him by how well we serve Him. He who hears our silent prayers, He who observes our unheralded acts will reward us openly when the need comes.

Should doubt knock at your doorway, just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts: "I propose to stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness and contentment are there, and I forbid you, agnostic, doubting thoughts, to destroy the house of my faith. I grant that I cannot explain the miracles of the Bible, and I do not attempt to do so, but I accept Gods word. I wasnt with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through science, and I will not permit so-called science to destroy it. When I change my mind about God and His work, only the inspiration of God will change it."

&lt;i&gt;Frame your life with faith.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;When you choose your friends with caution, plan your future with purpose, and frame your life with faith, you will merit the companionship of the Holy Spirit. You will have a perfect brightness of hope. You will testify through your own experience to the truth of the Lords promise:

&lt;i&gt;I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 76:56]

To these perfect truths I bear my solemn witness and invoke the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>You are a glorious group, even a chosen generation, assembled both here in the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University and in many other locations. It is an honor for me to be with you, and I want you to know that there is nowhere else on earth I would rather be this evening.</p>
<p>I approach this assignment after earnest personal prayer. I seek your faith; I ask for your prayers.</p>
<p>As I look at you assembled here and contemplate those of you who are assembled elsewhere, my thoughts turn to your parents. For many years it was my privilege nearly every week to attend stake conferences and to be in the home of a stake president or a counselor to a stake president. Sometimes, rather interesting things would occur. There were occasions when a tiny brother or sister, not knowing that Mother and Dad had given their bedroom and their bed to a General Authority, would creep in the bedroom early in the morning and think that he or she was crawling into bed with Mother and Father - only to be amazed and confused to find that such was not the case.</p>
<p>On one occasion many years ago, while visiting the Indianapolis Stake, I remember President Lowe, who was with Purdue University there, saying to me, "Brother Monson, would you like to come out to my home and stay with us Saturday evening, or would you prefer to forego the 40-mile drive and stay here with my counselor in Indianapolis?"</p>
<p>I responded, "Well, President Lowe, its late at night, and, if its all the same to you, Ill stay with your counselor here in Indianapolis."</p>
<p>The next morning President Lowe greeted me at eight oclock and said, "Brother Monson, you made an inspired decision."</p>
<p>I asked, "Hows that?"</p>
<p>"Well," he replied, "we have a son away attending the university, and our anticipation was that we, of course, would have you occupy our bedroom on Saturday evening. But, unknown to us and totally unexpectedly, our son returned home from school at two in the morning, came in the front door, walked up the stairs to our bedroom, turned on the light, and yelled, Surprise!"</p>
<p>Im not certain who would have been more surprised on that occasion had I stayed with the stake president - the student or me! I think its rather a good thing we didnt find out.</p>
<p>Well, my young friends, what a thrilling life awaits you! You may not be a John Cabot, sailing off into the blue with the kings patent to discover new lands, nor a Captain James Cook, whose voyages of discovery carried him to "far away places with strange-sounding names."<sup>1</sup> But you can be explorers in spirit, with a mandate to make this world better by discovering improved ways of living and of doing things. The spirit of exploration, whether it be of the surface of the earth, the vastness of space, or the principles of living greatly, includes developing the capacity to face trouble with courage, disappointment with cheerfulness, and triumph with humility.</p>
<p>Many of you are familiar with the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i> It is a favorite of mine. One laughs as he observes the old-fashioned father of a Jewish family in Russia attempting to cope with the changing times brought forcibly home to him by his beautiful daughters. With abandon they sing, "Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match." Tevye, the father, sings his reply with "If I Were a Rich Man." Tears come to the viewer as he hears the beautiful strains of "Sunrise, Sunset," and he seems to appreciate Tevyes love for his native village when the cast sings "Anatevka."</p>
<p>The gaiety of the dance, the rhythm of the music, and the excellence of the acting all fade in significance when Tevye speaks what to me becomes the message of the musical. He gathers his lovely daughters to his side, and, in the simplicity of his peasant surroundings, he counsels them as they ponder their future. "Remember," cautions Tevye, "in Anatevka we know who we are and what God expects us to become."</p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints, we know who we are and what God expects us to become. Listen to the truth taught to us in the first book of Moses, called Genesis:</p>
<p><i>God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</i></p>
<p><i>And God blessed them.</i> [Genesis 1:2628]</p>
<p>Created in the image of God. We cannot sincerely hold this conviction without experiencing a profound sense of strength and power. As Latter-day Saints, we know that we lived before we came to earth, that mortality is a probationary period wherein we might prove ourselves obedient to Gods command and thus worthy of celestial glory. Yes, we know who we are and what God expects us to become. Such knowledge, however, does not ensure our success in reaching our goal of eternal life.</p>
<p>During the last half century or so, there has been throughout the world a gradual but continual decline in many phases of life. We observe relationships without morality, science without humanity, knowledge without character, business without ethics, worship without sacrifice, pleasure without conscience, politics without principle, and wealth without works.</p>
<p>Perhaps the renowned author Charles Dickens best described our day when he spoke of a period over two centuries ago. His classic <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> begins:</p>
<p><i>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us.</i></p>
<p>This is your world. The future is in your hands. The outcome is up to you. The way to exaltation is not a freeway featuring unlimited vision, unrestricted speeds, and untested skills. Rather, it is known by many forks and turnings, sharp curves, and controlled speeds. Your driving skill will be put to the test. Are you ready? You are driving. You havent passed this way before. Fortunately, the Master Highway Builder, even our Heavenly Father, has provided a road map showing the route to follow. He has placed markers along the way to guide you to your destination. Perhaps you may recognize some of His signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Honour thy father and thy mother" (Exodus 20:12).</li>
<li>"Search the scriptures; for . . . they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).</li>
<li>"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).</li>
<li>"Be ye clean" (3 Nephi 20:41).</li>
</ul>
<p>That evil one too has placed road signs to frustrate your progress and to lead you from the path of truth into detours of sin. His detours all lead to a dead end. Have you noticed his markers?</p>
<ul>
<li>Just this once wont matter.</li>
<li>It cant hurt anyone but me.</li>
<li>My love is mine to give; my life is mine to live.</li>
<li>Times have changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we see coming into focus the responsibility to choose, that inevitable crisis at the crossroads of life. He who would lead you down waits patiently for a dark night, a wavering will, a confused conscience, a mixed-up mind. Are you prepared to make the decisions at the crossroads?</p>
<p>I cant stress too strongly that decisions determine destiny. You cant make eternal decisions without eternal consequences.</p>
<p>May I provide a simple formula by which you can measure the choices which confront you. Its easy to remember, sometimes difficult to apply: You cant be right by doing wrong; you cant be wrong by doing right. Your personal conscience always warns you as a friend before it punishes you as a judge.</p>
<p>The Lord, in a revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet at Kirtland, Ohio, May 1831, counseled:</p>
<p><i>That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i></p>
<p><i>That which is of God is light.</i> [D&amp;C 50:2324]</p>
<p>Some foolish persons turn their backs on the wisdom of God and follow the allurement of fickle fashion, the attraction of false popularity, and the thrill of the moment. Their course of conduct so resembles the disastrous experience of Esau, who exchanged his birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
<p>To illustrate, may I share with you the results of a survey conducted by a reputable organization and reported in a national magazine.<sup>2</sup> The survey was entitled, "Would You, for Ten Million Dollars?" Let me ask you the same questions which were asked in the survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 10 million dollars in cash, would you leave your family permanently?</li>
<li>Would you marry someone you didnt love?</li>
<li>Would you give up all your friends permanently?</li>
<li>Would you serve a years jail term on a framed charge?</li>
<li>Would you take off your clothes in public?</li>
<li>Would you take a dangerous job in which you had a 1-in-10 chance of losing your life?</li>
<li>Would you become a beggar for a year?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the people polled, 1 percent would leave their families, 10 percent would marry lovelessly, 11 percent would give up friends, 12 percent would undress in public, 13 percent would go to jail for a year, 14 percent would take the risky job, and 21 percent would beg for a year.</p>
<p>Where money, rather than morality, dictates ones actions, one is inclined away from God. Turning away from God brings broken covenants, shattered dreams, vanished ambitions, unfulfilled expectations, crushed hopes, and ruined lives.</p>
<p>Such a quagmire of quicksand I plead with you to avoid. You are of a noble birthright. Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is your goal. Such a goal is not achieved in one glorious attempt but rather is the result of a lifetime of righteousness, an accumulation of wise choices, even a constancy of purpose. Like the coveted A grade on the report card of a difficult and required college course, the reward of eternal life requires effort.</p>
<p>There is a fable told about Euclid and Pharaoh and geometry. It is said that Pharaoh, entranced by some of the explanations and demonstrations of Euclid, wished to learn geometry, and Euclid undertook to teach him. He studied for a brief period and then called in Euclid and said the process was too slow for him. He was a Pharaoh; there must be a shorter road. He did not want to spend all his time to learn geometry. Then Euclid gave voice to this great truth. Said he to his Majesty, "There is no royal road to geometry."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>My young friends, there is no royal road to salvation and exaltation. There is no royal road to success in any endeavor. The A grade is the result of each theme, each quiz, each class, each examination, each term paper. So each heartfelt prayer, each Church meeting attended, each worthy friend, each righteous decision, each act of service performed all precede that goal of eternal life.</p>
<p>A few months ago, as I returned from an assignment in Germany, I gazed out the window of the plane and marveled at the stars by which the navigator charted our course. My thoughts were upon you and the opportunity given me to meet with you tonight. I thought of the truth "Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But . . . you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>What ideals, when followed, will bring to you those blessings you so much seek, even a quiet conscience, a peace-filled heart, a loving family, a contented home?</p>
<p>May I suggest these three:</p>
<p><i>Choose your friends with caution.</i></p>
<p><i>Plan your future with purpose.</i></p>
<p><i>Frame your life with faith.</i></p>
<h2><b>First: Choose Your Friends with Caution</b></h2>
<p>In a survey which was made in selected wards and stakes of the Church, we learned a most significant fact. Those persons whose friends married in the temple usually married in the temple, while those persons whose friends did not marry in the temple usually did not marry in the temple. The influence of ones friends appeared to be a more dominant factor than parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.</p>
<p>We tend to become like those whom we admire. Just as in Nathaniel Hawthornes classic account "The Great Stone Face," we adopt the mannerisms, the attitudes, even the conduct of those whom we admire - and they are usually our friends. Associate with those who, like you, are planning not for temporary convenience, shallow goals, or narrow ambition but rather for those things that matter most - even eternal objectives.</p>
<p>Inscribed on the east transept wall of Stanford University Memorial Church is the truth: "All that is not eternal [is] too short, [and] all that is not infinite [is] too small."<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Beyond your circle of earthly friends, I urge you to make a friend of your Heavenly Father. He stands ready to answer the prayer of your heart. Being the Father of your spirit and having created you in His own image, knowing the end from the beginning, His wisdom will not fail and His counsel is ever true. Make a friend of Him.</p>
<p>There is another important friend you should have, and that is the bishop of your ward. He has been called of God by prophecy and the laying on of hands by those who are in authority. He is entitled to heavenly help in providing you with counsel and guidance. Make a friend of him.</p>
<p>How well I remember the challenges confronting the youth in the ward over which I once presided as a bishop. One evening a lovely teenage girl came to my office with her boyfriend to talk things over with me. The two of them were very much in love, and temptation was beginning to get the best of them.</p>
<p>As we counseled together, each made a pledge to the other to resist temptation and keep uppermost in their minds the goal of a temple marriage. I suggested a course of action to follow and then felt impressed to say: "If you ever find yourselves in a position of compromise and need additional strength, you call me, regardless of the hour."</p>
<p>One morning at 1:00 a.m., the telephone rang and a voice said: "Bishop, this is Susan. Remember how you asked me to call if I found myself being tempted? Well, Bishop, Im in that situation." I asked where she was, and she described a popular parking spot in the Salt Lake Valley. She and her fiance had walked to a nearby phone booth to make the call. The setting wasnt ideal for providing counsel, but the need was great, and the young couple was receptive.</p>
<p>I wont mention how often Susan called. However, when the mailman delivered her wedding announcement to our home and Sister Monson read, "Mr. and Mrs. Jones request the pleasure of your company at the wedding reception of their daughter, Susan," she sighed, "Thank heaven!" When I noticed the small print at the bottom, which read, "Married in the Salt Lake Temple," I said silently, "Thank heaven for the strength of Latter-day Saint youth."</p>
<p><i>Choose your friends with caution.</i></p>
<h2><b>Second: Plan Your Future with Purpose</b></h2>
<p>The great Thomas Carlyle said: "The man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder - a waif, a nothing, a no man. Have a purpose in life, and, having it, throw such strength of mind and muscle into your work as God has given you."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Many years ago I served as a mission president. I had 450 wonderful, dedicated missionaries. When we returned home to Salt Lake City after three years, my dear wife and I were a little surprised one evening as we ran a tally on our missionaries, only to find that there were some sister missionaries who had not as yet found an eternal companion. We determined we would do what we could to help out. I said to Sister Monson, "Frances, lets plan with a purpose and invite three or four of our lovely sister missionaries to our home. Well have an activity where they can tell us who of all the single returned male missionaries they would like to have invited to a little fireside in our home. Then we will show pictures of the mission, and we will arrange the seating so that they can become well acquainted with one another." This was done, and I might say that the four girls whom we invited eagerly responded to the challenge.</p>
<p>In shoe boxes we maintained individual five-by-seven-inch photographs of every missionary. We had four such boxes, with missionary pictures in each. As those four girls sat around our living room, I said to each of them, "Here is a gift. Thumb through your box of pictures and tell me which of all the pictures represents the young man whom you would most like to have invited to come to this fireside." My, that was an interesting scene. I think that the only way I could adequately describe it is to ask a question. Have you ever seen children on Christmas morning? We went forward and invited the chosen four young men to join these four young ladies in our home, and we had a glorious evening. At the conclusion of the evening, I noticed two of them slowly walking down our driveway, and I said to Sister Monson, "This looks promising." They were walking very close together.</p>
<p>It wasnt long afterward that I received a telephone call from the young man. He said, "President Monson, do you remember that I promised you if I ever fell in love, I would let you know?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, sir."</p>
<p>He continued, "President, I have fallen in love."</p>
<p>I replied, "Good. With whom?"</p>
<p>He said, "Youll never guess."</p>
<p>I was discreet; I didnt guess. I said, "You tell me." And he named the sister missionary with whom he walked side by side and hand in hand from our party that evening. They have now been married for 42 years and have five children and many grandchildren.</p>
<p>Some of you within the sound of my voice have already married; others are still seeking that special someone with whom you would want to spend eternity. For those of you in the latter category, in your quest for the man or woman of your dreams, you may well heed the counsel given by King Arthur in the musical <i>Camelot.</i> Faced with a particularly vexing dilemma, King Arthur could well have been speaking to all of us when he declared, "We must not let our passions destroy our dreams."<sup>7</sup> May you follow this most essential counsel. I urge you to hold fast to your standards. I plead with you not to waver.</p>
<p>As a young boy I had a very special Sunday School teacher who has since passed away. Her name was Lucy Gertsch.</p>
<p>Lucy was lovely and ever so sweet. She was deserving of a worthy companion, yet none had come her way. The years flew by and Lucy was becoming resigned to the fact that she would never marry. And then, when she was in her mid-forties, she met Dick. It was a case of love at first sight. Just one problem: Dick was not a member of the Church. Did Lucy succumb to the age-old fallacy of marrying out of desperation, with the fleeting hope that one day he would become a member? Not Lucy. She was wiser than this. She simply told him, "Dick, I think youre wonderful, but we would never be happy dating each other."</p>
<p>"Why not?" he countered.</p>
<p>"Because youre not a Mormon."</p>
<p>"How do I become a Mormon? I want to date you." He studied the gospel. She answered his questions. He gained a testimony and was baptized.</p>
<p>Then he said, "Lucy, now that Im a member, we can be married at last."</p>
<p>Lucy replied, "Oh, Dick, I love you so much. Now that you are a member of the Church, you wouldnt be content with anything but a temple marriage."</p>
<p>"How long will that take, Lucy?"</p>
<p>"About a year, if we meet the other requirements."</p>
<p>One year later Lucy and Dick entered the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>Lucy lived the truth of the verse:</p>
<p><i>Dare to be a Mormon;</i><br />
<i>Dare to stand alone.</i><br />
<i>Dare to have a purpose firm,</i><br />
<i>And dare to make it known.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p><i>Plan your future with purpose.</i></p>
<h2><b>Third: Frame Your Life with Faith</b></h2>
<p>Amidst the confusion of the times, the conflicts of conscience, and the turmoil of daily living, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives.</p>
<p>Little children can give us interesting examples of faith. Some time ago I jotted down from one of our national magazines a short compilation of "Childrens Letters to God." I found them most interesting.</p>
<p>Little Mark wrote: "Dear God, I keep waiting for spring but it never [did] come yet. Dont forget."</p>
<p>Another child stated: "Dear God, If you made the rule for kids to take out the garbage please change it."</p>
<p>Little Mickey wrote: "Dear God, If you watch in Church on Sunday I will show you my new shoes."</p>
<p>Jeff wrote: "Dear God, It is great the way you always get the stars in the right places. Why cant you do that with the moon?"</p>
<p>Joyce wrote: "Dear God, Thank you for the baby brother but what I prayed for was a puppy."</p>
<p>I like this one from Matthew the best: "Dear God, I read your book and I like it." Then he asked, "I would like to write a book someday with the same kind of stories. Where do you get your ideas? Best wishes."<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>True faith requires determination, and the kind of determination which is required is that set forth by a 21-year-old female college senior, who declared:</p>
<p><i>Our generation has been exposed, through every means of communication, to major and minor fears - the little threat of not finding a mate if one does not use a certain mouthwash or fear of nonacceptance if one does not succumb to a low moral standard because it is "the nature of the beast."</i></p>
<p><i>Many of us accept the premises that "You cant fight city hall" and "Live life to its fullest now, for tomorrow we will be destroyed by nuclear war or some other catastrophe."</i></p>
<p><i>I am old-fashioned enough to believe in God; to believe in the dignity and potential of His creature, man; and I am realistic, not idealistic, enough to know that I am not alone in these feelings.</i></p>
<p><i>Some say that, unlike other generations, we have no mission in life - that everything has been handed to us. We have not been pampered but spiritually impoverished. I dont want to live in the poverty of affluence - and I cannot live alone.</i></p>
<p>Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Be firm in your faith.</p>
<p>I think of an account I read about the wife of one of our early pioneers. Her name was Catherine Curtis Spencer. Her husband, Orson Spencer, was a sensitive, well-educated man. She had been reared in Boston and was cultured and refined. She and Orson had six children. After leaving Nauvoo, her delicate health declined from exposure and hardship. Elder Spencer wrote to her parents and asked if she could return to live with them while he established a home for her in the West. Their reply: "Let her renounce her degrading faith, and she can come back, but never until she does." Sister Spencer would not renounce her faith. When her parents letter was read to her, she asked her husband to get his Bible and read to her from the book of Ruth: "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16). Outside the storm raged, the wagon covers leaked, and friends held milk pans over Sister Spencers head to keep her dry. In these conditions, and without a word of complaint, she closed her eyes for the last time.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Though we may not necessarily forfeit our lives in service to our God, we can certainly demonstrate our love for Him by how well we serve Him. He who hears our silent prayers, He who observes our unheralded acts will reward us openly when the need comes.</p>
<p>Should doubt knock at your doorway, just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts: "I propose to stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness and contentment are there, and I forbid you, agnostic, doubting thoughts, to destroy the house of my faith. I grant that I cannot explain the miracles of the Bible, and I do not attempt to do so, but I accept Gods word. I wasnt with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through science, and I will not permit so-called science to destroy it. When I change my mind about God and His work, only the inspiration of God will change it."</p>
<p><i>Frame your life with faith.</i></p>
<p><i></i>When you choose your friends with caution, plan your future with purpose, and frame your life with faith, you will merit the companionship of the Holy Spirit. You will have a perfect brightness of hope. You will testify through your own experience to the truth of the Lords promise:</p>
<p><i>I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i></p>
<p><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i> [D&amp;C 76:56]</p>
<p>To these perfect truths I bear my solemn witness and invoke the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful and humbled to be with you today.
As I was preparing for my talk, I was reminded of a story I once heard in a stake conference session a number of years ago. The story begins with a rancher performing chores out on his ranch one morning when he sees a shiny pickup truck drive onto his ranch and park.
Out of the truck steps a man in uniform who walks up to the rancher and states, "Im here to inspect your ranch for any illegally grown drugs."
The rancher responds, "Fine, but do not go in that field over there," and points to a beautiful field to the east.
The officer replies, "Mister, I dont think you understand me. I am here to inspect your ranch, and I have the authority of the federal government behind me." Reaching into his pocket he pulls out some form of a badge and proudly displays the badge to the rancher. "See this badge, old man? This badge means I am allowed to go on any land," he says, pointing all across the farmers ranch. "Have I made myself clear?"
The rancher apologizes, nods, and goes about his chores.
A short while later the old rancher hears someone screaming, looks up, and sees the officer running while being chased by a large bull in the field that the rancher had told the officer not to enter. With every step the officer takes, the bull takes two. With the distance shrinking between the charging bull and the frantic officer, the rancher steps up onto the fence enclosing the field and yells, "Your badge - show him your badge!"
On college campuses everywhere, including this one, we do a fair amount of badge showing - and for good reason. Our faculty have gone to top graduate schools and have trained with many of the best scholars, which, among other benefits, has helped prepare them to stand at the front of their classrooms and speak with expertise and authority. Unfortunately I have no badge to pull from my pocket demonstrating my credentials to speak today. I am grateful for the vote of confidence from President Worthen and Vice President Richardson in extending this invitation. I am also grateful to each of you for coming to todays devotional. It is not lost on me that you have the choice to attend or not. To this end, I hope and pray for the presence of the Spirit and that we may be edified as a result.
I am grateful for my wife, Marcie, and for my children, all of whom are here except for our oldest daughter, Sarah, who is serving a mission in South Carolina and happens to return from her mission next week; we are excited at our house. I am grateful for my mother, other family members, and dear friends and colleagues who are here today as well.
Rafting Gone Awry
I had the good fortune of growing up in the state of Alaska. It was a fantastic place to be raised. As an example of this, each year our Boy Scout troop would plan and carry out amazing high-adventure camps. We would go backpacking, </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">We live in some challenging times. More than fifty years ago President Thomas S. Monson said:
Today, we are encamped against the greatest array of sin, vice, and evil ever assembled before our eyes.1
I thought to myself that whatever the conditions were fifty years ago, there is a greater array today. The war between good and evil is raging and intensifying. Satan is busy radicalizing and recruiting. You are needed. You must gain the skills, convictions, courage, wisdom, and confidence to help make a difference for yourself and others. I am grateful for the inspired leadership of the Twelve and the First Presidency to help us be prepared.
Most of you are at a significant transition point in your lives. You are making life-changing decisions about your education, careers, marriage, and family as well as your religious practice after schooling and missions. You are making decisions as you transition from being dependent on goals set by others to being independent and self-reliant, setting your own goals and making your own way. Many of those decisions are not as clear or as easy to make as you would like them to be. Trying to find your way is a challenge.
Today I would like to share a few lessons I have learned that may help you find your way. I invite you to take notes of any "actionable takeaways." Later you can decide how to act on what you hear.
Set Your Destination, Prepare, and Act on Your Plan
After graduating from BYU, I took a job with the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington. I was soon called as an assistant Scoutmaster in our ward. One year we spent the summer taking hikes, including a fifty-miler around Mount Rainier. The early hikes prepared us physically and helped us develop the skills needed for the ultimate hike. We learned how to use maps and the compass and also to set checkpoints along the trail to find where we were and how to get where we wanted to go. It was a wonderful time for us.
For the Scouts, a hike in the Cascades was an exciting adventure and an end in itself, but for us, as leaders, it was an opportunity to teach them the skills, character traits, and testimony needed for lifes journey.
Our journeys of life are like these hikes. We each choose our destination and path. However, after the judgment at the end of this life, we will be assigned a place to live and things to do based on our decisions and actions here. Choose wisely the best path as described by the plan of salvation. Map your course by learning as much as you can, setting your checkpoints, and following your plan.
You Have a Royal Heritage
Throughout literature there are stories told of individuals who were destined for greatness or were of royal birth who were sent away from their homes. They did not know who they were, their heritage, or their destiny. You know about Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, and perhaps a few others.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">President and Sister Uchtdorf, Elder Cardon, President and Sister Samuelson, all of the other distinguished Brethren from Salt Lake, all of the faculty and staff, students, friends, and family: There are some of you who will remember the classic childrens story Winnie-the-Pooh. As you recall, Pooh had a very unique way of going down stairs. He would go bump, bump, bump, bump down the stairs on the back of his head.
According to one telling of the story, one day Christopher Robin asked Pooh why he always went down stairs on the back of his head when it must really hurt.
Poohs response was classic. He said that he didnt know why and that he had been going down stairs that way for so long that he didnt know there was any other way to do it. (See The Positive Project, "Bump, bump, bump . . . ," thinkpositivetoday.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/bump-bump-bump; see also chapter 1, A. A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh [1926].)
Once Pooh realizes that he can make the decision to do it another way, he will find that he can go down stairs like everyone else. How many of us are like Pooh Bear? We get so stuck in a rut with the things we do and the decisions we make that we dont realize that there are other alternatives from which we can choose. This is how some of our habits form.
Most decisions we make are simple day-to-day decisions (e.g., what time we are going to get up, where we are going to go today, what entree we are going to order from the menu). Other decisions get a little bit more complicated (e.g., what courses I will take, what job I will take, where I will live). And other decisions really require a lot of thought (e.g., whom I shall marry, what I need to do to retain the Spirit in my life, how I will demonstrate my love for the Savior). We are making these decisions every day of our lives, and we will yet make thousands more.
You have made one of the key decisions of your life: to work hard enough to graduate from one of the worlds great institutions. Do you realize what that will mean to you? It doesnt mean that you simply survived. You have actually succeeded in accomplishing that for which you will be forever grateful. It doesnt matter whether you go on to work in the Church, at home, in your community, or in the workplace. You have made decisions and have taken the responsibility to succeed at something only a handful of people have ever done. In very deed you have prepared yourself for a life of service and continued learning by finding added meaning in your life through those experiences you have had here at BYU. The significance of that will unfold as the years pass.
Whatever your decisions, what I hope for you and what I pray for is that you will make the Lord a key part of those decisions, whether they are great or small. I also hope you will remember a little saying that has guided me for years. It goes something like this:
You are what you do;

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My wife, Christy, and I are so thrilled to be with you. When we were young and skinny BYU undergraduates, if someone had suggested we would return in thirty years to speak to students in the Marriott Center due to my calling in the Seventy, we would have laughed uncontrollably. Yet I suppose our visit today illustrates the marvelous wonder of the gospel of Jesus Christ. When we seek to be led by the Spirit and go forth in faith, often not knowing precisely what course to pursue, life can curiously turn out to be more abundant than we might ever have imagined.
You young adults are now living in what Elder Robert D. Hales of the Twelve Apostles has called "the decade of decision." Many of the most important choices of your life will be made in your late teens and twenties, such as "going to the temple, serving a mission, getting an education, selecting an occupation, and choosing a companion and being sealed for time and for all eternity in the holy temple."1
Today I speak particularly to those persons who are struggling with one of these important decisions - some perhaps almost paralyzed from fear of making the wrong decision and some maybe needing only a little reinforcement to remain confident in a decision made previously.
Four lessons of inspired decision making by Nephi in the well-known opening chapters of the Book of Mormon, if applied, can reduce your fears and increase your confidence to go forward.
Lesson 1: Qualify for the Spirit by Obeying Commandments
The last sentence of Nephis sacred record encapsulates his life: "For thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey."2 Nephis faith in and love for the Savior is exemplified in his actions to obey Gods commandments. He prayed, crying unto the Lord in his youth until he obtained a testimony.3 He served as a missionary, teaching and inviting Ishmaels family even without an "Elder Nephi" name tag.4 He read the scriptures, searching the brass plates until he understood them and could teach from them.5 He sought after and followed the direction of a living prophet, which blessed him spiritually and temporally.6 Such obedience permitted the Holy Ghost to powerfully accompany Nephi throughout his life and yielded ongoing personal revelation.
As young adults who have been taught gospel truths and have accepted sacred covenants, you too must stay close to the Lord by keeping Gods commandments. I testify that consistent obedience to small things such as reading the scriptures and praying daily, attending Church meetings, heeding the counsel of living prophets, and serving others will qualify you for the Spirit - and the revelation He brings.
Now, as obedient as N</span>
