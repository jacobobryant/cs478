  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Our being here reminds us of those days when we were where you are now in your schooling. We had three important goals. One was to &lt;i&gt;get married. &lt;/i&gt;Then, once married, our next goal was to &lt;i&gt;get by &lt;/i&gt;financially. Then our goal was to &lt;i&gt;get through. &lt;/i&gt;We got married when Sister Nelson was an undergraduate student and I was in my second year of medical school.

Because I was under legal age, parental consent was required. My father was very amused when I called him away from his work to sign for me so I could get a marriage certificate. With Sister Nelson’s (and parental) help, we were able to make it through medical school after we each received our baccalaureate degree. I then informed her that it was customary to have a year internship. Following that I was determined to specialize, and I let her know that it would require additional training.

I’ll confess to a bit of naivete. If we had known that the interval between my getting my doctor’s degree and our finally going into practice would be twelve and a half years with six children added, we might not have been quite as enthusiastic in the beginning. So I pay great tribute to her for her role in our partnership. I owe so much to her.

Now I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to direct our discussion tonight.

I have entitled my remarks “Begin with the End in Mind.” I suppose some of this comes from my surgical background. An elective incision is never made without planning to close it. The same principle is generally applicable in all fields, however. Track stars don’t begin a race without knowing the location of the finish line.

So, in your important race, I would plead for you to begin with the end in mind. To assist you in defining that end, I would ask you this simple question: What would you like said about you at your funeral? Or, if you were to write your own eulogy and you could have only three sentences (no big flowery speeches, please), what would you want to say?

If it’s fair for me to ask that of you, it’s fair for you to ask that of me. If I were to write what I hope might be said about me, those three sentences would include:

I was able to render service of worth to my fellowmen.

I had a fine family.

I evidenced unshakable faith in God and lived accordingly.

Some of you have already defined your goals. Some have even developed a system of priorities to give order to your interests and responsibilities. I applaud such discipline and think it’s useful, but I believe that this ordering process may often be a little artificial. Rarely do we fragment the life that we live. It is not possible to influence one facet of our life without that affecting other aspects as well. So, in my own experience, I have preferred not to compartmentalize my interests, but to synergize them. Let me explain what I mean.

Nephi said, “I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” (1 Nephi 19:23). He was advising us to weave the fiber of scriptural wisdom into the fabric of our own being.

King Benjamin taught this interrelationship:

&lt;i&gt;When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. &lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 2:17]

As I ponder serving God, I recognize that I cannot serve him without first serving the children that he has sent to bless our family. Then, as I ponder service to our children, I know I cannot serve them to the fullest without first serving and honoring my wife, the mother of those children.

She is my highest priority. When we were married, we vowed that we would “seek &lt;i&gt;first &lt;/i&gt;the kingdom of God and his righteousness” (see Matthew 6:33). Do you see how &lt;i&gt;these goals and priorities all are indelibly intertwined? &lt;/i&gt;To say that your highest priority will be to your occupation or to your family or to the Lord is really much more difficult than it is to merge strengths and pursue those interests concurrently.

One of the most remarkable things about these three objectives is that they all have one requirement in common. That requirement is education. The educational process is crucial for success in each objective and is neverending.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Service to Mankind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
First, with regard to service of worth to mankind, I was introduced to you as a heart surgeon. But that really doesn’t tell the whole story. When I started medical school, we were taught that one must not touch the heart, for if one did, it would stop beating. But I also pondered the scripture that tells us that “all kingdoms have a law given. . . . And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions” (D&amp;amp;C 88:36, 38). I believed sincerely the scripture that certifies:

&lt;i&gt;When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 130:21]

Knowing these scriptures while concentrating on the “kingdom” of and the blessing of the beating heart, I knew that even the function of this vital organ was predicated upon law.

I reasoned that if those laws could be understood and controlled, perhaps they could be utilized for the blessing of the sick. To me this meant that if we would work, study, and ask the proper questions in our scientific experiments, we could learn the laws that govern the heartbeat.

In 1949 our group of researchers presented at the American College of Surgeons the report of the first successful use of the artificial heart-lung machine in sustaining the life of an animal for a thirty-minute period of time, without its own heart powering its circulation.

In the decade of the 1950s&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;successes in the animal laboratory were extended to human beings. Now, with many of those laws learned, the heartbeat can be turned off while performing delicate repairs on the damaged valves or vessels, and then turned on again—provided the laws are obeyed upon which that blessing is predicated. Over 200,000 open-heart operations are performed in this country annually, and many more worldwide, thereby extending life for many. But you should know that it was through the understanding of the scriptures and “likening” them to this area of interest, that the great field of heart surgery as we know it today was facilitated for me.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Turning now from service of worth to my fellowmen, the second sentence that I hope may be said of me at my funeral would be that I had a fine family. That’s really a subject near and dear to my heart, and I won’t try to treat it broadly except to say that Sister Nelson has brought into our family ten beautiful children. We have tried to treat them consonantly with important scriptures: “Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee” (Exodus 20:12). The importance of honoring parents extends beyond your own father and mother. This scripture implies that we honor the father and the mother of children that might yet be born to us. We considered this implication while dating and in the early years of our marriage. But I fully understood that concept only later as I watched Sister Nelson cradle those children in her arms as they arrived one by one. Each time she reassured herself and her newborn baby that no blessing was ever withheld from that child because of any act of impurity in her life that could have deprived that infant of its full potential in any way. To honor father and mother means to honor fatherhood and motherhood and the divine provision for procreation and all that pertains to it.

Part of honoring parenthood is honoring children. There is a great temptation to believe erroneously that our children are our possessions. They are not. They are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. Their spirits are eternal as are ours. This was brought forcibly to my attention many years ago when our youngest was about four years of age. I came home from work one night to find my sweetheart very weary from a full day with nine children underfoot. My day had been heavy also, but I offered to get the children ready for bed. I began to give the orders to our little four-year-old daughter: take your clothes off, hang them up, brush your teeth, get your pajamas on, say your prayers, etc.—commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeant in the army. She then cocked her little head to one side, looked at me with her wistful eyes, and said, “Daddy, do you own me?”

Then I realized that I was using coercive methods on this sweet spirit and that to rule children by command or force is the technique of Satan, not of the Savior. She taught me this important lesson: We don’t own our children; we have them for a brief season. As parents, it is our privilege to love them, to lead them, and then to let them go.

The Lord said, “I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth” (D&amp;amp;C 93:40). This we have tried to do.

Another aspect of our parental responsibility has been to be faithful to the duty we were called to perform in the Church. Is this a paradox in priorities? No, it isn’t. A scripture states: “Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this &lt;i&gt;because of &lt;/i&gt;thy family” (D&amp;amp;C 23:3; emphasis added). We have recognized that among the fine things we can do for our children is to be faithful to any call we have received in the Church. Experience gained in the Church strengthens our capacity to serve the public and our family.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faith in God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third sentence that I hope I may merit at my funeral service is that my faith in God was unshakable. I do have a deep and abiding faith in him and his son, Jesus Christ. Educa-tion has increased that faith. As I have spent forty years of my life in the study of one of God’s greatest creations, the human body, I know that this marvelous instrument is of divine origin. The anatomy, the physiology, the protective mechanisms, the healing powers—all are so well constructed and function so beautifully. It is as evident to me that they are the products of a divine creator as it must be for an astronomer to reach the same conclusion as he studies the endless phenomenon of the stars in the heavens.

Furthering education need not challenge, but should increase your faith. In fact, we have a religious responsibility to educate our minds. “The glory of God is intelligence” (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). We have a divine command to “obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man” (D&amp;amp;C 93:53). Similarly, the Lord exhorted us to “study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people” (D&amp;amp;C 90:15).

The scriptures further admonish, “Learn wisdom in thy youth” (Alma 37:35, see also Proverbs 29:3). “Teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you” (D&amp;amp;C 88:77–78).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steps in Learning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We all understand the &lt;i&gt;importance &lt;/i&gt;of education. Perhaps now we should consider &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;to learn. May I suggest four steps to facilitate the learning process.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Desire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The first is to have a great &lt;i&gt;desire &lt;/i&gt;to know the truth. As a teacher of surgery for many years, I have observed the differences in desires of individuals to learn. Before every operation there is an interval for scrubbing hands for a measured period of time. Some trainees have either been silent or have passed this time with trivial conversations that had no substance. Those with desire filled that time with questions. I observed that students with great desire know what they don’t know and seek to fill those voids.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inquire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The second step would be to study with an &lt;i&gt;inquiring &lt;/i&gt;mind. Again I take this pattern from the scriptures. You remember that when the brother of Jared was preparing for a transoceanic migration, he realized there was no provision for light in the ships. So he asked the Lord, “Shall we cross this great water in darkness?”

The Lord gave an interesting reply: “What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? . . . Ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you. . . . Ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea” (Ether 2:22–24).

The Lord could have told the brother of Jared what to do, but he was left to study this out in his own mind before proffering the solution. As a result, he selected sixteen stones and then asked the Lord to touch them that they might provide the light for their travel.

That same concept was again stressed in latter-day revelation, when the Lord told his servant, “You have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right” (D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8).

Many of the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants were given to the prophets only after profound study and thoughtful, focused inquiry of the Lord. So it was with the Word of Wisdom and the revelation on the priesthood given to President Spencer W. Kimball in 1978. Similarly, you will learn best with the spirit of inquiry.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apply&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The third step is to &lt;i&gt;apply &lt;/i&gt;or practice your learning in your daily lives. Those who have learned another language know how important that is. Even with great desire and study, mastery of a language comes only as it is applied to the daily situations of life.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The fourth and very important step in the learning process is to &lt;i&gt;pray &lt;/i&gt;for help. I did not hesitate to communicate with the Lord in great detail, even about the technical steps in a new operative procedure that was to be performed. Often just the process of rehearsing it in my mind while engaged in prayer allowed divine direction for me to see a better way.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Warning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now may I offer important words of warning: Learning, if misused, can destroy your goals. Let us consider some safeguards to protect you from such an undesirable end.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nourishment&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Your faith must be nourished. You are blessed at this university to do this by enrolling in religion classes. Enrich that faith additionally with private scriptural study and with exposure to other fine books, art, or music. Nourish the gifts of the Spirit on the same daily basis that you feed your physical body.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Role Model&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Choose your role model wisely. Before you endorse all of the teachings of any teacher, ask yourself if his or her &lt;i&gt;faith &lt;/i&gt;is strong enough to be worthy of emulation. If it isn’t, be very discriminating in what you learn from such an individual. Remember that the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price are the standards by which you should measure all doctrine.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avoid Pitfalls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Avoid poisons of faith such as sin, pornography, or barely abiding the letter of the law instead of embracing the ennobling spirit of the law. Remember, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life” (2 Corinthians 3:6).
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prepare for Challenges&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Many challenges will be put in your way. You will hear allegations that the Church is “anti-intellectual.” When people make that statement, I am reminded of a common sight in the jungles of Africa. A bird, like the critic, will often perch on the uppermost part of an elephant. This bird pecks away at the hide of the stately animal, achieving temporary nourishment and position of eminence by virtue of this association. While the elephant doesn’t need the bird, the bird needs the elephant for its place of prominence. Though the bird may peck, squawk, and smear, the elephant steadily pursues its course in seeming oblivion to its parasitic passenger.

To the charge that the Church is “anti-intellectual,”&lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;are the greatest evidence to refute such an erroneous statement. Individually, you have been encouraged to learn and to seek knowledge from any dependable source. In the Church, we embrace &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;truth, whether it comes from the scientific laboratory or from the revealed word of the Lord. We accept all &lt;i&gt;truth &lt;/i&gt;as being part of the gospel. One truth does not contradict another.

Some of the greatest “intellectuals” have been those with the strongest faith. Socrates felt that the unexamined life is not worth living, so nothing was exempt from his questioning. But he, with Immanual Kant, had unwavering faith in God, freedom, and immortality. Socrates never doubted the will of his personal God. He believed so much in freedom that he tied his own self-responsibility to that freedom. So deeply did he believe in the doctrine of immortality of the soul that although he might have prolonged his biological life by choosing exile, he submitted with complete serenity to the death sentence of the Athenian court.

Louis Pasteur made this statement on his reception into the French Academy:

&lt;i&gt;The Greeks have given us one of the most beautiful words in our language, the word enthusiasm, which means “a God within.&lt;/i&gt;” &lt;i&gt;The grandeur of the acts of men is measured by the inspiration from which they spring. Happy is he who bears a God within!&lt;/i&gt; [See Rene J. Dubos, &lt;i&gt;Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science &lt;/i&gt;(Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1950), p. 392]

Consider the Council of the Twelve. Eleven of them hold baccalaureate degrees. (The one exception was occasioned by the interruption of collegiate education by war.) In addition, there are &lt;i&gt;seven &lt;/i&gt;earned doctor’s degrees among those twelve men. I must add that educational attainments have not qualified them for their spiritual callings, but they do indicate that their own scholarly pursuits make them not only sympathetic to, but supportive of the divine decrees to gain knowledge.

Fortify yourselves against attacks on the leaders of the Church. They have never purported to be perfect or even close to it. In fact, the Lord described them as “the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised.” But, the Lord continued, they will “thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit” (D&amp;amp;C 35:13).

Under brutal attack by his critics, Joseph Smith said, “I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught. Must I, then, be thrown away as a thing of naught?” (&lt;i&gt;Teachings, &lt;/i&gt;p. 368).

As you edify yourselves with education for the eternities, search the scriptures. Liken them unto you. Learn the law in the kingdom of your own activity. Use the standard works as literal standards of eternal excellence against which you measure every thought and deed.

Begin with the end in mind. Shape your own destiny. Remember that the development of your career, your family, and your faith in God is your individual responsibility—for which you alone will be held accountable.

To you, I extend my love and invoke an apostolic blessing upon you that success will be yours in all your righteous’ endeavors. I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the son of the Living God, the head of this Church, and our advocate with the Father. I testify to the divine role of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the restoration of the gospel, and that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Our being here reminds us of those days when we were where you are now in your schooling. We had three important goals. One was to <i>get married. </i>Then, once married, our next goal was to <i>get by </i>financially. Then our goal was to <i>get through. </i>We got married when Sister Nelson was an undergraduate student and I was in my second year of medical school.</p>
<p>Because I was under legal age, parental consent was required. My father was very amused when I called him away from his work to sign for me so I could get a marriage certificate. With Sister Nelson’s (and parental) help, we were able to make it through medical school after we each received our baccalaureate degree. I then informed her that it was customary to have a year internship. Following that I was determined to specialize, and I let her know that it would require additional training.</p>
<p>I’ll confess to a bit of naivete. If we had known that the interval between my getting my doctor’s degree and our finally going into practice would be twelve and a half years with six children added, we might not have been quite as enthusiastic in the beginning. So I pay great tribute to her for her role in our partnership. I owe so much to her.</p>
<p>Now I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to direct our discussion tonight.</p>
<p>I have entitled my remarks “Begin with the End in Mind.” I suppose some of this comes from my surgical background. An elective incision is never made without planning to close it. The same principle is generally applicable in all fields, however. Track stars don’t begin a race without knowing the location of the finish line.</p>
<p>So, in your important race, I would plead for you to begin with the end in mind. To assist you in defining that end, I would ask you this simple question: What would you like said about you at your funeral? Or, if you were to write your own eulogy and you could have only three sentences (no big flowery speeches, please), what would you want to say?</p>
<p>If it’s fair for me to ask that of you, it’s fair for you to ask that of me. If I were to write what I hope might be said about me, those three sentences would include:</p>
<p>I was able to render service of worth to my fellowmen.</p>
<p>I had a fine family.</p>
<p>I evidenced unshakable faith in God and lived accordingly.</p>
<p>Some of you have already defined your goals. Some have even developed a system of priorities to give order to your interests and responsibilities. I applaud such discipline and think it’s useful, but I believe that this ordering process may often be a little artificial. Rarely do we fragment the life that we live. It is not possible to influence one facet of our life without that affecting other aspects as well. So, in my own experience, I have preferred not to compartmentalize my interests, but to synergize them. Let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p>Nephi said, “I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” (1 Nephi 19:23). He was advising us to weave the fiber of scriptural wisdom into the fabric of our own being.</p>
<p>King Benjamin taught this interrelationship:</p>
<p><i>When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. </i>[Mosiah 2:17]</p>
<p>As I ponder serving God, I recognize that I cannot serve him without first serving the children that he has sent to bless our family. Then, as I ponder service to our children, I know I cannot serve them to the fullest without first serving and honoring my wife, the mother of those children.</p>
<p>She is my highest priority. When we were married, we vowed that we would “seek <i>first </i>the kingdom of God and his righteousness” (see Matthew 6:33). Do you see how <i>these goals and priorities all are indelibly intertwined? </i>To say that your highest priority will be to your occupation or to your family or to the Lord is really much more difficult than it is to merge strengths and pursue those interests concurrently.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable things about these three objectives is that they all have one requirement in common. That requirement is education. The educational process is crucial for success in each objective and is neverending.</p>
<h2><b>Service to Mankind</b></h2>
<p>First, with regard to service of worth to mankind, I was introduced to you as a heart surgeon. But that really doesn’t tell the whole story. When I started medical school, we were taught that one must not touch the heart, for if one did, it would stop beating. But I also pondered the scripture that tells us that “all kingdoms have a law given. . . . And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions” (D&amp;C 88:36, 38). I believed sincerely the scripture that certifies:</p>
<p><i>When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated. </i>[D&amp;C 130:21]</p>
<p>Knowing these scriptures while concentrating on the “kingdom” of and the blessing of the beating heart, I knew that even the function of this vital organ was predicated upon law.</p>
<p>I reasoned that if those laws could be understood and controlled, perhaps they could be utilized for the blessing of the sick. To me this meant that if we would work, study, and ask the proper questions in our scientific experiments, we could learn the laws that govern the heartbeat.</p>
<p>In 1949 our group of researchers presented at the American College of Surgeons the report of the first successful use of the artificial heart-lung machine in sustaining the life of an animal for a thirty-minute period of time, without its own heart powering its circulation.</p>
<p>In the decade of the 1950s<i>, </i>successes in the animal laboratory were extended to human beings. Now, with many of those laws learned, the heartbeat can be turned off while performing delicate repairs on the damaged valves or vessels, and then turned on again—provided the laws are obeyed upon which that blessing is predicated. Over 200,000 open-heart operations are performed in this country annually, and many more worldwide, thereby extending life for many. But you should know that it was through the understanding of the scriptures and “likening” them to this area of interest, that the great field of heart surgery as we know it today was facilitated for me.</p>
<h2><b>Family</b></h2>
<p>Turning now from service of worth to my fellowmen, the second sentence that I hope may be said of me at my funeral would be that I had a fine family. That’s really a subject near and dear to my heart, and I won’t try to treat it broadly except to say that Sister Nelson has brought into our family ten beautiful children. We have tried to treat them consonantly with important scriptures: “Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee” (Exodus 20:12). The importance of honoring parents extends beyond your own father and mother. This scripture implies that we honor the father and the mother of children that might yet be born to us. We considered this implication while dating and in the early years of our marriage. But I fully understood that concept only later as I watched Sister Nelson cradle those children in her arms as they arrived one by one. Each time she reassured herself and her newborn baby that no blessing was ever withheld from that child because of any act of impurity in her life that could have deprived that infant of its full potential in any way. To honor father and mother means to honor fatherhood and motherhood and the divine provision for procreation and all that pertains to it.</p>
<p>Part of honoring parenthood is honoring children. There is a great temptation to believe erroneously that our children are our possessions. They are not. They are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. Their spirits are eternal as are ours. This was brought forcibly to my attention many years ago when our youngest was about four years of age. I came home from work one night to find my sweetheart very weary from a full day with nine children underfoot. My day had been heavy also, but I offered to get the children ready for bed. I began to give the orders to our little four-year-old daughter: take your clothes off, hang them up, brush your teeth, get your pajamas on, say your prayers, etc.—commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeant in the army. She then cocked her little head to one side, looked at me with her wistful eyes, and said, “Daddy, do you own me?”</p>
<p>Then I realized that I was using coercive methods on this sweet spirit and that to rule children by command or force is the technique of Satan, not of the Savior. She taught me this important lesson: We don’t own our children; we have them for a brief season. As parents, it is our privilege to love them, to lead them, and then to let them go.</p>
<p>The Lord said, “I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth” (D&amp;C 93:40). This we have tried to do.</p>
<p>Another aspect of our parental responsibility has been to be faithful to the duty we were called to perform in the Church. Is this a paradox in priorities? No, it isn’t. A scripture states: “Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this <i>because of </i>thy family” (D&amp;C 23:3; emphasis added). We have recognized that among the fine things we can do for our children is to be faithful to any call we have received in the Church. Experience gained in the Church strengthens our capacity to serve the public and our family.</p>
<h2><b>Faith in God</b></h2>
<p>The third sentence that I hope I may merit at my funeral service is that my faith in God was unshakable. I do have a deep and abiding faith in him and his son, Jesus Christ. Educa-tion has increased that faith. As I have spent forty years of my life in the study of one of God’s greatest creations, the human body, I know that this marvelous instrument is of divine origin. The anatomy, the physiology, the protective mechanisms, the healing powers—all are so well constructed and function so beautifully. It is as evident to me that they are the products of a divine creator as it must be for an astronomer to reach the same conclusion as he studies the endless phenomenon of the stars in the heavens.</p>
<p>Furthering education need not challenge, but should increase your faith. In fact, we have a religious responsibility to educate our minds. “The glory of God is intelligence” (D&amp;C 93:36). We have a divine command to “obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man” (D&amp;C 93:53). Similarly, the Lord exhorted us to “study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people” (D&amp;C 90:15).</p>
<p>The scriptures further admonish, “Learn wisdom in thy youth” (Alma 37:35, see also Proverbs 29:3). “Teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you” (D&amp;C 88:77–78).</p>
<h2><b>Steps in Learning</b></h2>
<p>We all understand the <i>importance </i>of education. Perhaps now we should consider <i>how </i>to learn. May I suggest four steps to facilitate the learning process.</p>
<h3><b><i>Desire</i></b></h3>
<p>The first is to have a great <i>desire </i>to know the truth. As a teacher of surgery for many years, I have observed the differences in desires of individuals to learn. Before every operation there is an interval for scrubbing hands for a measured period of time. Some trainees have either been silent or have passed this time with trivial conversations that had no substance. Those with desire filled that time with questions. I observed that students with great desire know what they don’t know and seek to fill those voids.</p>
<h3><b><i>Inquire</i></b></h3>
<p>The second step would be to study with an <i>inquiring </i>mind. Again I take this pattern from the scriptures. You remember that when the brother of Jared was preparing for a transoceanic migration, he realized there was no provision for light in the ships. So he asked the Lord, “Shall we cross this great water in darkness?”</p>
<p>The Lord gave an interesting reply: “What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? . . . Ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you. . . . Ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea” (Ether 2:22–24).</p>
<p>The Lord could have told the brother of Jared what to do, but he was left to study this out in his own mind before proffering the solution. As a result, he selected sixteen stones and then asked the Lord to touch them that they might provide the light for their travel.</p>
<p>That same concept was again stressed in latter-day revelation, when the Lord told his servant, “You have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right” (D&amp;C 9:7–8).</p>
<p>Many of the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants were given to the prophets only after profound study and thoughtful, focused inquiry of the Lord. So it was with the Word of Wisdom and the revelation on the priesthood given to President Spencer W. Kimball in 1978. Similarly, you will learn best with the spirit of inquiry.</p>
<h3><b><i>Apply</i></b></h3>
<p>The third step is to <i>apply </i>or practice your learning in your daily lives. Those who have learned another language know how important that is. Even with great desire and study, mastery of a language comes only as it is applied to the daily situations of life.</p>
<h3><b><i>Pray</i></b></h3>
<p>The fourth and very important step in the learning process is to <i>pray </i>for help. I did not hesitate to communicate with the Lord in great detail, even about the technical steps in a new operative procedure that was to be performed. Often just the process of rehearsing it in my mind while engaged in prayer allowed divine direction for me to see a better way.</p>
<h2><b>A Warning</b></h2>
<p>Now may I offer important words of warning: Learning, if misused, can destroy your goals. Let us consider some safeguards to protect you from such an undesirable end.</p>
<h3><b><i>Nourishment</i></b></h3>
<p>Your faith must be nourished. You are blessed at this university to do this by enrolling in religion classes. Enrich that faith additionally with private scriptural study and with exposure to other fine books, art, or music. Nourish the gifts of the Spirit on the same daily basis that you feed your physical body.</p>
<h3><b><i>Role Model</i></b></h3>
<p>Choose your role model wisely. Before you endorse all of the teachings of any teacher, ask yourself if his or her <i>faith </i>is strong enough to be worthy of emulation. If it isn’t, be very discriminating in what you learn from such an individual. Remember that the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price are the standards by which you should measure all doctrine.</p>
<h3><b><i>Avoid Pitfalls</i></b></h3>
<p>Avoid poisons of faith such as sin, pornography, or barely abiding the letter of the law instead of embracing the ennobling spirit of the law. Remember, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life” (2 Corinthians 3:6).</p>
<h3><b><i>Prepare for Challenges</i></b></h3>
<p>Many challenges will be put in your way. You will hear allegations that the Church is “anti-intellectual.” When people make that statement, I am reminded of a common sight in the jungles of Africa. A bird, like the critic, will often perch on the uppermost part of an elephant. This bird pecks away at the hide of the stately animal, achieving temporary nourishment and position of eminence by virtue of this association. While the elephant doesn’t need the bird, the bird needs the elephant for its place of prominence. Though the bird may peck, squawk, and smear, the elephant steadily pursues its course in seeming oblivion to its parasitic passenger.</p>
<p>To the charge that the Church is “anti-intellectual,”<i>you </i>are the greatest evidence to refute such an erroneous statement. Individually, you have been encouraged to learn and to seek knowledge from any dependable source. In the Church, we embrace <i>all </i>truth, whether it comes from the scientific laboratory or from the revealed word of the Lord. We accept all <i>truth </i>as being part of the gospel. One truth does not contradict another.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest “intellectuals” have been those with the strongest faith. Socrates felt that the unexamined life is not worth living, so nothing was exempt from his questioning. But he, with Immanual Kant, had unwavering faith in God, freedom, and immortality. Socrates never doubted the will of his personal God. He believed so much in freedom that he tied his own self-responsibility to that freedom. So deeply did he believe in the doctrine of immortality of the soul that although he might have prolonged his biological life by choosing exile, he submitted with complete serenity to the death sentence of the Athenian court.</p>
<p>Louis Pasteur made this statement on his reception into the French Academy:</p>
<p><i>The Greeks have given us one of the most beautiful words in our language, the word enthusiasm, which means “a God within.</i>” <i>The grandeur of the acts of men is measured by the inspiration from which they spring. Happy is he who bears a God within!</i> [See Rene J. Dubos, <i>Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science </i>(Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1950), p. 392]</p>
<p>Consider the Council of the Twelve. Eleven of them hold baccalaureate degrees. (The one exception was occasioned by the interruption of collegiate education by war.) In addition, there are <i>seven </i>earned doctor’s degrees among those twelve men. I must add that educational attainments have not qualified them for their spiritual callings, but they do indicate that their own scholarly pursuits make them not only sympathetic to, but supportive of the divine decrees to gain knowledge.</p>
<p>Fortify yourselves against attacks on the leaders of the Church. They have never purported to be perfect or even close to it. In fact, the Lord described them as “the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised.” But, the Lord continued, they will “thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit” (D&amp;C 35:13).</p>
<p>Under brutal attack by his critics, Joseph Smith said, “I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught. Must I, then, be thrown away as a thing of naught?” (<i>Teachings, </i>p. 368).</p>
<p>As you edify yourselves with education for the eternities, search the scriptures. Liken them unto you. Learn the law in the kingdom of your own activity. Use the standard works as literal standards of eternal excellence against which you measure every thought and deed.</p>
<p>Begin with the end in mind. Shape your own destiny. Remember that the development of your career, your family, and your faith in God is your individual responsibility—for which you alone will be held accountable.</p>
<p>To you, I extend my love and invoke an apostolic blessing upon you that success will be yours in all your righteous’ endeavors. I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the son of the Living God, the head of this Church, and our advocate with the Father. I testify to the divine role of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the restoration of the gospel, and that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to explain the sequence of how I was first contacted to speak at this devotional. It was on a Monday that I got a text message from a number I didn’t recognize. It had been a hectic day, and I didn’t read the text fully. Thinking it was a request to speak at an upcoming Church assignment, I texted back politely asking who the text was from.
Matthew O. Richardson, BYU advancement vice president, responded that it was he who had sent the text asking me to speak at a BYU devotional.
The first thought that popped into my mind was, “Are you crazy? Do you not realize that I can barely speak the English language, let alone speak in front of so many people?”
My wife, who was with me at the time, responded without hesitation, “That is desperation, not inspiration!”
I texted President Richardson back with, “I think you have the wrong Craig Manning.”
He then replied, “Oops, sorry, I do have the wrong person!” But he then clarified that he did have the right person.
As intimidating as it is to speak in front of you, the experience of preparing for this devotional has been great. I have found that every time I have put on the radio, in every activity I have participated in, and with every thought I have had, I have double-checked myself to make sure I was in alignment with the Holy Ghost so as to have the Spirit with me. I do pray that the Spirit will be with me today as I deliver my thoughts.
I would like to talk to you today about a couple of life-changing lessons the Lord has taught me.
I was born and raised in Canberra, Australia. My mother was, and still is, a Catholic, and my father was a member of the Church of England before he passed away from cancer twenty years ago. We attended church on Sundays, and I attended Sunday School, completing my first Holy Communion. As I got older, I started playing rugby. Games were on Sundays, and it wasn’t long before we stopped attending church.
I remember coming home from a rugby game one Sunday when my mother said to me, “You are really good at sports, so you won’t be very good at school.”
This statement confused me. Although I didn’t have the maturity and clarity of thought at the time to articulate my emotions, I can look back now and see why this statement bothered me. Was there some phenomenon that controlled my destiny? I couldn’t help being good at sports; it just seemed to happen. Every time I participated in an athletic contest, I was reminded that I was a good athlete. So did that mean I had no chance of ever being a good student, and did I have any say in any of this?
I don’t share this story to accuse my mother of bad parenting but rather to illustrate what can happen when we don’t understand the Lord’s plan or, more important, when we don’t learn to live and apply the gospel of Jesus Christ. I spent my teenage years focusing the majority of my attention on sports, par</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many who speak at a Brigham Young University devotional make reference to their experiences as students at BYU and the insights they have gained by attending devotionals. I can’t do that because I never attended BYU. I am a Utah State University Aggie, and my Aggie blue runs deep. I am a big Cougar fan, but even after twenty years of holding season tickets for BYU basketball and football, I still can’t bring myself to sing, “Rise and shout.”
In those same twenty years I have also attended devotionals as a faculty member and have heard the testimonies of many of my colleagues and felt the spirit of many students as they have borne testimony through music. I am particularly humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today in a place where prophets and apostles have taught and testified.
Do We Really Believe in the Resurrection?
I am the youngest in a family of four boys, and about twenty-two years ago I was encouraged to apply for a faculty opening here at BYU in the Department of Mathematics. At the time, I was a faculty member at Oregon State University, and my three older brothers lived in Iowa, Washington, and California, while my parents lived in Logan, Utah. In addition to this being a great opportunity for me to come to BYU, it allowed me to be a little closer to my parents, because their health was failing.
My father did not want my decision to move to Utah to be based in any way on helping him and my mother. He was very proud of the fact that his sons were contributing to the kingdom outside of Utah. My wife, Shauna, and I felt that the move to BYU was the right decision, and we arrived here in August 1996.
Six months after our arrival in Provo, my father had surgery in Salt Lake City to repair a heart valve. Ten years earlier his original valve had been replaced with a pig valve, at which time he contracted hepatitis C. Because this pig valve was now failing, the doctors decided to replace it with a mechanical valve. During the surgery the doctors realized that the hepatitis C had wreaked havoc on my father’s liver, which made the heart surgery very traumatic on his body. This was the beginning of a seventeen-day roller coaster ride.
At this time my mother’s health was not good, so she was only able to visit my dad about every two to three days. Thus the responsibility of visiting my father and communicating with the doctors fell to my wife and me. One or the other of us would travel from Mapleton, about ten miles south of Provo, to the hospital in Salt Lake City every day. Many times my wife would visit in the afternoon, and I would spend the evening at the hospital, or vice versa. This was particularly challenging because we had four children ranging in age from three to nine.
I referred to this time as a roller coaster ride because on one day a particular doctor would be pessimistic and on the next day another doctor would be optimistic about the eventual outcome.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is wonderful to be here with you. I am a Cougar through and through—I love BYU. While here I obtained both my undergraduate and graduate degrees, created lasting friendships, and convinced Shelley Hatch to take a risk on me. She was the first of the two of us to graduate from BYU and is the best thing I gained from being here. I hope your time as a student will be as productive as mine was!
After I was called as a General Authority, Sister Nash and I—along with our two youngest children—were assigned to Lima, Peru, where I would serve in the Area Presidency. On our first Monday there, we were given a brief driving tour so that we could learn how to get to and from places such as home, the children’s school, the grocery store, and other places. Then they handed me the keys to the car.
This sounds simple, but the streets of Lima can be bewildering. Even seasoned inhabitants get lost. The traffic is in constant flow and the streets curve, twist, and turn—and never seem to intersect with another street that will take you back to the exit you just missed. It can seem at times that the streets of Lima are designed to take the unwary exactly where they do not intend to go! So after driving for approximately five minutes that first day, I missed a turn and got us completely lost—and that was for a few hours.
A year or two later Sister Nash, driving on her own in Lima, got lost and ended up in a part of the city that was uncomfortable and even dangerous—and she did not know how to get home. Then, in a moment of inspiration, it came to her that our recently obtained GPS had a button marked Home. She pushed that button and was guided safely home.
My dear students, the plan of salvation—one of the greatest treasures of knowledge restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith—is a perfect, fully updated spiritual GPS. It is a celestial map given to unerringly guide us home.
Please listen to what I am about to say, even though you have heard it before. Listen as if you were hearing this for the first time: each of us “is a beloved . . . son or daughter of heavenly parents,” and we lived with them prior to our mortal birth.1 Motivated by perfect love and a desire to give each of us as His children the opportunity to receive all He has, our Father in Heaven instituted a plan from before the foundation of this earth2 whereby we could obtain eternal life, “the greatest of all the gifts of God.”3 Put simply, eternal life is the life God lives!4 This plan of salvation was—and is—based upon laws and truths that have always existed5 and that make God what He is and heaven what it is.6 When the plan was explained to us in the premortal realm, you and I not only “shouted for joy”7 but also defended the plan against those who opposed it.8
The plan required that this beautiful world be created to give us </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you for that beautiful and calming musical number. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today and for the support of family, colleagues, students, and friends who are here.
I invite you to reflect on the last time you experienced the feeling of fear. Was it while wondering if you would be admitted into one of the many competitive degree programs here at Brigham Young University? Or while waiting to see if the girl you asked out wants to go out again? Or, worse yet, while wondering what to do when she does? For me, the feeling is as recent as sitting on this stand, looking into the faces of so many and knowing that, through the miracle of technology, thousands more are watching this message. Like you, I can testify that the feeling of fear is real. Elder David A. Bednar taught about this powerful emotion in last April’s general conference: “Notably, one of the first effects of the Fall was for Adam and Eve to experience fear. This potent emotion is an important element of our mortal existence.”1
Today I want to visit with you about overcoming the fears that are an essential part of our experience in this earth life.
Fear of an Unknown Future
One of my favorite classes to teach here on campus is the Doctrine and Covenants because I find it highly relevant in my own life and in the lives of my students. In a well-known episode from the text, Oliver Cowdery, the primary scribe for the translation of the Book of Mormon, was offered the opportunity of a lifetime: to join Joseph Smith as a translator of that sacred book of scripture. Oliver was instructed:
Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and that you may translate and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are sacred; and according to your faith shall it be done unto you.2
Shortly thereafter, when Oliver failed in his attempt to translate a portion of the Book of Mormon, the Lord explained the reasons for his failure. Outlining several causes, the Lord declared, “And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.”3 Furthermore, He added, “Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time is past, and it is not expedient now.”4
I have long wondered what it was that Oliver feared that caused him to not continue as he had commenced. Knowing that the project was of eternal importance, did he fear ­making a mistake and thus marring the sacred publication?
I was the age of most of you when this scriptural episode came to have special meaning for me. I was in graduate school here at BYU, and I began asking out a particular girl. And, as things progressed, I became scared. Like Ol</span>
