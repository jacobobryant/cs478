  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Happy Valentine’s Day! This is a day when we celebrate love. We think of love letters and hearts, roses and chocolate. Many hope today to &lt;i&gt;receive&lt;/i&gt; a message from one they love, and some are planning to &lt;i&gt;deliver&lt;/i&gt; a message to one they love. I hope you won’t be disappointed.

My parents loved me dearly—of that I had no doubt. But when I was ten years old, I had to attend boarding school in England while my parents continued to live thousands of miles away in Saudi Arabia. The separation was an enormous wrench for me.

On the long flight to England, I remember feeling queasy in the pit of my stomach as I left behind the heat and sunshine of Arabia, flew across the miles, and descended through multiple layers of cloud into the cold, gray scene of London’s Heathrow Airport. The rain droplets on the airplane window shot past, and I felt so very, very far from home.

I arrived at the school in my uniform of gray shorts, sweater, tie, and cap, pulling my great, green trunk of belongings behind me. The loneliness was overwhelming.

I slept in a dormitory with about fifteen other boys. It was a very foreign experience, complete with rickety, metal-framed beds and the occasional pillow fight. Every morning after making our beds, we boys would stand aside while our bed-making skills and “hospital corners” were graded. There were unfamiliar smells, unfamiliar foods, and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; unfamiliar teachers. My Latin master would walk around the room and peck our heads with the tip of his ballpoint pen if we didn’t know an answer. And I was very well pecked.

Out on the fields during our sports time, on a rare clear day, if a plane was flying high overhead, leaving a vapor trail, I would study its course to see if that plane might be heading back to Arabia—feeling a deep pang if it was. I longed, somehow, to jump aboard and go back home to my parents.

The brightest spot in any week came during breakfast time when mail was delivered. I would look anxiously for the telltale blue airmail letter that my mother sent faithfully every week. As the teachers came around the tables with letters to hand out, I would literally be on the edge of my bench waiting to see if one was for me. In so many senses this was Hogwarts, but without the owls and with none of the magic.

The blue airmail letters were often the highlight of my week, particularly in those early days when my loneliness was most acute. I would receive letters from home with such happiness and relief. I would wait until I could be alone to carefully unseal them and then eagerly read the messages of love, reassurance, and advice from my parents. I savored every line and felt, for those moments, closer to home and closer to my parents’ love, and I received the courage I needed to continue on for another week.

There is much in the natural course of mortal life that can make us feel alone and afraid, even while we are surrounded by people, as I was at boarding school. And we all feel far from home at times. In fact, most of you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; far from home while you are here at BYU. Perhaps this is a relatively new and painful experience for you and you are still finding it hard to adjust. Homesickness may continue to gnaw at you. For others, maybe you’ve been away from home for several semesters, or even several years, and you’re accustomed to it. And, indeed, for some, perhaps being away from a situation in which you dealt with negative influences and difficult relationships has been a good thing and has given you a chance to begin to become the person you know you can be.

We don’t send those blue airmail letters much anymore to keep in touch with home, as email, cell phones, Facebook, Skype, and Twitter have replaced old-fashioned letter writing. But messages from home, messages of love and reassurance and guidance, however they arrive at your door or in your inbox, can have a powerful influence in steadying you along your journey while you are away from home. They remind you that you are loved and cherished. Letters, cards, texts, emails, and phone calls from Mom and Dad, brothers and sisters, grandparents, relatives, and friends go a long way to help us when we face challenges and adversity far from the comforts of home. I still gain strength and comfort from a phone call home to my mother in England. She is now ninety years old.

Of course in so many ways we are all far from home. The metaphor here with our eternal home is clear. We know we were blessed to be in the presence of our Father in Heaven, our Savior, and “many of the noble and great ones” (Abraham 3:22) in our premortal existence. We know we received our “first lessons” (D&amp;amp;C 138:56) from them and had many opportunities “to choose good or evil” and to “[exercise] exceedingly great faith” (Alma 13:3). We know we are here on earth to be proven, “to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]” (Abraham 3:25). Do you ever feel homesick and long for your eternal home and for the love and affirmation and pure truth and light we know exist there? Don’t our spirits yearn to be where they know they belong best, there in the presence of our Father, “encircled about eternally in the arms of his love” (2 Nephi 1:15)?

Our Eternal Father has not let any of us leave home, leave His presence, without the opportunity to access His love and His guidance—every day of our lives. President Henry B. Eyring assures us, “[The Father] offers us, through prayer in the name of His Son, the opportunity to commune with Him in this life &lt;i&gt;as often as we choose”&lt;/i&gt; (“Exhort Them to Pray,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; February 2012, 4; emphasis added). Sometimes we forget this. Sometimes we doubt this. Sometimes we cut ourselves off from it. But He has endowed us all with the Light of Christ to enable us to judge right from wrong, to determine light from darkness and truth from error (see Moroni 7:16). As we repeatedly respond to the Light of Christ and train ourselves to “lay hold upon every good thing” (Moroni 7:19), we increase our sensitivity to the things of the Spirit and enhance our ability to receive the messages coming to us from our eternal home. As often as we sincerely seek and are worthy to receive, our Eternal Father communicates with us through revelation—messages that come to us in the reflective moments of prayer, through the words and enlightenment of the scriptures, from the teachings of the prophets, or in the peaceful melodies of heavenly music. His messages are often quiet, and we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; know that we can miss them if we are not ready to receive.

In fact, it is often &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; we are so busy receiving other messages that we impair our ability to receive the much-needed messages from our eternal home. We now live in a world in which messages surround us, even bombard us. Our smartphones, our computers, and our tablets are constantly buzzing, beeping, and vibrating with every new text, social media update, email, and photograph. It really is instant and insistent messaging.

This extraordinary technology, of course, can do enormous good. One example of that is how the glorious message of the gospel of Jesus Christ can be shared, streamed, and received through every kind of handheld device. But we must be selective in the messages we choose to receive. It is vital to our spiritual well-being that we do not consume so much of our time receiving good messages, or even better messages, that we make ourselves unavailable to receive the best messages (see Dallin H. Oaks, “Good, Better, Best,”&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2007, 104–8).

Just as I could not will one of those blue airmail letters from my mother to appear every morning at breakfast time, we cannot force messages from our eternal home. The Lord decides when and how and what to communicate with us. It is true that “every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth” (Luke 11:10), but we must remember and take heart in the fact that “it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will” (D&amp;amp;C 88:68). We cannot demand messages of the Lord. We must wait upon Him. But even as we wait upon Him, we continue to pursue Him and to persist in our petitions.

Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:

&lt;i&gt;Revelation is not a matter of pushing buttons, but of pushing ourselves, often aided by fasting, scripture study, and personal pondering.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Revelation requires us to have a sufficient degree of personal righteousness, so that on occasion revelation may come to the righteous, unsolicited.&lt;/i&gt; [“Revelation,” &lt;i&gt;First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,&lt;/i&gt; 11 January 2003 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003), 5]

There have been reminders recently of the golden age of manned space flight, particularly of the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s. These missions were incredible feats of science and engineering. The crew members were the brightest and most able of their class, launched into space atop the Saturn V rocket, still the most powerful machine ever made by man. Before they could land on the moon, however, their spacecraft had to be slowed to enter a lunar orbit. This meant doing something that—as with so much of this endeavor—had never been done before. And that was to travel around the far side, or so-called dark side, of the moon.

All the way there the crew had been able to be in constant radio contact with mission control in Houston. But when it came time for them to go around the far side of the moon, communication would be lost, as the moon would quite literally be between the spacecraft and the earth. All of the science, all of the engineering, and all of the collective intelligence of the most gifted and dedicated practitioners of this groundbreaking endeavor had not been able to come up with a way for them to communicate while they were around the dark side of the moon. So for forty-five agonizing minutes, all communication was lost with the crew. All they could do at mission control in Houston was wait and hope and wait and pray as each of those forty-five minutes ticked tensely by. What if a problem arose and there were a malfunction of some kind? How would mission control know, and how could they possibly help?

Well, the spacecraft did emerge from around the far side of the moon, the radio signal was reacquired, and mission control must have erupted with shouts of relief and joy as the safety of the crew was confirmed.

And so it can so easily be for us. We can be, like those astronauts, astonishingly bright, capable, and gifted in our own ways—shooting for the moon. We can have had the most extraordinary learning experiences and been given remarkable opportunities for growth in our lives. Perhaps we have received exceptional teaching and training from parents, teachers, mission presidents, and leaders and have come far and learned much. We will have caught glimpses of our eternal potential, of our mission here on earth in this mortal phase of our existence. But in order to continue our progression on the course the Lord would have us set, and in order to return safely to our eternal home, we must remain in constant communication with Him. If we place barriers between ourselves and the source of that critical communication—revelation from our Heavenly Father—we will be unable to receive the messages of guidance we need from Him.

Problems will arise and malfunctions will occur as our mortal lives take their natural course. When they do, will we find that we have cut ourselves off from the one true source of our guidance and direction?

On this Valentine’s Day, let us examine the condition of our hearts and how we are doing in receiving the messages of love, guidance, correction, and revelation from our Father, the great God and Creator of this universe. What barriers do we put between ourselves and the Lord? Do we sometimes figuratively place ourselves on the dark side of the moon, where we cannot hear from mission control?

There are many conditions of our hearts that may affect our ability to tune in to and receive the messages from our Heavenly Father. I will touch upon only three:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Our hearts may be burdened by the cares of daily life and the clamor of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Our hearts may be hardened by sin or unworthiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Our hearts may be malnourished by a poor digital diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First: Our Hearts May Be Burdened by the Cares of Daily Life and the Clamor of the World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We may not mean to do it, we may not even &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; we are doing it, but occasionally we can put ourselves around the dark side of the moon when our hearts become overburdened by the worries, pressures, irritations, and deadlines of daily life. We may not be facing anything all that unusual or experiencing a particularly stretching challenge, but our hearts can become blocked from the peace and comfort the Lord would give us because we are just too troubled and concerned. When we stay up too late and work too hard in order to meet our daily demands, fatigue sets in, we become overtired, and then the world looks to us a much gloomier place; things get out of perspective and out of proportion. There are papers to write, exams to take, research to do, jobs to fulfill, and maybe children to care for. There will be financial worries, family concerns, and questions of the soul over where to go next or what to do when this phase of life is complete. And on &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; day, how could I &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; make reference to the worries over dates, or the lack thereof; concerns over whether to become engaged; or indeed the want for such an opportunity.

You may not even realize just how much the noise and busyness of the world around you affects how you feel and alters your ability to hear and receive the messages your Eternal Father has for you.

When you are feeling overwhelmed and overburdened, it seems impossible to find a way or a time to slow down, find a quiet space, and draw close to your Heavenly Father. Just the mere suggestion that you might carve out some time from your already overscheduled day increases the sense of pressure you feel. You may doubt that choosing to spend that segment of quiet time will actually yield enough benefit and so think your time is better spent getting on with something else. However, that’s when problems arise and small glitches can turn into a major malfunction.

President Boyd K. Packer teaches a vital truth with regard to our hearts being burdened by the cares and clamor of daily life. He says:

&lt;i&gt;The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that &lt;/i&gt;if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.

&lt;i&gt;Occasionally, it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come &lt;/i&gt;seeking and listening. [“The Quest for Spiritual Knowledge,” &lt;i&gt;New Era,&lt;/i&gt; January 2007, 4; emphasis added]

We must each find and then guard a time each and every day to remember these words of the Lord: “All flesh is in mine hands; &lt;i&gt;be still&lt;/i&gt; and know that I am God” (D&amp;amp;C 101:16; emphasis added). A segment of time when we can be &lt;i&gt;still,&lt;/i&gt; quiet, and removed from our busyness will help recenter us, refocus our priorities, and bring us back into a position in which we can receive and feel the messages our Heavenly Father wishes to send to us. Remember, if our hearts are preoccupied, we may not be able to feel Father’s messages. His voice “[is] not a harsh voice, neither [is] it a loud voice; nevertheless, . . . it being a small voice it [does] pierce them that . . . hear to the center, . . . to the very soul, and [does] cause their hearts to burn” (3 Nephi 11:3). When we make ourselves ready and take the step of faith to put Him first at some point in our day (and why not first?), we find peace even in the midst of an otherwise hectic schedule. But we must make the choice to make it happen by putting Him first.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second: Our Hearts May Be Hardened by Sin or Unworthiness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
There can be no doubt that hearts carrying sin and unworthiness place barriers between themselves and God. Sometimes a heart can carry sin for so long that it becomes desensitized to spiritual things and becomes incapable of receiving and feeling the messages of the Lord. If there is something you carry in your heart today that is blocking you—in any degree—from truly connecting with your Heavenly Father and feeling His love and His plan for you, resolve now to put it right, let it go, give it up, or throw it out. Hearts become hardened by unworthiness, particularly when we continue to live as if that unworthiness is not actually there. This is compounded and complicated when we partake of the sacrament or participate in other ordinances as if our hearts were clean when really they are not.

Nephi teaches a beautiful truth when he says:

&lt;i&gt;The Lord God worketh not in darkness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He doeth not &lt;/i&gt;anything&lt;i&gt; save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Nephi 26:23–24; emphasis added]

In the spirit of that loving, tender reminder that He does nothing save it be for our benefit and that He laid down His life that He might draw each of us unto Him, the Savior Himself says:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 59:5]

What is holding you back from giving Him your whole heart, your whole mind, and all your strength?

Let your hearts &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; the reality of Lehi’s teaching about your perfectly loving and perfectly forgiving Savior: “Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit” (2 Nephi 2:7). He offered Himself as a sacrifice for &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; and His suffering can answer the ends of the law for &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; “Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). Can we ever hear this promise too often?

These scriptures, and many others, can bring you the strength and the determination to act, to change, to repent, and to offer up to the Lord your broken heart and contrite spirit. He offered up His life for you. You can offer back your heart.

“I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men” (D&amp;amp;C 64:22).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third: Our Hearts May Be Malnourished by a Poor Digital Diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We may be suffering in many aspects of our lives, without fully recognizing it, because of a poor digital diet. As with so much in life, what we consume is a choice, so don’t be surprised that if you spend much of your time consuming one kind of message that you become affected and influenced by it. Spending too much of our time with social media, celebrity or entertainment news, games, and the pursuit of online, time-hungry activities constitutes a poor digital diet. When we choose to consume the attitudes and opinions of the mass media, we will find our own values and viewpoints following suit, and most of the time we don’t even realize it is happening. We tell ourselves we’re not being affected by these messages, but that is not possible.

Elder David A. Bednar posed these questions:

&lt;i&gt;1. Does the use of various technologies and media invite or impede the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost in your life?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;2. Does the time you spend using various technologies and media enlarge or restrict your capacity to live, to love, and to serve in meaningful ways?&lt;/i&gt; [“Things as They Really Are,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; June 2010, 23]

A lot of the time we know what we need to change in our digital diet, but we don’t do it. We say we’re going to start tomorrow (don’t diets always start “tomorrow”?), but there is little worth in saying that. The time to act is now. Otherwise we are bound by our own behavior and lack of grit to change it.

We also need to be aware that many of today’s messages in the media can cause us to doubt our faith, compromise our convictions, and view the world through cynical eyes. But we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; deflect deceptive messages with our faith intact if we are connected in a vibrant, continuous stream to the source of truth, to the source of light. If we have questions or doubts, &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; get our answers from the Father and Creator of this universe through the delicate and precious channels of revelation that operate when we remove all barriers to our hearts. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; choose to “look to God and live” (Alma 37:47).

I love what President Boyd K. Packer has taught. He said, “We are not obedient because we are &lt;i&gt;blind,&lt;/i&gt; we are obedient because we can&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt;” (“Agency and Control,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1983, 66; emphasis added).

I recently experienced a reminder to watch my own digital diet when I had been consumed with a particular strand of news stories one day. I had a sense that I had spent too much time on it, but it was only when later I picked up a book by Elder Dallin H. Oaks and read a few chapters that I became acutely aware of the contrast. The difference between the feelings that I experienced was like the contrast between night and day. The news I had been so consumed with left me feeling unsettled and uneasy whilst the book brought me peace and a sense of order and calm. This seems to be a lesson we need to learn several times over.

Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:

&lt;i&gt;Never mind if the world doesn’t understand or even mocks this sacred process&lt;/i&gt; [of revelation]. &lt;i&gt;Paul said, “The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned” (1 Corinthians 2:14).&lt;/i&gt; [“Revelation,” 5]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
We believe that we are that we might have joy (see 2 Nephi 2:25), and that means joy here and now—today!—as well as in eternity. It is hard for us to feel joy, however, when we make choices that block the very messages that bring it to us.

As you examine the condition of your heart and the barriers you may be putting in the way of your communication with God, &lt;i&gt;you will know what you need to do. You will know what you need to change. I invite you to act now.&lt;/i&gt; Be bold in choosing to remove any obstruction to the sweet, comforting, guiding messages of love from your Father in Heaven.

The most important message any of us could receive or carry is a reminder of who we are and how we are loved by our Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. When the truth and reality of this message sink deep into our hearts, we cannot remain around the dark side of the moon. We are drawn back to Them—back to Their love, back to Their light, and back to Their arms.

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf fervently declared:

&lt;i&gt;Brothers and sisters, the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit. He knows you. He loves you with a perfect love.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . He wants you to know that &lt;/i&gt;you matter to Him. [“You Matter to Him,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2011, 22; emphasis added]

My witness to you today is that your Eternal Father in Heaven is real. He lives, and He loves you, adores you, and cherishes you—every single one of you, especially those of you who are thinking, “Well, not me.” Especially those of you who may be thinking, “Well, not me.” He especially loves you.

Jesus Christ is His Son, His gift to us all, the Savior of all mankind.

I conclude with the words of President Thomas S. Monson:

&lt;i&gt;Remember that one with authority placed his hands on your head at the time of your confirmation and said, “Receive the Holy Ghost.” &lt;/i&gt;Open your hearts,&lt;i&gt; even your very souls, to the sound of that special voice which &lt;/i&gt;testifies of truth.&lt;i&gt; As the prophet Isaiah promised, “Thine ears shall hear a word . . . saying, &lt;/i&gt;This is the way, walk ye in it”&lt;i&gt; (Isaiah 30:21).&lt;/i&gt; [“Be Thou an Example,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt;May 2005, 113; emphasis added]

In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Happy Valentine’s Day! This is a day when we celebrate love. We think of love letters and hearts, roses and chocolate. Many hope today to <i>receive</i> a message from one they love, and some are planning to <i>deliver</i> a message to one they love. I hope you won’t be disappointed.</p>
<p>My parents loved me dearly—of that I had no doubt. But when I was ten years old, I had to attend boarding school in England while my parents continued to live thousands of miles away in Saudi Arabia. The separation was an enormous wrench for me.</p>
<p>On the long flight to England, I remember feeling queasy in the pit of my stomach as I left behind the heat and sunshine of Arabia, flew across the miles, and descended through multiple layers of cloud into the cold, gray scene of London’s Heathrow Airport. The rain droplets on the airplane window shot past, and I felt so very, very far from home.</p>
<p>I arrived at the school in my uniform of gray shorts, sweater, tie, and cap, pulling my great, green trunk of belongings behind me. The loneliness was overwhelming.</p>
<p>I slept in a dormitory with about fifteen other boys. It was a very foreign experience, complete with rickety, metal-framed beds and the occasional pillow fight. Every morning after making our beds, we boys would stand aside while our bed-making skills and “hospital corners” were graded. There were unfamiliar smells, unfamiliar foods, and <i>very</i> unfamiliar teachers. My Latin master would walk around the room and peck our heads with the tip of his ballpoint pen if we didn’t know an answer. And I was very well pecked.</p>
<p>Out on the fields during our sports time, on a rare clear day, if a plane was flying high overhead, leaving a vapor trail, I would study its course to see if that plane might be heading back to Arabia—feeling a deep pang if it was. I longed, somehow, to jump aboard and go back home to my parents.</p>
<p>The brightest spot in any week came during breakfast time when mail was delivered. I would look anxiously for the telltale blue airmail letter that my mother sent faithfully every week. As the teachers came around the tables with letters to hand out, I would literally be on the edge of my bench waiting to see if one was for me. In so many senses this was Hogwarts, but without the owls and with none of the magic.</p>
<p>The blue airmail letters were often the highlight of my week, particularly in those early days when my loneliness was most acute. I would receive letters from home with such happiness and relief. I would wait until I could be alone to carefully unseal them and then eagerly read the messages of love, reassurance, and advice from my parents. I savored every line and felt, for those moments, closer to home and closer to my parents’ love, and I received the courage I needed to continue on for another week.</p>
<p>There is much in the natural course of mortal life that can make us feel alone and afraid, even while we are surrounded by people, as I was at boarding school. And we all feel far from home at times. In fact, most of you <i>are</i> far from home while you are here at BYU. Perhaps this is a relatively new and painful experience for you and you are still finding it hard to adjust. Homesickness may continue to gnaw at you. For others, maybe you’ve been away from home for several semesters, or even several years, and you’re accustomed to it. And, indeed, for some, perhaps being away from a situation in which you dealt with negative influences and difficult relationships has been a good thing and has given you a chance to begin to become the person you know you can be.</p>
<p>We don’t send those blue airmail letters much anymore to keep in touch with home, as email, cell phones, Facebook, Skype, and Twitter have replaced old-fashioned letter writing. But messages from home, messages of love and reassurance and guidance, however they arrive at your door or in your inbox, can have a powerful influence in steadying you along your journey while you are away from home. They remind you that you are loved and cherished. Letters, cards, texts, emails, and phone calls from Mom and Dad, brothers and sisters, grandparents, relatives, and friends go a long way to help us when we face challenges and adversity far from the comforts of home. I still gain strength and comfort from a phone call home to my mother in England. She is now ninety years old.</p>
<p>Of course in so many ways we are all far from home. The metaphor here with our eternal home is clear. We know we were blessed to be in the presence of our Father in Heaven, our Savior, and “many of the noble and great ones” (Abraham 3:22) in our premortal existence. We know we received our “first lessons” (D&amp;C 138:56) from them and had many opportunities “to choose good or evil” and to “[exercise] exceedingly great faith” (Alma 13:3). We know we are here on earth to be proven, “to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]” (Abraham 3:25). Do you ever feel homesick and long for your eternal home and for the love and affirmation and pure truth and light we know exist there? Don’t our spirits yearn to be where they know they belong best, there in the presence of our Father, “encircled about eternally in the arms of his love” (2 Nephi 1:15)?</p>
<p>Our Eternal Father has not let any of us leave home, leave His presence, without the opportunity to access His love and His guidance—every day of our lives. President Henry B. Eyring assures us, “[The Father] offers us, through prayer in the name of His Son, the opportunity to commune with Him in this life <i>as often as we choose”</i> (“Exhort Them to Pray,” <i>Ensign,</i> February 2012, 4; emphasis added). Sometimes we forget this. Sometimes we doubt this. Sometimes we cut ourselves off from it. But He has endowed us all with the Light of Christ to enable us to judge right from wrong, to determine light from darkness and truth from error (see Moroni 7:16). As we repeatedly respond to the Light of Christ and train ourselves to “lay hold upon every good thing” (Moroni 7:19), we increase our sensitivity to the things of the Spirit and enhance our ability to receive the messages coming to us from our eternal home. As often as we sincerely seek and are worthy to receive, our Eternal Father communicates with us through revelation—messages that come to us in the reflective moments of prayer, through the words and enlightenment of the scriptures, from the teachings of the prophets, or in the peaceful melodies of heavenly music. His messages are often quiet, and we <i>all</i> know that we can miss them if we are not ready to receive.</p>
<p>In fact, it is often <i>because</i> we are so busy receiving other messages that we impair our ability to receive the much-needed messages from our eternal home. We now live in a world in which messages surround us, even bombard us. Our smartphones, our computers, and our tablets are constantly buzzing, beeping, and vibrating with every new text, social media update, email, and photograph. It really is instant and insistent messaging.</p>
<p>This extraordinary technology, of course, can do enormous good. One example of that is how the glorious message of the gospel of Jesus Christ can be shared, streamed, and received through every kind of handheld device. But we must be selective in the messages we choose to receive. It is vital to our spiritual well-being that we do not consume so much of our time receiving good messages, or even better messages, that we make ourselves unavailable to receive the best messages (see Dallin H. Oaks, “Good, Better, Best,”<i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 104–8).</p>
<p>Just as I could not will one of those blue airmail letters from my mother to appear every morning at breakfast time, we cannot force messages from our eternal home. The Lord decides when and how and what to communicate with us. It is true that “every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth” (Luke 11:10), but we must remember and take heart in the fact that “it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will” (D&amp;C 88:68). We cannot demand messages of the Lord. We must wait upon Him. But even as we wait upon Him, we continue to pursue Him and to persist in our petitions.</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:</p>
<p><i>Revelation is not a matter of pushing buttons, but of pushing ourselves, often aided by fasting, scripture study, and personal pondering.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Revelation requires us to have a sufficient degree of personal righteousness, so that on occasion revelation may come to the righteous, unsolicited.</i> [“Revelation,” <i>First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</i> 11 January 2003 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003), 5]</p>
<p>There have been reminders recently of the golden age of manned space flight, particularly of the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s. These missions were incredible feats of science and engineering. The crew members were the brightest and most able of their class, launched into space atop the Saturn V rocket, still the most powerful machine ever made by man. Before they could land on the moon, however, their spacecraft had to be slowed to enter a lunar orbit. This meant doing something that—as with so much of this endeavor—had never been done before. And that was to travel around the far side, or so-called dark side, of the moon.</p>
<p>All the way there the crew had been able to be in constant radio contact with mission control in Houston. But when it came time for them to go around the far side of the moon, communication would be lost, as the moon would quite literally be between the spacecraft and the earth. All of the science, all of the engineering, and all of the collective intelligence of the most gifted and dedicated practitioners of this groundbreaking endeavor had not been able to come up with a way for them to communicate while they were around the dark side of the moon. So for forty-five agonizing minutes, all communication was lost with the crew. All they could do at mission control in Houston was wait and hope and wait and pray as each of those forty-five minutes ticked tensely by. What if a problem arose and there were a malfunction of some kind? How would mission control know, and how could they possibly help?</p>
<p>Well, the spacecraft did emerge from around the far side of the moon, the radio signal was reacquired, and mission control must have erupted with shouts of relief and joy as the safety of the crew was confirmed.</p>
<p>And so it can so easily be for us. We can be, like those astronauts, astonishingly bright, capable, and gifted in our own ways—shooting for the moon. We can have had the most extraordinary learning experiences and been given remarkable opportunities for growth in our lives. Perhaps we have received exceptional teaching and training from parents, teachers, mission presidents, and leaders and have come far and learned much. We will have caught glimpses of our eternal potential, of our mission here on earth in this mortal phase of our existence. But in order to continue our progression on the course the Lord would have us set, and in order to return safely to our eternal home, we must remain in constant communication with Him. If we place barriers between ourselves and the source of that critical communication—revelation from our Heavenly Father—we will be unable to receive the messages of guidance we need from Him.</p>
<p>Problems will arise and malfunctions will occur as our mortal lives take their natural course. When they do, will we find that we have cut ourselves off from the one true source of our guidance and direction?</p>
<p>On this Valentine’s Day, let us examine the condition of our hearts and how we are doing in receiving the messages of love, guidance, correction, and revelation from our Father, the great God and Creator of this universe. What barriers do we put between ourselves and the Lord? Do we sometimes figuratively place ourselves on the dark side of the moon, where we cannot hear from mission control?</p>
<p>There are many conditions of our hearts that may affect our ability to tune in to and receive the messages from our Heavenly Father. I will touch upon only three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our hearts may be burdened by the cares of daily life and the clamor of the world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our hearts may be hardened by sin or unworthiness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our hearts may be malnourished by a poor digital diet.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>First: Our Hearts May Be Burdened by the Cares of Daily Life and the Clamor of the World</b></h2>
<p>We may not mean to do it, we may not even <i>know</i> we are doing it, but occasionally we can put ourselves around the dark side of the moon when our hearts become overburdened by the worries, pressures, irritations, and deadlines of daily life. We may not be facing anything all that unusual or experiencing a particularly stretching challenge, but our hearts can become blocked from the peace and comfort the Lord would give us because we are just too troubled and concerned. When we stay up too late and work too hard in order to meet our daily demands, fatigue sets in, we become overtired, and then the world looks to us a much gloomier place; things get out of perspective and out of proportion. There are papers to write, exams to take, research to do, jobs to fulfill, and maybe children to care for. There will be financial worries, family concerns, and questions of the soul over where to go next or what to do when this phase of life is complete. And on <i>this</i> day, how could I <i>not</i> make reference to the worries over dates, or the lack thereof; concerns over whether to become engaged; or indeed the want for such an opportunity.</p>
<p>You may not even realize just how much the noise and busyness of the world around you affects how you feel and alters your ability to hear and receive the messages your Eternal Father has for you.</p>
<p>When you are feeling overwhelmed and overburdened, it seems impossible to find a way or a time to slow down, find a quiet space, and draw close to your Heavenly Father. Just the mere suggestion that you might carve out some time from your already overscheduled day increases the sense of pressure you feel. You may doubt that choosing to spend that segment of quiet time will actually yield enough benefit and so think your time is better spent getting on with something else. However, that’s when problems arise and small glitches can turn into a major malfunction.</p>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer teaches a vital truth with regard to our hearts being burdened by the cares and clamor of daily life. He says:</p>
<p><i>The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that </i>if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.</p>
<p><i>Occasionally, it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come </i>seeking and listening. [“The Quest for Spiritual Knowledge,” <i>New Era,</i> January 2007, 4; emphasis added]</p>
<p>We must each find and then guard a time each and every day to remember these words of the Lord: “All flesh is in mine hands; <i>be still</i> and know that I am God” (D&amp;C 101:16; emphasis added). A segment of time when we can be <i>still,</i> quiet, and removed from our busyness will help recenter us, refocus our priorities, and bring us back into a position in which we can receive and feel the messages our Heavenly Father wishes to send to us. Remember, if our hearts are preoccupied, we may not be able to feel Father’s messages. His voice “[is] not a harsh voice, neither [is] it a loud voice; nevertheless, . . . it being a small voice it [does] pierce them that . . . hear to the center, . . . to the very soul, and [does] cause their hearts to burn” (3 Nephi 11:3). When we make ourselves ready and take the step of faith to put Him first at some point in our day (and why not first?), we find peace even in the midst of an otherwise hectic schedule. But we must make the choice to make it happen by putting Him first.</p>
<h2><b>Second: Our Hearts May Be Hardened by Sin or Unworthiness</b></h2>
<p>There can be no doubt that hearts carrying sin and unworthiness place barriers between themselves and God. Sometimes a heart can carry sin for so long that it becomes desensitized to spiritual things and becomes incapable of receiving and feeling the messages of the Lord. If there is something you carry in your heart today that is blocking you—in any degree—from truly connecting with your Heavenly Father and feeling His love and His plan for you, resolve now to put it right, let it go, give it up, or throw it out. Hearts become hardened by unworthiness, particularly when we continue to live as if that unworthiness is not actually there. This is compounded and complicated when we partake of the sacrament or participate in other ordinances as if our hearts were clean when really they are not.</p>
<p>Nephi teaches a beautiful truth when he says:</p>
<p><i>The Lord God worketh not in darkness.</i></p>
<p><i>He doeth not </i>anything<i> save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.</i> [2 Nephi 26:23–24; emphasis added]</p>
<p>In the spirit of that loving, tender reminder that He does nothing save it be for our benefit and that He laid down His life that He might draw each of us unto Him, the Savior Himself says:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.</i> [D&amp;C 59:5]</p>
<p>What is holding you back from giving Him your whole heart, your whole mind, and all your strength?</p>
<p>Let your hearts <i>feel</i> the reality of Lehi’s teaching about your perfectly loving and perfectly forgiving Savior: “Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit” (2 Nephi 2:7). He offered Himself as a sacrifice for <i>you,</i> and His suffering can answer the ends of the law for <i>you.</i> “Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (D&amp;C 58:42). Can we ever hear this promise too often?</p>
<p>These scriptures, and many others, can bring you the strength and the determination to act, to change, to repent, and to offer up to the Lord your broken heart and contrite spirit. He offered up His life for you. You can offer back your heart.</p>
<p>“I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men” (D&amp;C 64:22).</p>
<h2><b>Third: Our Hearts May Be Malnourished by a Poor Digital Diet</b></h2>
<p>We may be suffering in many aspects of our lives, without fully recognizing it, because of a poor digital diet. As with so much in life, what we consume is a choice, so don’t be surprised that if you spend much of your time consuming one kind of message that you become affected and influenced by it. Spending too much of our time with social media, celebrity or entertainment news, games, and the pursuit of online, time-hungry activities constitutes a poor digital diet. When we choose to consume the attitudes and opinions of the mass media, we will find our own values and viewpoints following suit, and most of the time we don’t even realize it is happening. We tell ourselves we’re not being affected by these messages, but that is not possible.</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar posed these questions:</p>
<p><i>1. Does the use of various technologies and media invite or impede the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost in your life?</i></p>
<p><i>2. Does the time you spend using various technologies and media enlarge or restrict your capacity to live, to love, and to serve in meaningful ways?</i> [“Things as They Really Are,” <i>Ensign,</i> June 2010, 23]</p>
<p>A lot of the time we know what we need to change in our digital diet, but we don’t do it. We say we’re going to start tomorrow (don’t diets always start “tomorrow”?), but there is little worth in saying that. The time to act is now. Otherwise we are bound by our own behavior and lack of grit to change it.</p>
<p>We also need to be aware that many of today’s messages in the media can cause us to doubt our faith, compromise our convictions, and view the world through cynical eyes. But we <i>can</i> deflect deceptive messages with our faith intact if we are connected in a vibrant, continuous stream to the source of truth, to the source of light. If we have questions or doubts, <i>we</i> get our answers from the Father and Creator of this universe through the delicate and precious channels of revelation that operate when we remove all barriers to our hearts. <i>We</i> choose to “look to God and live” (Alma 37:47).</p>
<p>I love what President Boyd K. Packer has taught. He said, “We are not obedient because we are <i>blind,</i> we are obedient because we can<i>see</i>” (“Agency and Control,” <i>Ensign,</i> May 1983, 66; emphasis added).</p>
<p>I recently experienced a reminder to watch my own digital diet when I had been consumed with a particular strand of news stories one day. I had a sense that I had spent too much time on it, but it was only when later I picked up a book by Elder Dallin H. Oaks and read a few chapters that I became acutely aware of the contrast. The difference between the feelings that I experienced was like the contrast between night and day. The news I had been so consumed with left me feeling unsettled and uneasy whilst the book brought me peace and a sense of order and calm. This seems to be a lesson we need to learn several times over.</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:</p>
<p><i>Never mind if the world doesn’t understand or even mocks this sacred process</i> [of revelation]. <i>Paul said, “The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned” (1 Corinthians 2:14).</i> [“Revelation,” 5]</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>We believe that we are that we might have joy (see 2 Nephi 2:25), and that means joy here and now—today!—as well as in eternity. It is hard for us to feel joy, however, when we make choices that block the very messages that bring it to us.</p>
<p>As you examine the condition of your heart and the barriers you may be putting in the way of your communication with God, <i>you will know what you need to do. You will know what you need to change. I invite you to act now.</i> Be bold in choosing to remove any obstruction to the sweet, comforting, guiding messages of love from your Father in Heaven.</p>
<p>The most important message any of us could receive or carry is a reminder of who we are and how we are loved by our Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. When the truth and reality of this message sink deep into our hearts, we cannot remain around the dark side of the moon. We are drawn back to Them—back to Their love, back to Their light, and back to Their arms.</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf fervently declared:</p>
<p><i>Brothers and sisters, the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit. He knows you. He loves you with a perfect love.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . He wants you to know that </i>you matter to Him. [“You Matter to Him,” <i>Ensign,</i> November 2011, 22; emphasis added]</p>
<p>My witness to you today is that your Eternal Father in Heaven is real. He lives, and He loves you, adores you, and cherishes you—every single one of you, especially those of you who are thinking, “Well, not me.” Especially those of you who may be thinking, “Well, not me.” He especially loves you.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is His Son, His gift to us all, the Savior of all mankind.</p>
<p>I conclude with the words of President Thomas S. Monson:</p>
<p><i>Remember that one with authority placed his hands on your head at the time of your confirmation and said, “Receive the Holy Ghost.” </i>Open your hearts,<i> even your very souls, to the sound of that special voice which </i>testifies of truth.<i> As the prophet Isaiah promised, “Thine ears shall hear a word . . . saying, </i>This is the way, walk ye in it”<i> (Isaiah 30:21).</i> [“Be Thou an Example,” <i>Ensign,</i>May 2005, 113; emphasis added]</p>
<p>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I was ten or eleven years old, my twin brother and I went on a hike up the mountain just north of Y Mountain. Together, with a few friends, we woke up early and climbed straight up the face and then scampered across the top to the peak overlooking Rock Canyon.
On our way back down we ran into a small rattlesnake. Being the excitable kids we were, we surrounded the poor creature and wouldn’t let it escape. We became so bold as to pick it up by the tail as it would try to slither away. We’d hold it for a second or two and then drop it when our nerves gave in. The potentially deadly consequence of our actions didn’t deter us from our foolishness.
When we got home, my mother asked me if everything went okay on the hike. I mumbled something about a rattlesnake. She then related to me that at about the same time we would have been fooling around with the snake, she had received a strong impression that we were in danger. She had knelt and prayed for us. I was astonished. How did she know we were in trouble? This is my earliest recollection of what has become many experiences in which my mother received specific inspiration from the Holy Ghost in the very moment she needed it. At the time it seemed mysterious to me—this idea of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. I wondered how it really worked. I understood that the Holy Ghost was a personage of spirit, but I puzzled over how He could be helping everyone at once.
Years later, during my freshman year at BYU, I found myself sitting in a Physics 122 class. One day we were discussing the theoretical limit of the speed of light—about 300,000,000 meters per second. For the non-physics majors, that’s more than 670 million miles per hour.
The professor said, “It is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel.” Then he paused and said, “But we know of something faster—the speed of prayer.” He reasoned that if God has a body as tangible as man’s, then He occupies a discreet place in the universe. And we believe we can instantaneously communicate with Him. So there must be something faster than the speed of light.
Again I found myself reflecting upon the nature of the power of the Holy Ghost. Keep in mind that this was in 1985, so there was no Internet and there were no smartphones or wireless networks that convey data all over the world to millions of people simultaneously in a matter of seconds. Today, with our current experience, it doesn’t even stretch our minds to imagine technology that is capable of sending instantaneous and personalized messages to millions—even billions—of people at the same time.
Celestial Technology
Today I’d like to discuss just a few of the things I have learned since my youth about the power of the Holy Ghost and the nature of truth. Obviously this won’t be a complete treatise on the Holy Ghost but a personal reflection. I humbly add my t</span>

My relationship to this campus goes far beyond my current titles or even my degrees from this institution. The only word that is intimate enough yet broad enough to encompass my connection to BYU is the word home. BYU is my home. I have lived within walking distance of this very spot more than I have lived anywhere else in the world. I am a child of BYU, not just because I received an undergraduate degree from here but because I was literally a child here—living with my parents and the rest of my family in Heritage Halls during summer pilgrimages to this campus when my father was completing his PhD.
I have learned on this campus, I have grown on this campus, and I have discovered great things about myself and about you on this campus. Much of my research is dedicated to observations of your generation, and, I have to admit, you have much to be proud of. A recent column in the New York Times Magazine noted that young people today are more averse to risky behavior than their parents were at the same age. Drug and alcohol use, smoking, and sexual activity have all been in sharp decline in your demographic during the past twenty years.1 Also, financial firm TD Ameritrade believes you are more financially savvy and better savers than your parents,2 and a study conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine suggests that your willingness to improve society at large may actually improve your eating habits.3 If these are the inclinations of our culture at large, I certainly believe that these trends would only be amplified among the student body of BYU.
All of this might come as a bit of a shock to your parents, who have spent so much time and effort getting you to eat your vegetables and shielding you from evil—but it does not come as a shock to me. I watch you; I see you doing good. I am acutely aware of my responsibility to add to and not detract from the spirit that you carry.
While you certainly deserve praise and recognition, you should also recognize that your generation has its own unique characteristics and challenges. For example, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to capture and maintain your attention. I know that many of you are multitasking at this very moment—doing homework, checking your Facebook account, answering emails, texting your friends about your lunch plans, or even shopping. All of these things are available to you here in the Marriott Center through the devices that we carry in our pockets; these tools and technologies are increasingly becoming vital parts of our work, our play, our families, and our very identities.
I’m addicted, too. If you would have told me at age thirty (just a little w</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When Mary Magdalene and “the other Mary” arrived at the empty tomb, they were greeted by an angel of the Lord who told them to “go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead.”1 Matthew, in chapter 28, goes on to state, “They departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.”2
Within a short period of time, we presume (remember, they were running), the message had been delivered, and the 11 disciples were again reunited with their Lord and Master. It was then that the Savior of the world gave His first postresurrection commandment to his disciples. He told them:
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.3
He didn’t tell them to visit with their neighbors or to try to tract out their communities; rather, he told them to go and “teach all nations.” I wonder if those 11 disciples or the other followers of Christ at the time stopped and asked either verbally or at least in their own minds and hearts, “So, how are we going to do this? We have these little fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee, and we don’t mind walking a distance or maybe riding a donkey or a camel to a neighboring village, but, really, we’re supposed to ‘teach all nations’?”
Now let’s fast-forward about 1,800 years. Tomorrow, April 6, marks a special anniversary for Latter-day Saints, as it was on that day that the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered with a small group in a farmhouse in western New York and organized the Church of Jesus Christ. Imagine how those six charter Church members must have felt when Joseph told them, “And, by the way, we’re going to take this gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world.” If they stopped to consider what he was saying, can you imagine how overwhelming and perhaps even unrealistic that charge must have felt to them and perhaps even to Joseph himself?
The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants states that “the voice of warning shall be unto all people”—not just to the followers of Joseph Smith, not just to the small gathering of Saints assembled at that special conference in 1831 where this particular revelation was given, but to “all people.”4
In the first and second verses at the beginning of the Doctrine and Covenants—verses that have become meaningful for me and my colleagues at BYU Broadcasting—the Lord stated:
Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.
For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.5</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Prophet Joseph Smith described “a welding link” that must exist between the past, the present, and the future if we are to be made perfect along with both our ancestors and our posterity (verse 18). He refers, of course, to the offering of the ordinances of exaltation so that we can present to the Lord “a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation” (D&amp;C 128:24).
Those who have done any family history work will know the great sense of fulfillment and gratitude that comes when we can learn enough about an ancestor that she ceases to be just another name with a death date to us and is resurrected in our minds as a living human being endowed with a unique personality and all the other human traits that help us develop a connection—or a welding link—to her.
In the emotional sense, this link may be something like the “taming” process that the fox described in Antoine de Saint-Exupé’s classic tale The Little Prince:
To me [the fox declared], you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world. [Antoine de Saint-Exupé, The Little Prince (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1943), 66]
Once we have “tamed” our ancestors, they are unique in all the world to us, and our attachment to them grows.
But what I want to propose to you today is that there may be additional essential forms of linkage between ourselves and our loved ones of both yesterday and tomorrow. Our predecessors lived lives very different from those that we are experiencing today, and it is an absolute reality that our posterity will inhabit a world very unlike the one we know—just as my mother, who is here today, born just 15 years after the Wright Brothers took a flying leap at Kitty Hawk, sees her great-grandson Andrew growing up in a world that none of the most creative science fiction writers of her day even began to imagine.
As we ponder the Lord’s injunctions to us in sections 88, 90, and 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants—where we are told to diligently study “good books” (D&amp;C 90:15), history, geography, languages, peoples, and virtually every other imaginable discipline—I can’t help but wonder whether the Lord in fact wants us to forge a link between the civilizations of the past and our own day and then to transmit them to our own progeny. Perhaps one of the welding links that will help each of us to be tethered more securely to our ancestors can be achieved by familiarizing ourselves with the cultures in which they were born, lived, married, wept, laughed,</span>
