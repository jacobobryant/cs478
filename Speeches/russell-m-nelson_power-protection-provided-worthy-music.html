  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a joy for my wife, Wendy, and me to be with you, my dear brothers and sisters. From the BYU Marriott Center in Utah, we are broadcasting to many congregations throughout the world. Thanks to each of you for being with us.

We extend a special welcome to those who will soon be finishing high school and are attending a CES fireside broadcast for the first time. As you enroll in institutions of higher learning and continue your education, I hope you will participate in institute classes so that you may have this strong spiritual resource to balance your secular learning. You will also have opportunities to attend future CES firesides such as this. Take advantage of those occasions. They will enlighten and encourage you.

The title of my message tonight is “Power and Protection Provided by Worthy Music.” This topic is especially applicable to young adults. As you know, people of your age have made many significant contributions as writers, composers, and connoisseurs of worthy music.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The power of worthy music was felt tonight as we sang these words in our opening hymn:

&lt;i&gt;Come, ye children of the Lord,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Let us sing with one accord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Let us raise a joyful strain&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To our Lord who soon will reign.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Through music we raised our voices in powerful praise and prayer.

Such a hymn provides a pattern of worship that is pleasing to God. His prophet taught us to “praise the Lord with singing, with music, . . . and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving” (D&amp;amp;C 136:28).

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Ogden Institute of Religion choir. Thank you, Brother Ritchie, Brother Simon, and members of the choir, for your magnificent music. It has not only honored the Lord, but it has also touched our hearts deeply.

As the choir sang “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross,” I was deeply moved. The message focuses on the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Written by the English poet Isaac Watts, those words bear repetition:

&lt;i&gt;When I survey the wondrous cross,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;On which the Prince of glory died,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;My richest gain I count but loss,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And pour contempt on all my pride.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Forbid it, Lord! that I should boast,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Save in the death of Christ my God:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;All the vain things that charm me most,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I sacrifice them to His blood.&lt;/i&gt;

. . .

&lt;i&gt;Were the whole realm of nature mine,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That were a present far too small;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Love so amazing, so divine,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Demands my soul, my life, my all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Indeed, Isaac Watts did demand much from himself. In his lifetime he wrote approximately 600 hymns. Two of his most productive years were between his graduation from school at age 20 and his taking a job teaching when he was 22. At that young age many great hymns flowed from him. Lyrics by Isaac Watts in our book of hymns include, among others, “Joy to the World,” “Sweet Is the Work,” and “He Died! The Great Redeemer Died.”

Even as a small boy, Isaac Watts had poetic potential.

&lt;i&gt;Once, during family prayers, he began to laugh. His father asked him why.&lt;/i&gt; [Isaac] &lt;i&gt;replied that he had heard a sound and opened his eyes to see a mouse climbing a rope in a corner, and had immediately thought,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;A little mouse for want of stairs&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;ran up a rope to say its prayers.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;His father thought this irreverent, and proceeded to administer&lt;/i&gt; [physical] &lt;i&gt;punishment, in the midst of which Isaac called out,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Father, father, mercy take,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;and I will no more verses make.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

I would like to comment on another song in our hymnbook. The text of “How Great Thou Art” was first written by a young minister in Sweden. His name was Carl Gustav Boberg. He was only 25 years old. After attending a church meeting, he walked two miles along the southeastern coast of Sweden in a thunderstorm. The experience inspired him to write the words, which were later translated into English by Stuart K. Hine:

&lt;i&gt;O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Consider all the works thy hands have made,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;How great thou art! How great thou art!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

On one occasion I was in a mission conference when a missionary with great compassion, with tears in his eyes, asked me, “Why did the Savior have to suffer so much?” I reached for our hymnbook, turned to this song, and answered his question with this verse:

&lt;i&gt;And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He bled and died to take away my sin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

Jesus suffered so much because of His love for you and me. What a message! Worthy music is powerful. It has power to make us humble, prayerful, and grateful.

Prophets through all generations have taught the importance of worthy music in our expressions of worship. A few citations from the scriptures may serve to illustrate.

An Old Testament scripture bids us to “make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise” (Psalm 98:4). In the Hebrew language, those words literally mean to &lt;i&gt;burst&lt;/i&gt; forth into song and to &lt;i&gt;shout&lt;/i&gt; for joy. Contrast that spirit of enthusiasm with scenes we may see at church when some sing only passively and without a spirit of joy.

A New Testament scripture counsels me and you to have a well of good music within:

&lt;i&gt;Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/i&gt; [Ephesians 5:19–20]

Another New Testament verse says, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you . . . ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (Colossians 3:16).

From the New Testament we also learn that the Lord and His Apostles concluded the Last Supper with a hymn before leaving for the Mount of Olives (see Matthew 26:30). That tradition continues in our day. Each time members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles meet in the temple, we begin with a hymn. It sets a sweet, spiritual tone for our deliberations.

The Book of Mormon teaches that one’s desire to sing praises to the Lord comes with one’s complete conversion to Him. Alma asked this penetrating question:

&lt;i&gt;I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 5:26]

Ammon later exclaimed:

&lt;i&gt;Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 26:8]

Complete conversion is the key to our experiencing God’s greatest blessings. In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read this expression from the Lord:

&lt;i&gt;For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 25:12]

In the preface to our book of hymns, the First Presidency has provided this statement:

&lt;i&gt;Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings. The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to endure to the end.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We hope to see an increase of hymn singing in our congregations. We encourage all members, whether musically inclined or not, to join with us in singing the hymns. We hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called upon to speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented powerfully and beautifully in verse. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Latter-day Saints should fill their homes with the sound of worthy music. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Worthy music also has the power to persuade. We learn this lesson from the writings of John Jaques. He was born in England in 1827, a son of Wesleyan Methodist parents. In his youth John earnestly sought the true religion. He studied intensively with Latter-day Saint missionaries and, at the age of 18, became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

&lt;i&gt;John’s austere father, upset upon hearing this news, wrote: “I wished you . . . to attend the Wesleyan Chapel. They [the Mormons] do not teach you . . . [to] honor and obey your parents. I . . . hope you will give up the idea of belonging to such a party. . . . It is fiction.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;John’s reply, written March 14, 1847, when he was but twenty years of age, included these words: “Dear Father: I would pray . . . that I may understand the things of the Kingdom of God and carry my ideas to you. . . . Since I [joined the Church] my eyes have been opened, and I have been able to understand the truth. I can bear testimony to the truth . . . of the doctrines . . . in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

Three years later, at age 23, John Jaques wrote the words to this hymn that we know and love:

&lt;i&gt;Oh say, what is truth? ’Tis the fairest gem&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That the riches of worlds can produce,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And priceless the value of truth will be when&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The proud monarch’s costliest diadem&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Is counted but dross and refuse.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yes, say, what is truth? ’Tis the brightest prize&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To which mortals or Gods can aspire.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;’Tis an aim for the noblest desire.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The sceptre may fall from the despot’s grasp&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When with winds of stern justice he copes.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the wreck of the fell tyrant’s hopes.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then say, what is truth? ’Tis the last and the first,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the limits of time it steps o’er.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tho the heavens depart and the earth’s fountains burst,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Eternal, unchanged, evermore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

John stood firm in his conviction of the truth. He remained true and faithful and ultimately served as assistant to the Church historian from 1889 until his death on June 1, 1900.

Music has a sweet power to promote unity and love in the family. Not only is it an important component of family home evenings, but it can exert a continuing influence for good well beyond times when children are small. For my gift to the family last Christmas, I prepared a compact-disc recording of musical memories. I sat at the piano and recorded a variety of music that I had sung or played to the children through the years. They liked it. Some of the grandchildren told me that the CD was “cool.”

To illustrate the enduring benefits of worthy music in the home, I have asked our available daughters to sing for you tonight. Since their childhood, they have enjoyed singing together.

Daughters, I’m going to introduce you. Perhaps each of you can wave to the congregation as I mention your name: Marsha Workman, Wendy Maxfield, Gloria Irion, Brenda Miles, Sylvia Webster, Julie Wittwer, Laurie Marsh, Rosalie Ringwood, and Marjorie Helsten.

Our son’s wife, Britney, would like to have been here, but she is excused. She had a baby 11 days ago. Two other voices are missing—our deceased daughter, Emily, and her angel mother, Dantzel. Perhaps they are looking in from their windows in heaven. Our son, Russell, and I also enjoy singing with them, but we will not impose that upon you tonight.

To illustrate the multigenerational merits of worthy music in the home, our daughters will be accompanied by two of their daughters: Katie Irion Owens on the piano and Rachel Miles on the flute. They will sing and play for you “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee.” After their music, I will resume my message.

[Elder Nelson’s daughters and granddaughters sang and played “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee.”]

Thank you so much, daughters and granddaughters. Wendy and I love you dearly, as do your husbands and your families.

Many of you folks will be able to influence music that is selected in Church services in the future. A few thoughts may be helpful to you. Remember, music has power to provide spiritual nourishment.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; It has healing power.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; It has power to facilitate worship; it allows us to contemplate the Atonement and the Restoration of the gospel with its saving principles and exalting ordinances. Music provides power for us to express prayerful thoughts and bear testimony of sacred truths.

Music has power to overcome language barriers. In my experience, some of the most moving congregational singing has been rendered in languages that are foreign to me. Yet it spoke strongly to my soul.

The purpose of music in our Church services is not for performance but for worship. Prayerfully selected compositions and excellent performances are appropriate in our worship services when and if members feel a spirit of worship and of revelation. Church music should be supportive of the Lord and His work and not attract attention to itself.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Worthy music not only has power, but it can also provide protection. For many years President Boyd K. Packer has taught this concept. He has often quoted another statement issued by the First Presidency many years ago:

&lt;i&gt;Music can be used to exalt and inspire or to carry messages of degradation and destruction. It is therefore important that as Latter-day Saints we at all times apply the principles of the gospel and seek the guidance of the Spirit in selecting the music with which we surround ourselves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

Brethren and sisters, wherever we are, we should carefully choose what we see and hear. Some of you would not knowingly tolerate pornography in your homes, yet you would allow music into your lives that can be just as devastating.

Many youth listen to music that can be described as loud and fast, becoming louder and faster. It aims to agitate, not to pacify; to excite more than to calm. Beware of that kind of music.

As you know, continued exposure to loud sounds will, in time, damage delicate organs of hearing. In like manner, if you overindulge in loud music, you will more likely become spiritually deaf. You may not be able to hear the still, small voice. A scripture states:

&lt;i&gt;The Lord your God . . . hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 17:45]

Do not degrade yourself with the numbing shabbiness and irreverence of music that is not worthy of you. Delete the rubbish from your minds and your iPods. Protect your own personal standards! Be selective! Be wise!

Do not allow unworthy, raucous music to enter your life. It is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; harmless. It can weaken your defense and allow unworthy thoughts into your mind and pave the way to unworthy acts. Please remember:

&lt;i&gt;That which&lt;/i&gt; [does] &lt;i&gt;not edify is not of God, and is darkness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That which is of God is light.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]

Dear brothers and sisters, please fill your minds with worthy sights and sounds. Cultivate your precious gift of the Holy Ghost. Protect it as the priceless gift that it is. Carefully listen for its quiet communication. You will be spiritually stronger if you do. You know the proverb “As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he” (Proverbs 23:7). As you control your thoughts, you control your actions. Indeed, worthy music can provide power and protection for your soul.

For the closing hymn for our fireside tonight, the Ogden LDS Institute of Religion choir will sing “Our Prayer to Thee.”&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; I wrote the words to that song as my prayerful feelings for our Father in Heaven. Please receive this prayer as part of my testimony that God is our Father and that we are His children. I know that He lives. Jesus is the Christ and the Head of this Church that bears His holy name. Joseph Smith is the Prophet of this dispensation. President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord’s prophet on the earth at this time. I so testify and express my love and blessing for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

&lt;i&gt;Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was delivered on 4 May 2008.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>It is a joy for my wife, Wendy, and me to be with you, my dear brothers and sisters. From the BYU Marriott Center in Utah, we are broadcasting to many congregations throughout the world. Thanks to each of you for being with us.</p>
<p>We extend a special welcome to those who will soon be finishing high school and are attending a CES fireside broadcast for the first time. As you enroll in institutions of higher learning and continue your education, I hope you will participate in institute classes so that you may have this strong spiritual resource to balance your secular learning. You will also have opportunities to attend future CES firesides such as this. Take advantage of those occasions. They will enlighten and encourage you.</p>
<p>The title of my message tonight is “Power and Protection Provided by Worthy Music.” This topic is especially applicable to young adults. As you know, people of your age have made many significant contributions as writers, composers, and connoisseurs of worthy music.</p>
<h2><b>Power</b></h2>
<p>The power of worthy music was felt tonight as we sang these words in our opening hymn:</p>
<p><i>Come, ye children of the Lord,</i></p>
<p><i>Let us sing with one accord.</i></p>
<p><i>Let us raise a joyful strain</i></p>
<p><i>To our Lord who soon will reign.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Through music we raised our voices in powerful praise and prayer.</p>
<p>Such a hymn provides a pattern of worship that is pleasing to God. His prophet taught us to “praise the Lord with singing, with music, . . . and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving” (D&amp;C 136:28).</p>
<p>I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Ogden Institute of Religion choir. Thank you, Brother Ritchie, Brother Simon, and members of the choir, for your magnificent music. It has not only honored the Lord, but it has also touched our hearts deeply.</p>
<p>As the choir sang “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross,” I was deeply moved. The message focuses on the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Written by the English poet Isaac Watts, those words bear repetition:</p>
<p><i>When I survey the wondrous cross,</i></p>
<p><i>On which the Prince of glory died,</i></p>
<p><i>My richest gain I count but loss,</i></p>
<p><i>And pour contempt on all my pride.</i></p>
<p><i>Forbid it, Lord! that I should boast,</i></p>
<p><i>Save in the death of Christ my God:</i></p>
<p><i>All the vain things that charm me most,</i></p>
<p><i>I sacrifice them to His blood.</i></p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><i>Were the whole realm of nature mine,</i></p>
<p><i>That were a present far too small;</i></p>
<p><i>Love so amazing, so divine,</i></p>
<p><i>Demands my soul, my life, my all.</i><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Indeed, Isaac Watts did demand much from himself. In his lifetime he wrote approximately 600 hymns. Two of his most productive years were between his graduation from school at age 20 and his taking a job teaching when he was 22. At that young age many great hymns flowed from him. Lyrics by Isaac Watts in our book of hymns include, among others, “Joy to the World,” “Sweet Is the Work,” and “He Died! The Great Redeemer Died.”</p>
<p>Even as a small boy, Isaac Watts had poetic potential.</p>
<p><i>Once, during family prayers, he began to laugh. His father asked him why.</i> [Isaac] <i>replied that he had heard a sound and opened his eyes to see a mouse climbing a rope in a corner, and had immediately thought,</i></p>
<p><i>A little mouse for want of stairs</i></p>
<p><i>ran up a rope to say its prayers.</i></p>
<p><i>His father thought this irreverent, and proceeded to administer</i> [physical] <i>punishment, in the midst of which Isaac called out,</i></p>
<p><i>Father, father, mercy take,</i></p>
<p><i>and I will no more verses make.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>I would like to comment on another song in our hymnbook. The text of “How Great Thou Art” was first written by a young minister in Sweden. His name was Carl Gustav Boberg. He was only 25 years old. After attending a church meeting, he walked two miles along the southeastern coast of Sweden in a thunderstorm. The experience inspired him to write the words, which were later translated into English by Stuart K. Hine:</p>
<p><i>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder</i></p>
<p><i>Consider all the works thy hands have made,</i></p>
<p><i>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,</i></p>
<p><i>Thy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed;</i></p>
<p><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,</i></p>
<p><i>How great thou art! How great thou art!</i><sup>4</sup></p>
<p>On one occasion I was in a mission conference when a missionary with great compassion, with tears in his eyes, asked me, “Why did the Savior have to suffer so much?” I reached for our hymnbook, turned to this song, and answered his question with this verse:</p>
<p><i>And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,</i></p>
<p><i>Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in,</i></p>
<p><i>That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,</i></p>
<p><i>He bled and died to take away my sin.</i><sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Jesus suffered so much because of His love for you and me. What a message! Worthy music is powerful. It has power to make us humble, prayerful, and grateful.</p>
<p>Prophets through all generations have taught the importance of worthy music in our expressions of worship. A few citations from the scriptures may serve to illustrate.</p>
<p>An Old Testament scripture bids us to “make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise” (Psalm 98:4). In the Hebrew language, those words literally mean to <i>burst</i> forth into song and to <i>shout</i> for joy. Contrast that spirit of enthusiasm with scenes we may see at church when some sing only passively and without a spirit of joy.</p>
<p>A New Testament scripture counsels me and you to have a well of good music within:</p>
<p><i>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</i></p>
<p><i>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> [Ephesians 5:19–20]</p>
<p>Another New Testament verse says, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you . . . ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (Colossians 3:16).</p>
<p>From the New Testament we also learn that the Lord and His Apostles concluded the Last Supper with a hymn before leaving for the Mount of Olives (see Matthew 26:30). That tradition continues in our day. Each time members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles meet in the temple, we begin with a hymn. It sets a sweet, spiritual tone for our deliberations.</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon teaches that one’s desire to sing praises to the Lord comes with one’s complete conversion to Him. Alma asked this penetrating question:</p>
<p><i>I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</i> [Alma 5:26]</p>
<p>Ammon later exclaimed:</p>
<p><i>Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.</i> [Alma 26:8]</p>
<p>Complete conversion is the key to our experiencing God’s greatest blessings. In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read this expression from the Lord:</p>
<p><i>For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</i> [D&amp;C 25:12]</p>
<p>In the preface to our book of hymns, the First Presidency has provided this statement:</p>
<p><i>Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings. The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to endure to the end.</i></p>
<p><i>We hope to see an increase of hymn singing in our congregations. We encourage all members, whether musically inclined or not, to join with us in singing the hymns. We hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called upon to speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented powerfully and beautifully in verse. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Latter-day Saints should fill their homes with the sound of worthy music. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.</i><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Worthy music also has the power to persuade. We learn this lesson from the writings of John Jaques. He was born in England in 1827, a son of Wesleyan Methodist parents. In his youth John earnestly sought the true religion. He studied intensively with Latter-day Saint missionaries and, at the age of 18, became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p><i>John’s austere father, upset upon hearing this news, wrote: “I wished you . . . to attend the Wesleyan Chapel. They [the Mormons] do not teach you . . . [to] honor and obey your parents. I . . . hope you will give up the idea of belonging to such a party. . . . It is fiction.”</i></p>
<p><i>John’s reply, written March 14, 1847, when he was but twenty years of age, included these words: “Dear Father: I would pray . . . that I may understand the things of the Kingdom of God and carry my ideas to you. . . . Since I [joined the Church] my eyes have been opened, and I have been able to understand the truth. I can bear testimony to the truth . . . of the doctrines . . . in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Three years later, at age 23, John Jaques wrote the words to this hymn that we know and love:</p>
<p><i>Oh say, what is truth? ’Tis the fairest gem</i></p>
<p><i>That the riches of worlds can produce,</i></p>
<p><i>And priceless the value of truth will be when</i></p>
<p><i>The proud monarch’s costliest diadem</i></p>
<p><i>Is counted but dross and refuse.</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, say, what is truth? ’Tis the brightest prize</i></p>
<p><i>To which mortals or Gods can aspire.</i></p>
<p><i>Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,</i></p>
<p><i>Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:</i></p>
<p><i>’Tis an aim for the noblest desire.</i></p>
<p><i>The sceptre may fall from the despot’s grasp</i></p>
<p><i>When with winds of stern justice he copes.</i></p>
<p><i>But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,</i></p>
<p><i>And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast</i></p>
<p><i>And the wreck of the fell tyrant’s hopes.</i></p>
<p><i>Then say, what is truth? ’Tis the last and the first,</i></p>
<p><i>For the limits of time it steps o’er.</i></p>
<p><i>Tho the heavens depart and the earth’s fountains burst,</i></p>
<p><i>Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,</i></p>
<p><i>Eternal, unchanged, evermore.</i><sup>8</sup></p>
<p>John stood firm in his conviction of the truth. He remained true and faithful and ultimately served as assistant to the Church historian from 1889 until his death on June 1, 1900.</p>
<p>Music has a sweet power to promote unity and love in the family. Not only is it an important component of family home evenings, but it can exert a continuing influence for good well beyond times when children are small. For my gift to the family last Christmas, I prepared a compact-disc recording of musical memories. I sat at the piano and recorded a variety of music that I had sung or played to the children through the years. They liked it. Some of the grandchildren told me that the CD was “cool.”</p>
<p>To illustrate the enduring benefits of worthy music in the home, I have asked our available daughters to sing for you tonight. Since their childhood, they have enjoyed singing together.</p>
<p>Daughters, I’m going to introduce you. Perhaps each of you can wave to the congregation as I mention your name: Marsha Workman, Wendy Maxfield, Gloria Irion, Brenda Miles, Sylvia Webster, Julie Wittwer, Laurie Marsh, Rosalie Ringwood, and Marjorie Helsten.</p>
<p>Our son’s wife, Britney, would like to have been here, but she is excused. She had a baby 11 days ago. Two other voices are missing—our deceased daughter, Emily, and her angel mother, Dantzel. Perhaps they are looking in from their windows in heaven. Our son, Russell, and I also enjoy singing with them, but we will not impose that upon you tonight.</p>
<p>To illustrate the multigenerational merits of worthy music in the home, our daughters will be accompanied by two of their daughters: Katie Irion Owens on the piano and Rachel Miles on the flute. They will sing and play for you “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee.” After their music, I will resume my message.</p>
<p>[Elder Nelson’s daughters and granddaughters sang and played “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee.”]</p>
<p>Thank you so much, daughters and granddaughters. Wendy and I love you dearly, as do your husbands and your families.</p>
<p>Many of you folks will be able to influence music that is selected in Church services in the future. A few thoughts may be helpful to you. Remember, music has power to provide spiritual nourishment.<sup>9</sup> It has healing power.<sup>10</sup> It has power to facilitate worship; it allows us to contemplate the Atonement and the Restoration of the gospel with its saving principles and exalting ordinances. Music provides power for us to express prayerful thoughts and bear testimony of sacred truths.</p>
<p>Music has power to overcome language barriers. In my experience, some of the most moving congregational singing has been rendered in languages that are foreign to me. Yet it spoke strongly to my soul.</p>
<p>The purpose of music in our Church services is not for performance but for worship. Prayerfully selected compositions and excellent performances are appropriate in our worship services when and if members feel a spirit of worship and of revelation. Church music should be supportive of the Lord and His work and not attract attention to itself.</p>
<h2><b>Protection</b></h2>
<p>Worthy music not only has power, but it can also provide protection. For many years President Boyd K. Packer has taught this concept. He has often quoted another statement issued by the First Presidency many years ago:</p>
<p><i>Music can be used to exalt and inspire or to carry messages of degradation and destruction. It is therefore important that as Latter-day Saints we at all times apply the principles of the gospel and seek the guidance of the Spirit in selecting the music with which we surround ourselves.</i><sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Brethren and sisters, wherever we are, we should carefully choose what we see and hear. Some of you would not knowingly tolerate pornography in your homes, yet you would allow music into your lives that can be just as devastating.</p>
<p>Many youth listen to music that can be described as loud and fast, becoming louder and faster. It aims to agitate, not to pacify; to excite more than to calm. Beware of that kind of music.</p>
<p>As you know, continued exposure to loud sounds will, in time, damage delicate organs of hearing. In like manner, if you overindulge in loud music, you will more likely become spiritually deaf. You may not be able to hear the still, small voice. A scripture states:</p>
<p><i>The Lord your God . . . hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words.</i> [1 Nephi 17:45]</p>
<p>Do not degrade yourself with the numbing shabbiness and irreverence of music that is not worthy of you. Delete the rubbish from your minds and your iPods. Protect your own personal standards! Be selective! Be wise!</p>
<p>Do not allow unworthy, raucous music to enter your life. It is <i>not</i> harmless. It can weaken your defense and allow unworthy thoughts into your mind and pave the way to unworthy acts. Please remember:</p>
<p><i>That which</i> [does] <i>not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i></p>
<p><i>That which is of God is light.</i> [D&amp;C 50:23–24]</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, please fill your minds with worthy sights and sounds. Cultivate your precious gift of the Holy Ghost. Protect it as the priceless gift that it is. Carefully listen for its quiet communication. You will be spiritually stronger if you do. You know the proverb “As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he” (Proverbs 23:7). As you control your thoughts, you control your actions. Indeed, worthy music can provide power and protection for your soul.</p>
<p>For the closing hymn for our fireside tonight, the Ogden LDS Institute of Religion choir will sing “Our Prayer to Thee.”<sup>12</sup> I wrote the words to that song as my prayerful feelings for our Father in Heaven. Please receive this prayer as part of my testimony that God is our Father and that we are His children. I know that He lives. Jesus is the Christ and the Head of this Church that bears His holy name. Joseph Smith is the Prophet of this dispensation. President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord’s prophet on the earth at this time. I so testify and express my love and blessing for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><i>Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was delivered on 4 May 2008.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Half a century ago Elder Adam S. Bennion of the Quorum of the Twelve was the assigned speaker at this devotional. His address was preceded by a stirring passage from Cavalleria Rusticana by Mascagni, performed by one of the university’s fine choral groups. Elder Bennion was so touched that he began his message with these words: “I will shorten my remarks today so that this musical masterpiece may be performed for us a second time at the close of this assembly.”
The nearer we get to God, the more easily our spirits are touched by refined and beautiful things. If we could part the veil and observe our heavenly home, we would be impressed with the cultivated minds and hearts of those who so happily live there. I imagine that our heavenly parents are exquisitely refined. In this great gospel of emulation, one of the purposes of our earthly probation is to become like them in every conceivable way so that we may be comfortable in the presence of heavenly parentage and, in the language of Enos, see their faces “with pleasure.”1
Brigham Young said: “We are trying to be the image of those who live in heaven; we are trying to pattern after them, to look like them, to walk and talk like them.”2 To prepare us to do this, the 13th article of faith encourages: “If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”3 Refinement is a companion to developed spirituality. Refinement and spirituality are two strings drawn by the same bow.
Today I would like to peek behind the veil that temporarily separates us from our heavenly home and paint a word picture of the virtuous, lovely, and refined circumstances that exist there. I will speak of the language, literature, music, and art of heaven, as well as the immaculate appearance of heavenly beings, for I believe that in heaven we will find each of these in pure and perfected form.
God speaks all languages, and He speaks them properly. He is restrained and modest of speech. When God described the grand creational process of this earth, He said in measured tones that “it was good.”4 We would be disappointed if God had to use “awesome” or other exaggerated phrases in every paragraph.
Britain’s Ben Jonson said: “Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee.”5 Our language reveals our thoughts, our virtues, our insecurities, our doubts, even the homes from which we come. We will feel more comfortable in Heavenly Father’s presence if we have developed proper habits of speech. We not only wish to see God’s face “with pleasure,” we want to open our mouths with confidence that our speech harmonizes with the refinement of heaven.
We will thrill to hear exalted beings express their sublime thoughts in perfectly chosen words. I suppose that the language of heaven, properly spoken, may approach a form of music. Did C. S. Lewis </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">How fortunate we are to sing “Our Savior’s Love” this morning. Two former members of the faculty, Crawford Gates and Edward Hart, collaborated in its creation. And how wonderful it is to be taught and edified by this superb Men’s Choir. To be reminded of the love and mission of Jesus Christ so vividly through music is truly a blessing. The music performed as we entered this facility quietly prepared our minds and hearts to receive this blessing. I am grateful for music and for all of the arts, for they give meaning and richness to life.
A Unique Institution
We are privileged to be associated with Brigham Young University. It was no idle dream that brought Brigham Young Academy into existence 125 years ago. Its founders had a clear vision of its destiny. We are here today because of their courage and sacrifice.
This year the College of Fine Arts and Communications is celebrating another important event: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the College of Fine Arts. The Department of Communications was added to the college about 35 years later. In a number of ways, and on varied occasions, we are honoring those who established a foundation for the arts and communications at BYU. As a special tribute to those faithful founders, I have chosen to speak about centering the arts in Christ.
It is a rare blessing to be associated with an institution that honors the central role of Jesus Christ in this world’s destiny. It was faith in Christ that motivated the founders of this institution. And that same faith guided those who established the arts as a core element of our curriculum. They followed the Light that leads all mankind toward things that are “virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy” (Articles of Faith 1:13). Most were also responding to the quiet invitation of the Holy Ghost to center the arts in Christ. In Mormon’s words:
I judge these things of [them] because of [their] peaceable walk with the children of men.
For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also. [Moroni 7:4–5]
Our Challenge
I offer my profound gratitude to all those faithful, sensitive women and men who loved beauty and truth enough to sacrifice their lives in service at this institution.
It is now our challenge to strengthen and extend their artistic work into the 21st century and beyond. Will we be willing to place Christ at the center of our work?
During the ministry of Jesus in Palestine, there were many who “believed on him; but . . . did not confess him, . . . for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God” (John 12:42–43). The same challenge exists today. Do we believe in Christ but fail to follow Him because we love the praise of men more than the praise of God? Or are we willing to follow Him but uncertain about wh</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">King Benjamin begins his powerful speech to his people with these words:
I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view. [Mosiah 2:9]
I quote that scripture not to set up the expectation that my address today will begin to compare to his, nor to caution you against trifling with my words, but to ask you to consider Benjamin’s entreaty for his people to listen not only with ears but also with hearts and minds.
You know that it is not just King Benjamin who uses these words. Many other prophets throughout scripture make frequent reference to, and coupling of, heartand mind. Often, especially in the Book of Mormon, the reference is a caution against hard hearts and blinded minds, but there are other references, some of which I will quote later, that encourage open minds and soft hearts as we strive to live the gospel.
The need for coupling minds that think, reason, and evaluate with hearts that perceive, feel, and experience has been on my mind a great deal, especially these last months. In fact, when I was asked to give this devotional address, the issue I wanted to consider was immediately clear to me.
One month from now the forty members of this past year’s edition of Brigham Young University Singers will reunite here for a week of intense rehearsals before departing for Australia, where we will be the United States’ representative to the Fourth International Choral Symposium. We will sing three concerts at the symposium, the first of which is to take place in the Sydney Opera House. You can imagine how a sense of intimidation has tried to overwhelm us in this opportunity to bring the name of Brigham Young University to this astute international gathering.
But we have countered such misgivings with a commitment to prepare ourselves for performances that are full of heart and mind, performances that will not only have the capacity to be aesthetically challenging and satisfying but also to bring the Spirit into the willing hearts and minds of those who listen.
I am gratified when issues of professional growth relate to an increase in knowledge of—and ability to live—the principles of the gospel. Music and gospel living are both very important to me. And as I speak, in this university community setting, from my expertise in music, I hope you will consider the parallels I attempt to establish between good music-making and gospel living—and then draw your own personal conclusions that will help you integrate, organize, and perhaps even simplify the important facets of your lives.
Just a moment ago you heard Veronica and Kaarin sing a beautiful American hymn that became much more meaningful to me as I learned its history.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am particularly appreciative of the music we’ve just heard, and quote from section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants:
For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads. [D&amp;C 25:12]
I very anxiously lay claim to those blessings from these righteous young men and women who have sung so beautifully this sacred hymn of Zion. My gratitude to them will, I’m sure, be more obvious when I move into the message that I have chosen to speak upon tonight.
I want to respond to a question that I face with some frequency. It has many variations, but the theme is this: Why do we not have more inspired and inspiring music in the Church? Or why do we have so few great paintings or sculptures depicting the Restoration? Why is it when we need a new painting for a bureau of information, or perhaps for a temple, frequently nonmember painters receive the commission? The same questions have an application to poetry, to drama, to dance, to creative writing, to all the fine arts.
Now, I’m sure there are those who will say, “Why does he presume to talk about that? He is uninformed. He is just out of his province.” It may comfort them to know that I know that. My credentials to speak do not come from being a musician, for I’m not. I am not a composer, nor a conductor, and certainly I am not a vocalist. I cannot, for example, play the piano. I would be very unwilling to do so. However, should I be pressed to it, I could, without much difficulty, prove my point. I am not adequate as an artist, nor as a sculptor, a poet, or a writer.
But then I do not intend to train you in any of those fields. My credentials, if I have any (some of them should be obvious), relate to spiritual things.
I hope for sufficient inspiration to comment on how the Spirit of the Lord influences or is influenced by the art forms that I have mentioned. Since I have been interested in these matters, I have, over the years, listened very carefully when they have been discussed by the Brethren. I have studied expressions of my Brethren and of those who have led us in times past, in order to determine how those questions should be answered.
The reason we have not yet produced a greater heritage in art and literature and music and drama is not, I am very certain, because we have not had talented people. For over the years we have had not only good ones but great ones. Some have reached great heights in their chosen fields. But few have captured the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the restoration of it in music, in art, in literature. They have not, therefore, even though they were gifted, made a lasting contribution to the onrolling of the Church and kingdom of God in the dispensation of the fulness of times. They have therefore missed doing what they might have done, and they have missed being what they might have bec</span>
