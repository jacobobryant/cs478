  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="In my current assignment as Historian and Recorder for the Church, I have the privilege of working with some incredibly bright people. The Church History Department is housed in the Church History Library, just east of the LDS Conference Center. In this building are located the archives that house a marvelous collection of documents, books, journals, correspondence, film, and other important artifacts. On the fourth floor is a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory where historical artifacts, documents, books, and even textiles are brought so they might be preserved or restored.

Let me share by video some of the work that goes on here: Emiline Twitchell is cleaning off old glue from a book spine that has become hard and inflexible. She is working on an early copy of a Welsh Pearl of Great Price. Katie Smith is removing damaging tape (a four-letter word in document conservation) from the first Relief Society Minute Book. She is also washing an early LDS Danish journal to restore it to its near original condition. Here she is sewing back together the original Mayfield, Utah, Relief Society Minute Book.

In older books the spine often breaks and needs replacing. Here Katie is preparing leather for a replacement spine for a book. This is called rebacking and involves adding new material under the original cover to compensate for the failing spine. Here you see she is working on a first-edition copy of the Book of Mormon that is undergoing this process of adding the leather to reinforce the spine. Finally, here is a finished book in which the spine has been reattached over the new material underneath. In this case the book is another Relief Society record from the nineteenth century.

Restoration work can be tedious and time consuming, but the results can be stunning. I am so pleased we have professionals who are dedicated to preserving our past by restoring these important elements of our history.

This is only part of the work of the Church History Department. Besides the library, where most of the precious documents, books, newspapers, and film are stored, the Church has the Church History Museum, where important artifacts are displayed and also stored. The Granite Mountain Records Vault acts as a storage facility for microfilm and digital records. We also have Church history advisors called who serve in their own countries around the world, collecting, preserving, and sharing Church history from their own lands. We work as well with the Missionary Department and other Church entities in the operation and preservation of the historic sites of the Church - from Palmyra, New York, to Martins Cove, Wyoming, and from Kirtland, Ohio, to the Mormon Battalion Visitors Center in San Diego, California.

In the past several years we have made a tremendous effort to provide Church history offerings online so the stories, documents, and journals might be shared with the entire Church without the necessity of coming to Church headquarters to view these treasures.

When the Church has so many priorities in its mission to bring the gospel to the world, some might ask why it is so important to preserve Church history. I would submit there are two fundamental reasons why we document our history.

First, it was commanded that "there shall be a record kept among you." Through the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord revealed the importance of keeping a record in the opening lines of Doctrine and Covenants 21:1. This revelation was given the day the Church was organized, and diligent historians since that time have faithfully exercised their duty to keep the history of the Church. This duty was considered so important that early Church historians carefully packed the records into crates and loaded them in covered wagons for the westward trek. When there was scarce room for supplies necessary to build a new life in the wilderness, these crates of records were packed instead of flour or tools. These same records are now housed in the archives of the Church History Library.

Second, our history is kept to help us remember. We gain strength from the stories of those who have gone before. We all must figuratively pull our own handcart through life. We learn from past generations how to be strong and what brings happiness and joy in our lives. We also learn that Gods children are not and never have been perfect and that He can accomplish His work through people just like you and me, even if we have obvious or hidden shortcomings.

As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said:

&lt;i&gt;Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with. That must be terribly frustrating to Him, but He deals with it. So should we.&lt;/i&gt; ["Lord, I Believe," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2013]

If you were fortunate enough to grow up in homes of faith, you were taught at an early age to pray, to study the scriptures, and to live the commandments. Your parents knew these admonitions were as important to your spiritual growth as other admonitions designed to keep you physically safe.

The prophets of God, just like parents, constantly exhorted the people of their time to remember. Nephi, speaking of his wicked brothers, said:

&lt;i&gt;I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.&lt;/i&gt; [1 Nephi 15:25]

And who does not recall the counsel of Alma to his son:

&lt;i&gt;O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.&lt;/i&gt; [Alma 37:35]

Certainly such a plea reflects the desire of every righteous parent.

After wandering in the wilderness for forty years, the Israelites were finally prepared to enter the promised land. As reported in Joshua, the Lord miraculously parted the waters of the river Jordan so they could pass into Israel on dry ground. Thereafter the people were commanded to take twelve stones and build a monument that could be prominently and perpetually seen. Why? It was so they would remember. In Joshua we read:

&lt;i&gt;That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.&lt;/i&gt; [Joshua 4:67]

We too place monuments to help us remember. The miracle of the seagulls, the suffering of the handcart pioneers, and the arrival of the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley are all examples of events and miracles remembered with monuments. Even on this campus monuments have been erected to help us remember the sacrifices of those who have gone before. But it is not just monuments we erect. As members of the restored Church we are encouraged to do certain things to help us remember:

a. We keep journals.

b. We attend the temple.

c. We offer prayers of gratitude.

d. We study our scriptures.

e. We attend Sunday School, institute, and seminary classes to study the gospel.

f. We partake of the sacrament.

Much of what we do as members of the Church helps form and strengthen our testimonies of the gospel. In addition, remembering spiritual experiences that touched our lives reinforces our faith. Learning of the spiritual strengths and sacrifices of others also helps us. Scriptural accounts, stories of ancestors and faithful pioneers, as well as the testimonies of faithful peers reinforce and strengthen our own testimonies of the gospel.

Today is a day of celebration that will always be a milestone in your lives. Some of you will begin your careers in your chosen field. Others will face board exams, bar exams, internships, or further graduate study. Wherever you are in your lifes journey, this is a day you will remember. I am not confident you will remember any of my words, but while I have your attention, I would like to remind you of a few things.

Remember to be grateful. You have received a wonderful education that is one of the best in higher education, both in its quality and its affordability. Thank your parents, family, and friends who have encouraged you. Many of you have been assisted financially by your loved ones, and all of you have been supported emotionally by them. They deserve your sincere gratitude. Give them a hug and tell them thanks.

In the future remember Brigham Young University and the Church that supports and underwrites it. When you are able, give generously to BYU and support its activities. Stand on the shoulders of those who have donated to make this institution what it is. You may not be able to have a building named after you, but you can support a scholarship fund to help future generations who are privileged to attend this university.

Remember the importance of relationships in your lives. You have made friends in your time here. You probably feel that maintaining these friendships over time will be effortless. You are mistaken. As you now scatter into the world, your lives will become very busy with the demands of your family, your friends, your profession, your community, and your Church service. You will lose track of one another unless you make an effort to stay in touch. Make that effort. You will find it incredibly rewarding. Fortunately, todays social media makes this a bit easier. Cherish these friendships and reach out. As the country song goes, "You cant make old friends" (Caitlyn Smith, Don Schlitz, and Ryan Hanna King, 2013). Keep them.

Remember your family. Your first priority is your immediate family or the family you will one day create. Nothing will bring you more happiness and joy than strong family relationships. Take care of your spouse, love your children, and give them your time. Reach out to extended family and nurture those relationships to help you and your children remember you are indeed part of a larger family unit.

The Snow tribe gathers each Fourth of July in the mountains of southern Utah. It is not a complicated family reunion. It is a one-day affair. We do the very same things each year. The menu even remains the same. For us it is an opportunity to spend time with those who have shaped our lives and made us who we are today. It is also a time for the next generation to make friends with cousins they do not otherwise see often. This time has become so popular with the new generation that some of the younger ones begin asking the afternoon of Christmas Day how long it is before the reunion.

Some of you have begun your own families. My wife, Phyllis, and I know what it is like to be married while in school. For six years we survived on macaroni and cheese, tuna fish, baloney, venison, and bottled peaches. We can recall when any purchase over three dollars demanded consultation. During many of my college years, every time I put on a Sunday suit I noticed baby slobber on the shoulder. Interestingly enough, we now look back on those times with great fondness. Living through them, however, is another thing entirely. Make certain you remember to thank your spouse for helping you be here today. Hopefully he or she has been able to achieve their educational goals as well. If not, there will come a time when you should shoulder some of the burden to make it possible for that to occur.

While this day is a major milestone in your life, trust me, the journey is just beginning. You cannot even imagine the adventures that lie ahead. I would encourage you to record that journey. Some of the most inspiring history comes from the diaries and journals of everyday people like you and me. You need not be a prominent Church leader and copious journal keeper like Wilford Woodruff or George Q. Cannon, but your story is important. Contribute to our body of history by keeping your own story. Your journal might not be highlighted in some future Church history display, but I can assure you it will be treasured by your children and grandchildren for many generations to come.

President Spencer W. Kimball said:

I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations. ["Hold Fast to the Iron Rod," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1978]

The truth of the matter is that if you dont write your story, it may not get written. Worse still, it might be told by someone else in a way you do not desire. The one who has the last word is the one who writes it down. Remember to keep a journal.

Remember to serve. Your family will keep you very busy, and Church service opportunities will come to you often in the future. Honor these callings and do your very best. Be a good parent, but as your time and circumstances permit, reach out to serve those in your neighborhood, your school district, or your community. I would echo the words of Dr. Albert Schweitzer:

&lt;i&gt;I dont know what your destiny will be, . . . but I know one thing: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.&lt;/i&gt; ["The Meaning of Ideals in Life," speech given at Silcoates School, Wakefield, England, 3 December 1935; translated from the French in "Visit of Dr. Albert Schweitzer," &lt;i&gt;The Silcoatian,&lt;/i&gt; New Series, no. 25 (December 1935): 78485, myhome.spu.edu/sperisho/SchweitzerInTheSilcoatian.pdf; see also liberlocorumcommunium.blogspot.com/2010/10/schweitzer-on-service.html]

Finally, remember the importance of faith in your life. Living gospel principles as best as you are able will immeasurably bless your life and the lives of your family members. Study, pray together as a family, and faithfully attend your worship services. Some days this will seem difficult, and the temptation will be to skip Church just this once. Do not fall into that trap. Be faithful in your Church attendance and serve well in the callings that come your way. Church service is not always convenient, but it will make you a better person, a better member of your family, and a better member of society. Dont let the demands of the world lead to compromises when it comes to your faith. Remember the spiritual experiences that have developed your testimony, live the gospel, teach your family gospel principles, and be a good example to them.

When it comes to faith, remembering is not enough. It is essential that you live so you are entitled to receive new spiritual experiences. Stay strong and stay close to the Spirit so you might be blessed with future spiritual experiences that will strengthen and enrich your faith. So when it comes to your faith, remember what you have learned and felt but also live worthily to renew your faith and testimony.

Remember to enjoy the journey. As President Gordon B. Hinckley once said, "Save your fork. The best is yet to come." I truly believe that, and I wish you a wonderful life as you leave here for the many wonderful adventures that lie ahead. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>In my current assignment as Historian and Recorder for the Church, I have the privilege of working with some incredibly bright people. The Church History Department is housed in the Church History Library, just east of the LDS Conference Center. In this building are located the archives that house a marvelous collection of documents, books, journals, correspondence, film, and other important artifacts. On the fourth floor is a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory where historical artifacts, documents, books, and even textiles are brought so they might be preserved or restored.</p>
<p>Let me share by video some of the work that goes on here: Emiline Twitchell is cleaning off old glue from a book spine that has become hard and inflexible. She is working on an early copy of a Welsh Pearl of Great Price. Katie Smith is removing damaging tape (a four-letter word in document conservation) from the first Relief Society Minute Book. She is also washing an early LDS Danish journal to restore it to its near original condition. Here she is sewing back together the original Mayfield, Utah, Relief Society Minute Book.</p>
<p>In older books the spine often breaks and needs replacing. Here Katie is preparing leather for a replacement spine for a book. This is called rebacking and involves adding new material under the original cover to compensate for the failing spine. Here you see she is working on a first-edition copy of the Book of Mormon that is undergoing this process of adding the leather to reinforce the spine. Finally, here is a finished book in which the spine has been reattached over the new material underneath. In this case the book is another Relief Society record from the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Restoration work can be tedious and time consuming, but the results can be stunning. I am so pleased we have professionals who are dedicated to preserving our past by restoring these important elements of our history.</p>
<p>This is only part of the work of the Church History Department. Besides the library, where most of the precious documents, books, newspapers, and film are stored, the Church has the Church History Museum, where important artifacts are displayed and also stored. The Granite Mountain Records Vault acts as a storage facility for microfilm and digital records. We also have Church history advisors called who serve in their own countries around the world, collecting, preserving, and sharing Church history from their own lands. We work as well with the Missionary Department and other Church entities in the operation and preservation of the historic sites of the Church - from Palmyra, New York, to Martins Cove, Wyoming, and from Kirtland, Ohio, to the Mormon Battalion Visitors Center in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>In the past several years we have made a tremendous effort to provide Church history offerings online so the stories, documents, and journals might be shared with the entire Church without the necessity of coming to Church headquarters to view these treasures.</p>
<p>When the Church has so many priorities in its mission to bring the gospel to the world, some might ask why it is so important to preserve Church history. I would submit there are two fundamental reasons why we document our history.</p>
<p>First, it was commanded that "there shall be a record kept among you." Through the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord revealed the importance of keeping a record in the opening lines of Doctrine and Covenants 21:1. This revelation was given the day the Church was organized, and diligent historians since that time have faithfully exercised their duty to keep the history of the Church. This duty was considered so important that early Church historians carefully packed the records into crates and loaded them in covered wagons for the westward trek. When there was scarce room for supplies necessary to build a new life in the wilderness, these crates of records were packed instead of flour or tools. These same records are now housed in the archives of the Church History Library.</p>
<p>Second, our history is kept to help us remember. We gain strength from the stories of those who have gone before. We all must figuratively pull our own handcart through life. We learn from past generations how to be strong and what brings happiness and joy in our lives. We also learn that Gods children are not and never have been perfect and that He can accomplish His work through people just like you and me, even if we have obvious or hidden shortcomings.</p>
<p>As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said:</p>
<p><i>Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with. That must be terribly frustrating to Him, but He deals with it. So should we.</i> ["Lord, I Believe," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2013]</p>
<p>If you were fortunate enough to grow up in homes of faith, you were taught at an early age to pray, to study the scriptures, and to live the commandments. Your parents knew these admonitions were as important to your spiritual growth as other admonitions designed to keep you physically safe.</p>
<p>The prophets of God, just like parents, constantly exhorted the people of their time to remember. Nephi, speaking of his wicked brothers, said:</p>
<p><i>I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.</i> [1 Nephi 15:25]</p>
<p>And who does not recall the counsel of Alma to his son:</p>
<p><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</i> [Alma 37:35]</p>
<p>Certainly such a plea reflects the desire of every righteous parent.</p>
<p>After wandering in the wilderness for forty years, the Israelites were finally prepared to enter the promised land. As reported in Joshua, the Lord miraculously parted the waters of the river Jordan so they could pass into Israel on dry ground. Thereafter the people were commanded to take twelve stones and build a monument that could be prominently and perpetually seen. Why? It was so they would remember. In Joshua we read:</p>
<p><i>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</i></p>
<p><i>Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</i> [Joshua 4:67]</p>
<p>We too place monuments to help us remember. The miracle of the seagulls, the suffering of the handcart pioneers, and the arrival of the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley are all examples of events and miracles remembered with monuments. Even on this campus monuments have been erected to help us remember the sacrifices of those who have gone before. But it is not just monuments we erect. As members of the restored Church we are encouraged to do certain things to help us remember:</p>
<p>a. We keep journals.</p>
<p>b. We attend the temple.</p>
<p>c. We offer prayers of gratitude.</p>
<p>d. We study our scriptures.</p>
<p>e. We attend Sunday School, institute, and seminary classes to study the gospel.</p>
<p>f. We partake of the sacrament.</p>
<p>Much of what we do as members of the Church helps form and strengthen our testimonies of the gospel. In addition, remembering spiritual experiences that touched our lives reinforces our faith. Learning of the spiritual strengths and sacrifices of others also helps us. Scriptural accounts, stories of ancestors and faithful pioneers, as well as the testimonies of faithful peers reinforce and strengthen our own testimonies of the gospel.</p>
<p>Today is a day of celebration that will always be a milestone in your lives. Some of you will begin your careers in your chosen field. Others will face board exams, bar exams, internships, or further graduate study. Wherever you are in your lifes journey, this is a day you will remember. I am not confident you will remember any of my words, but while I have your attention, I would like to remind you of a few things.</p>
<p>Remember to be grateful. You have received a wonderful education that is one of the best in higher education, both in its quality and its affordability. Thank your parents, family, and friends who have encouraged you. Many of you have been assisted financially by your loved ones, and all of you have been supported emotionally by them. They deserve your sincere gratitude. Give them a hug and tell them thanks.</p>
<p>In the future remember Brigham Young University and the Church that supports and underwrites it. When you are able, give generously to BYU and support its activities. Stand on the shoulders of those who have donated to make this institution what it is. You may not be able to have a building named after you, but you can support a scholarship fund to help future generations who are privileged to attend this university.</p>
<p>Remember the importance of relationships in your lives. You have made friends in your time here. You probably feel that maintaining these friendships over time will be effortless. You are mistaken. As you now scatter into the world, your lives will become very busy with the demands of your family, your friends, your profession, your community, and your Church service. You will lose track of one another unless you make an effort to stay in touch. Make that effort. You will find it incredibly rewarding. Fortunately, todays social media makes this a bit easier. Cherish these friendships and reach out. As the country song goes, "You cant make old friends" (Caitlyn Smith, Don Schlitz, and Ryan Hanna King, 2013). Keep them.</p>
<p>Remember your family. Your first priority is your immediate family or the family you will one day create. Nothing will bring you more happiness and joy than strong family relationships. Take care of your spouse, love your children, and give them your time. Reach out to extended family and nurture those relationships to help you and your children remember you are indeed part of a larger family unit.</p>
<p>The Snow tribe gathers each Fourth of July in the mountains of southern Utah. It is not a complicated family reunion. It is a one-day affair. We do the very same things each year. The menu even remains the same. For us it is an opportunity to spend time with those who have shaped our lives and made us who we are today. It is also a time for the next generation to make friends with cousins they do not otherwise see often. This time has become so popular with the new generation that some of the younger ones begin asking the afternoon of Christmas Day how long it is before the reunion.</p>
<p>Some of you have begun your own families. My wife, Phyllis, and I know what it is like to be married while in school. For six years we survived on macaroni and cheese, tuna fish, baloney, venison, and bottled peaches. We can recall when any purchase over three dollars demanded consultation. During many of my college years, every time I put on a Sunday suit I noticed baby slobber on the shoulder. Interestingly enough, we now look back on those times with great fondness. Living through them, however, is another thing entirely. Make certain you remember to thank your spouse for helping you be here today. Hopefully he or she has been able to achieve their educational goals as well. If not, there will come a time when you should shoulder some of the burden to make it possible for that to occur.</p>
<p>While this day is a major milestone in your life, trust me, the journey is just beginning. You cannot even imagine the adventures that lie ahead. I would encourage you to record that journey. Some of the most inspiring history comes from the diaries and journals of everyday people like you and me. You need not be a prominent Church leader and copious journal keeper like Wilford Woodruff or George Q. Cannon, but your story is important. Contribute to our body of history by keeping your own story. Your journal might not be highlighted in some future Church history display, but I can assure you it will be treasured by your children and grandchildren for many generations to come.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball said:</p>
<p>I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations. ["Hold Fast to the Iron Rod," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1978]</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that if you dont write your story, it may not get written. Worse still, it might be told by someone else in a way you do not desire. The one who has the last word is the one who writes it down. Remember to keep a journal.</p>
<p>Remember to serve. Your family will keep you very busy, and Church service opportunities will come to you often in the future. Honor these callings and do your very best. Be a good parent, but as your time and circumstances permit, reach out to serve those in your neighborhood, your school district, or your community. I would echo the words of Dr. Albert Schweitzer:</p>
<p><i>I dont know what your destiny will be, . . . but I know one thing: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.</i> ["The Meaning of Ideals in Life," speech given at Silcoates School, Wakefield, England, 3 December 1935; translated from the French in "Visit of Dr. Albert Schweitzer," <i>The Silcoatian,</i> New Series, no. 25 (December 1935): 78485, myhome.spu.edu/sperisho/SchweitzerInTheSilcoatian.pdf; see also liberlocorumcommunium.blogspot.com/2010/10/schweitzer-on-service.html]</p>
<p>Finally, remember the importance of faith in your life. Living gospel principles as best as you are able will immeasurably bless your life and the lives of your family members. Study, pray together as a family, and faithfully attend your worship services. Some days this will seem difficult, and the temptation will be to skip Church just this once. Do not fall into that trap. Be faithful in your Church attendance and serve well in the callings that come your way. Church service is not always convenient, but it will make you a better person, a better member of your family, and a better member of society. Dont let the demands of the world lead to compromises when it comes to your faith. Remember the spiritual experiences that have developed your testimony, live the gospel, teach your family gospel principles, and be a good example to them.</p>
<p>When it comes to faith, remembering is not enough. It is essential that you live so you are entitled to receive new spiritual experiences. Stay strong and stay close to the Spirit so you might be blessed with future spiritual experiences that will strengthen and enrich your faith. So when it comes to your faith, remember what you have learned and felt but also live worthily to renew your faith and testimony.</p>
<p>Remember to enjoy the journey. As President Gordon B. Hinckley once said, "Save your fork. The best is yet to come." I truly believe that, and I wish you a wonderful life as you leave here for the many wonderful adventures that lie ahead. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">One of my favorite religious hymns was written in 1757 by Robert Robinson. The melodic stanzas of the song "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing" bring a certain reflective feeling that prompts me to ponder the love that God has for His children. Each time I hear this hymn I find myself humming the tune throughout the day with the words playing in my mind.
I have always found the first phrase of the second verse to be particularly curious: "Here I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help Ive come" ("Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing," http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Thou_Fount_of_Every_Blessing).
"Here I raise my Ebenezer"? What is the meaning behind this phrase? Certainly it is not a reference to the resurrection of the lead character in Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol - Ebenezer Scrooge. But admittedly that was my only reference to the word.
It is in the Old Testament that we gain further understanding of what it means to "raise my Ebenezer." In 1 Samuel 7 we read that the Israelites were under attack by the Philistines. Outnumbered and in fear for their lives, they pled with the prophet Samuel to pray for Gods help. Samuel offered a sacrifice and prayed for protection. In response the Lord smote the Philistines, and they retreated to their territory. This victory is recorded in verse 12: "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."
In Hebrew the word ebenezer means "stone of help." This raised stone was a reminder to the Israelites of what the Lord had done for them. This Eben-ezer quite literally was a monument set to remember the great help that God granted the one raising the stone. The Old Testament is replete with examples of the children of Israel forgetting the many miracles and spiritual experiences given to them by the Lord.
In an address given to religious educators, President Spencer W. Kimball said that remember could be the most important word in the dictionary (see "Circles of Exaltation," BYU summer school devotional address, 28 June 1968, 8). This is a strong statement that gives us pause to reflect on why a modern-day prophet would make such a deliberate and specific reference to the importance of one word. Today my comments will be centered on this very principle - more specifically, on the importance and value of remembering our own spiritual experiences and recognizing that these experiences, given to us by the Lord, have brought us to where each of us is today. In other words, by remembering we are raising our own Ebenezer.
Raising My Own Ebenezer
One such experience in my life took place nearly thirty years ago when I was a young missionary serving in southern Chile. On a warm summer evening in a small Chilean village filled with humble homes linked by dirt roads, my companion and I were engaged in ro</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I received the call to give a devotional, I accepted the invitation, got off the phone, and knew immediately what - at least some part of what - I would be speaking about today. Then I second-guessed this first impression and considered a whole variety of intellectually provoking things that I might talk about, and I realized that, whatever interesting ideas I might have, they were not the things the Lord was trying to inspire me to speak about.
Maggie, who just offered the prayer, left me a note from some students who had taken a Freshmen Academy class from me a couple of years ago saying that they wished me well in the devotional, thanking me for the class that they had taken, and making reference to a particular story that I had shared with them while I was their teacher. So, I apologize to them because Im going to be sharing that same story today. In reading their note, I was already moved to tears. I said to my husband, "This is not a good sign; Im crying even before Ive started giving the talk."
What I want to talk to you about today is memory, and more specifically, the idea of us remembering the Lord and the Lord remembering us. I have been thinking a great deal lately about memory and remembering. I suppose this is in part because of the gradual deterioration of my own memory as I get older. I sometimes find myself walking from one end of my house to the other (a very short walk, I might add) and finding that I cannot recall why I came to the new location, although I can recall that I had some very specific purpose in mind when I started out.
You students, I have no doubt, think about memory every time you have the prospect of an examination looming over you, hoping and praying that you will be able to remember everything you have studied and perhaps even - with very good luck and divine intervention - some things you did not.
On a more serious note (although I recognize you may not be able to imagine anything more serious than your looming tests), memory has become especially important to me as in recent months I have witnessed the quite rapid and serious loss of the powers of recall in someone I love very much and who, I assumed, would always remember me: my mother. A change that began slowly a few years ago has so accelerated in recent months that during a trip to see my parents just over a month ago, my own mother, upon first seeing me, did not recognize me. For the first two days of my visit, I needed to remind her repeatedly that I am her daughter. She did eventually recall me more regularly, but all the details of my life - that I am married, that I have children, that I live and work in Utah - remained completely unfamiliar to her. It was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my life when my mother looked at me and did not know me.
In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne was the personification of memory. She was the mother of the Nine Muses. The Muses were the goddesses w</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear friends, over the years I have spoken many times to generations of students who have assembled in this great Marriott Center. Today, if you will bear with me, I think I shall change the pattern of those previous addresses. Whether that change will be acceptable or not will depend on you. Furthermore, it is Halloween, and that calls for something a little different, though I dont know why it should.
As all of you recognize, I am now an old man who has weathered many seasons and been touched and affected by many experiences. Emerson was once asked what books he had read that had most influenced his life. He replied that he could no more remember the books he had read than the meals he had eaten, but they had made him.
And so, in the spirit of what Emerson said, rather than giving a speech I have thought to offer several brief cameos or vignettes or seemingly little experiences that I remember from out of the past and that have touched my life in an unforgettable manner. They have all been published, and some of you may be familiar with them. They will not be in chronological order.
I begin with number one.
I was in the city of Torreo, Mexico, and was being driven about in a beautiful and expensive automobile. It belonged to a man named David Casten. At one time he and his wife and their children lived on a little rundown farm. They owned 30 chickens, two pigs, and one skinny horse. They walked in poverty.
Then one day two missionaries called on them. Sister Casten said, "The elders took the blinders from our eyes and brought light into our lives. We knew nothing of Jesus Christ. We knew nothing of God until they came."
They moved into the little town of Bermejillo. Circumstances led them to the junk business. They bought wrecked automobiles. This led to association with insurance companies. They gradually built a prosperous business in which the father and his five sons worked. With simple faith they paid their tithing. They lived the gospel. They served wherever they were called. Four of their sons and three of their daughters filled missions.
Through their influence some 200 of their family and friends have joined the Church. More than 30 sons and daughters of family and friends have served missions. They donated the land on which a chapel now stands. At the time I met them, the children - now grown to maturity - and the parents were taking turns going to Mexico City each month to work in the temple. They are a shining and inspirational example of the miraculous power of missionary work. Think of the wonderful consequences of their being taught and receiving the teachings of the gospel from two humble missionaries. Such miracles are occurring today all across the world.
Now, vignette number two.
I have stood at the tomb of Napoleon in Paris, at the tomb of Lenin in Moscow, and before the burial places of many others of the mighty leaders of the earth. In their tim</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am humbled this morning to share a few words and pray I might say some things that will increase our desire and ability to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for university devotionals. They are a nice break from academic work and let us focus on the weightier matters of the kingdom. I know you students appreciate the chance to get away from writing papers and studying for exams. I have heard how difficult some of those exams can be.
I was told of a zoology professor who is so tough a grader that nobody has ever received an A in his course. Last semester, history was being made because an especially bright student had As on the two midterms. If he could get an A on the final he would have the first A in this professors class - ever. The final test was on birds, and so the student practically memorized the three chapters on birds. He went to the library, checked out extra readings, and felt ready for anything that might appear on the final.
The day of the final the professor said, "Good morning, students. This is your final exam." From underneath the table he pulled out three stuffed birds. Each of them was covered with a little hood, and all you could see were the legs and feet poking out from underneath the hoods. He said, "Now, students, looking at the legs and feet of these three specimens, Id like you to tell me their common names and their scientific names. Thats all you have to do. You have an hour and a half to complete the exam. Begin."
The class sat absolutely stunned. There are thousands of bird species. How do you identify a bird by looking at the legs and feet? This test was given so nobody would get an A. The student who previously thought he had a shot at getting an A wrote down some names he knew were probably incorrect. He went up, slammed his paper on the professors desk, and said, "Sir, thats the dumbest test Ive ever taken in my life. I want to tell you something else. You are the most boring lecturer on this campus."
The professor fumbled for a pen and said, "Just one minute, student. What was your name?"
The student thought for a second, pulled up his pant leg, showed his hairy leg, and said, "Why dont you tell me?"
Sometimes professors need to be put in their places.
Now I know you appreciate this chance to have a break from academics, but Im hoping you wont mind if I pull a short pop quiz to help explore todays subject. Please answer the following questions in your mind.
Question Number 1: What great event turned around the life of Alma the Younger? If you responded that an angel of God came down and called Alma to repentance, I would give you partial credit. Certainly that was part of the equation. But I think the story more importantly illustrates the power of remembering the Savior and thinking of Him than it illustrates the ability of angels to call us to repentance.
Alma rep</span>
