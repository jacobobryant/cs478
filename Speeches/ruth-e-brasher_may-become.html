  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="The trauma and devastation of the wind, mudslides, and floods of recent months have created opportunities for expressions of love, care, and concern throughout our area. It has been said, in fact, that these catastrophes were in part a blessing because of the resulting opportunities to serve. We have witnessed open expressions of brotherhood that often are not evident in the day-to-day unfolding of our lives, and these expressions have crossed boundaries of age, creed, and color. A deep sense of joy and satisfaction has been present as we have shared or observed this outpouring of love. While I was at a national professional meeting a short time ago, individuals from across the country wanted to discuss what they had seen and heard in the media. They frequently spoke of the services rendered to individuals and families as well as for the public good. They talked about the manifestations of genuine love as demonstrated through service and sharing. These experiences have stimulated me to ponder once again why the behaviors so evident in emergencies are less often present in our everyday lives. Why does it take a crisis to bring out our feelings of love and concern for a family member, a friend, a neighbor, or a stranger? Why is an abundance of love so seldom present in our lives? Why, when we have a choice between a fullness of love and something less, do we so frequently choose something less?

As a people, we have all been taught from our youth:

&lt;i&gt;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is the first and great commandment.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. &lt;/i&gt;[Matthew 22:3740]

We know in theory that love is manifest through service - service to our Heavenly Father, to others, and to ourselves - and that we need a balance that helps us keep our perspective. This knowledge, however, does not automatically make love in this sense an integral part of our lives. I would like in the time that is allotted me today to explore with you some thoughts about love - learned from the scriptures and from experiences in living. After a very brief review of the importance of patterning our lives on the principles of love, I will touch on two aspects of love as it relates to our individual lives - first, some benefits of living a life permeated with love and, second, some obstacles that inhibit our capacity to love. As I discuss these two aspects - (1) the benefits that come from living a life of love and (2) the obstacles to our doing so - I would like you to keep in mind a verse I learned as a child. It goes like this:

&lt;i&gt;If white is good&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And black is bad,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Then all my friends&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are gray or plaid.&lt;/i&gt;
It suggests that the benefits and obstacles are not clearly separate, but are perhaps more like opposite sides of the same coin.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love - The Way to Perfection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
To begin - why is it important to pattern our lives on the principle of love? The answer to that question is nowhere more clearly emphasized, it seems to me, than in Matthew 5:4348. We are all familiar with verse 48, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," but have we dwelt on the verses which immediately precede it?

&lt;i&gt;Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&lt;/i&gt;

Love is the basis for becoming perfect or, as the father of one of my special friends said: "The perfection connection is love." We ought therefore to be attentive to its place in our lives. We must be cognizant of the fact that though love comes from God, as Truman Madsen has stated, "Knowing where it comes from is not the same as receiving and giving it. . . . All of us need constant reminders that we cannot have the fruits of love without being in touch with the roots" (Truman G. Madsen, "Joseph Smith and the Sources of Love," in &lt;i&gt;Four Essays on Love&lt;/i&gt; [Provo: Communications Workshop, 1971], p. 9).

There is an integral relationship between loving our Father in Heaven, loving our neighbors, and loving ourselves. Love in these realms gives perspective to all of the laws and the commandments. Thus we cannot afford to just wait for "love" to happen in our lives. We ought to seek it, to refine it, to be sensitive to its presence or absence, to its vitality and strength, because love is essential.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What then are the potential consequences, the benefits, of living a life patterned on the principle of love? In what ways does it make a difference? These questions may require a lifetime, even an eternity, to answer because as our capacity to love increases, we see new horizons - new levels on which we can express love. There are, however, some important consequences that can be experienced and understood now. We do know that we are loved by our Heavenly Father and that great blessings are available if we can reciprocate that love. In 1 Corinthians 2:9 we read, "But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." If we accept and return the love extended to us by God and recognize that it is extended to all mankind - that we are indeed his children - we then have a perspective of who we are and who others are, and that perspective is circumscribed by love.

Knowing our Father loves us and that He created each of us and endowed us with the capacity to fulfill the purposes of life provides us the basis for understanding our worth. Self-esteem and self-confidence flourish in the bonds of love.

I had an experience some five years ago which was deeply moving for me and which in a quiet moment allowed me to see self-esteem, self-confidence, and love all at once. My sister and her family came to spend the night with me. After prayers we all retired. As Nanette, my three-and-a-half-year-old niece, climbed into bed with me, she said, "I didnt kiss my mother and father good night." So she climbed out of bed, went to their bedroom, and kissed them good night. When she returned, she cuddled up to me and said, "Aunt Ruth, Heavenly Father loves me; my mother loves me; my father loves me; you love me; Aunt Carol loves me; my Grandmother Brasher in Duncan, Oklahoma, on a mission loves me; my Grandma Mortensen loves me; my Grandpa Mortensen loves me," and she went on to name Aunt Elaine, Uncle Wallace, cousins Margaret, Jordon, and Yvonne, and then she stopped.

I asked, "But what about Aunt Pat, Uncle Jim, Todd, and Heather?"

Before I could proceed with the list, she interrupted: "Aunt Ruth, I am not telling you everybody in the world that loves me and that I love. I am only telling you the ones that live in Provo; Duncan, Oklahoma; Emery; and Huntington." The specific identification of individuals was significant to me. Love to her was not something abstract, something to generalize about - it was specific. Knowing that she was loved and that she loved others radiated in her self-esteem and her self-confidence.

This love created for Nanette an awareness that she matters and that others matter. She had then and continues to this day to have a sense of peace and a freedom to grow because she is secure. She knows she matters in important ways. When our lives are patterned on the principle of love, we too are secure - secure in an overriding sense even in the face of uncertainty, disappointment, and discouragement about specific aspects of our lives. Thus, we too are free to grow because we understand who we are, and we are in the bonds of love. We know that a loving Father gives us opportunities to struggle because struggle can produce growth and increase our understanding of what love is.

As I contemplated this shared moment with Nanette, I remembered a short incident reported many years ago in the &lt;i&gt;Improvement Era.&lt;/i&gt; It related the comments of a young boy of about four as his mother tucked him into bed. He asked, "Mother, do you love everybody in the world?"

She responded, "Oh, yes, son. It is important that we love everyone. That is what Heavenly Father wants us to do."

His reply was stunning: "I dont. I only love the people in my life."

How often do we profess that we love everyone while our interaction with the important people in our lives demonstrates something far short of love? Sometimes, interaction with family and our friends may not center on love and support at all and may even be destructive. There seems to be an assumption that since our family and friends know us well, they will understand if we dont behave lovingly and will love us anyway. This is a deception. Such behavior has the power to inflict deep hurt. Willard Gaylin, author of&lt;i&gt;Feelings: Our Vital Signs,&lt;/i&gt; stated it succinctly: "We can be touched - and delighted - by an unexpected kindness or courtesy from strangers. When we are hurt, it is invariably by those we love" (Willard Gaylin, "Being Touched, Being Hurt," &lt;i&gt;Psychology Today, &lt;/i&gt;December 1978, p. 117).

Understanding who we are and that we are loved enhances our awareness of the opportunity to strive for perfection, not to achieve it in the foreseeable future but to experience the process - the eternal process. In this context, growth in self-control and self-mastery can become an adventure of stimulating proportions, not just an agony of restraint. Accepting others as well as ourselves as individuals who are in the process of growth permits us to see them in a different light. We can love them as we love ourselves, recognizing that we are all fallible. None of us has been translated. We all need room for error, for falling short, for weakness and inconsistency, for growth as we recognize our shortcomings. We can give ourselves as well as others a break. We can serve, with this understanding, in a spirit of helpfulness as opposed to serving as a matter of duty. There can be warmth and caring even in difficult situations.

Yes, lives patterned on the principle of eternal love establish a perspective for us, who we are and who others are and our relationship to our Heavenly Father - that perspective makes all the difference.

With little effort, some study, and a moment of contemplation, I suspect we could each identify a number of specific differences genuine love can make in our lives. Here is just one example of a specific difference to start us thinking. We read in 1 John 4:18: "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love." Freedom from fear can be an important mobilizing factor in our lives. We note in D&amp;amp;C 60:2 that some "hide the talent . . . given unto them, because of the fear of man," and in Psalms 90:11 that "even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath," and in Proverbs 29:25 that "the fear of man bringeth a snare." Think for a moment. Do you have hidden talents? Have you hesitated to work with them, to develop them, because someone else does it better or because someone may laugh if you try or because someone will know you have a weakness? How often is your anger related to a fear that someone may obtain something you desire or that there is some uncertainty about your place in a situation? When were you last in an untenable position because you were afraid of the consequences of telling the truth and tried to cover your actions? All these responses to fear require time, energy, and emotional input which are nonproductive. Thus, since love eliminates fear, our productive potential is freed to focus on producing rather than on protecting ourselves.

This is one of the places where the gray and plaid sense of categories becomes so evident. While love casting out fear is clearly a positive consequence, we note that fear is an obstacle.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obstacles to Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, back to my central thesis - the perfection connection is love, and its presence in our lives is enriching. Given the importance of this concept and the potential we have to strengthen this quality in our individual lives, lets examine some of the obstacles (in addition to fear) that inhibit our achievement of the fullness of love in our lives.

I will explore these obstacles from two points of view: (1) what we do to ourselves and (2) our responses to others and the resulting consequences for us. What do we do to ourselves that limits our capacity to love? One thing we might do is to close ourselves to ourselves. This closure occurs when our lives become circumscribed by behaviors and attitudes which tend to be so narrowly focused that they never allow us to really discover ourselves. This frame of mind may produce a self-love which is destructive because it creates a smoke screen that prevents us from seeing our wholeness, our potential for growth, our vulnerability, our need for others. Included among these behaviors and attitudes are such things as pride, arrogance, vanity, boastfulness, jealousy, and envy. Each of these is an obstacle. Frequently they are spoken of together in the scriptures. For example, Proverbs 8:13 says, "Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate." And Paul wrote to Timothy:

&lt;i&gt;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Timothy 3:15, 7]

The truth is veiled because we see only in part.

The tenth Psalm also speaks of divers acts of the wicked. Many of the behaviors identified by Paul to Timothy are noted there too. Like the apostle, the psalmist suggests why these behaviors are so serious and why they might blind us to ourselves and to others.

They imply an absence of love. He condemns the wicked for such disregard for others as the persecution of the poor, deceit, and fraud and further states that "God is not in all his thoughts" (verse 4).

When we become so caught up in ourselves that we cannot give heed to our Creator, our fellowmen, or our &lt;i&gt;true selves,&lt;/i&gt; we are not moving toward perfection.

There are many ways in which our words and deeds may project these limiting characteristics. For example, we may emphasize in the academic setting that wisdom which evolves from love and living is not enough and suggest in our arrogance that this wisdom is nothing. We may be so confident of our own capacities that we cannot learn from others, or we choose not to share with others because they have nothing to offer us. We may take advantage of others because of our cleverness - our superior capacity. President John Taylor warned against such behavior. He said,

&lt;i&gt;Because one man is more talented than another, he should not use that talent to take advantage of his brother, and then expect that God will approve of his actions, for he will not do it; he never did, nor ever will. We should operate for one anothers interest, having sympathetic feelings for each other. We are supposed to be brethren in the Church and kingdom of God, knit together by the indissoluble ties of the everlasting Gospel, not for time only, but for eternity. Hence all our operations should be for that end, founded on the principles of righteousness and friendship. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;i&gt;JD &lt;/i&gt;18:284]&amp;gt;

Yes, pride, arrogance, vanity, boastfulness, jealousy, and envy may be irritating to others, but they are likely to be devastating to us because they blind us.

I think of the example of a missionary who made it very clear to everyone in the mission field that he knew more scriptures than anyone else. In fact, he had practically memorized the four standard works. He took every opportunity to be sure that everyone knew that he knew them. The tragedy of the situation was that there seemed to be a lack of understanding, that knowing the words is not sufficient, that we should also understand the meaning and reflect the principles in our lives.

Another set of attitudes that may permeate our lives and inhibit our capacity to love has important impacts on others as well as ourselves. These attitudes are covetousness and greed. In our acquisitive society the desire to get and to have seems almost insatiable at times. We want and we take with no thought of others needs. We often desire more than anyone needs or deserves. We lose an appreciation for living frugally, not because we have to but because it is a good way to live, as William F. Edwards, a financier, economist, and former BYU vice-president, has so often stressed.

A marvelous ad with an important message for all of us recently appeared in the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; placed there by a Nebraska-based energy corporation. It said,

&lt;i&gt;Please dont eat the seed corn.&lt;/i&gt; [Now if you were born in Emery County, as I was, or in the Midwest, you know that seed corn is essential to next years crop. If you eat it now, next years crop is finished.] &lt;i&gt;In our consumption-oriented society the temptation of success is to devour the harvest, to enjoy the fruits of the moment without planning for the future. Thats as dangerous in industry as it is in agriculture.&lt;/i&gt;

I suggest that it is even more dangerous when todays consumption impacts on our potential opportunity for growth now and throughout eternity. It reminds me of the prodigal son. Time, strength, resources, and talents were lost which eternity cannot replace.

Are we part of the group that eats the seed corn? Are we sensitive to the appropriate use of resources? Do we perceive the effects of greed in our lives and its impact on the achievement or development of love in our lives? Many of us have probably never seriously considered these questions. When we read, "And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:24), we are likely to think, "That doesnt apply to me. I am not rich." There are two assumptions embodied in these thoughts: (1) that being rich means having more than I have, and (2) that if I am not rich, I cannot be greedy. I question both the assumptions - richness and capacity for greed.

During the time my parents were serving in the Arizona Holbrook Mission, I joined them for a few days at Christmastime. Christmas morning we delivered treats and greetings to some of the families with whom they worked. As I stood in the center of one of the hogans surveying the surroundings and the people, I was overwhelmed with a sense of my richness in terms of material possessions and awed by the sense of peace, happiness, and contentment that radiated from the faces of the extended-family members who were present. "Could I be this content in these circumstances?" I asked myself. "What did I do to deserve what I have? What are my responsibilities? What are my values? What really matters?"

Am I rich? The answer depends on the comparative basis I choose to use - but in my heart I know that I have enough of this worlds material blessings and that I will be accountable for my use of them. Are you rich? Do you have enough and to spare? How can that determination be made? When we use more than our share of the earths resources, are we rich or are we greedy, or are we both rich and greedy? Are we greedy in our demands? Are we accountable?

Greed can canker our souls, and we lose perspective about who we are and our purpose in life. We may be consuming the seed corn.
&lt;i&gt;Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved! &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 56:16]&amp;gt;
Will we be found among those who lament? Those who have learned too late the importance of giving and of love?

There is further scriptural evidence to suggest that greed and love are not compatible and that the consequences of greed in ones life are far-reaching. For example,

&lt;i&gt;Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant. &lt;/i&gt;[Isaiah 56:1112]

The implication that one cannot understand when ones attention is focused on "never enough" and the "anticipation of more" is frightening.

Thinking of "never enough" reminds me of the young boy who requested more dessert at the conclusion of a Sunday dinner to which his family had several guests. His mother explained that there was no more dessert. This news did not please him, and he responded, "I never get all I want to eat."

His mother in self-defense and embarrassment said, "We always have plenty to eat."

The boy still chafing retorted, "Thereve been lots of times Ive eaten all I could, but never all I wanted."

Are some of us like him? Are we struggling for more - for no more important reason than we just want more? In this frame of mind, what is it that we do not understand? Ezekiel elaborates on this subject in chapter 34. The shepherds fed and clothed themselves; they did not feed the sheep or care for the diseased or the sick. They did not protect the sheep from becoming lost. They did not understand the need for and meaning of love - not that self should not receive attention, but that there should be balance in life, between self and others.

Lest we think that greed applies only to financial and material goods, I hasten to note, as implied in Ezekiel, that it also includes our time, our talents, and our care and concern. These are areas of our lives in which we may also demand more than we deserve and give less than we ought. N. Eldon Tanner, a man who was truly generous in all aspects of his life, said, "The most difficult thing for us seems to be to give of ourselves, to do away with selfishness. If we really love someone, nothing is a hardship" (&lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; April 1967, p. 104). This message is echoed by the inscription on the statue of a boy carrying his brother located at Boys Town, Nebraska: "He aint heavy, Father, hes my brother."

The challenge to give of ourselves may be further increased by a pervading theme of our time - self-fulfillment. The emphasis on self-fulfillment rests on a seldom-articulated base of greed which says that I must pay attention to "me first" and in the process hope that others may be benefited because I am doing what makes me happiest. Daniel Yankelovich, in exploring the ideas about self-fulfillment in "New Rules in American Life: Searching for Self-Fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down," published in &lt;i&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/i&gt; in April 1981, has counseled the self-fulfillment seekers: "The injunction that to find ones self one must lose oneself contains a truth any seeker of selffulfillment needs to grasp" (p. 50). This concept was grasped by both President Tanner and the anonymous boy.

There are those, however, on the other side of the coin who because of inadequate love and appreciation of themselves fail to fill their own wells. They are selfish toward themselves and are thus unable to establish an effective, loving relationship with others. Again we see the need for balance - a love of self and neighbor in a framework of loving our Creator.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love Looks Outward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It becomes evident that a life patterned on the principle of love requires developing an acceptance and love of self and from this base doing a considerable amount of looking outward. On the other hand, achieving a life patterned on the principle of love is hindered by lack of self-acceptance and an undue amount of looking inward - focusing on self. We have the power to decide which way we want to look - to choose to enhance our capacity to love or to choose something less. We can take steps which will enhance the quality of love in our lives. We can refine it. We can choose to help it grow. We can start from where we are and begin an eternal quest to emulate our Father in Heaven in His capacity to love. Mastery of love - the perfection connection - demands love of self and others in the bonds of love of our Heavenly Father.

It is my prayer that, as we grow in our understanding of the centrality of love in our movement toward perfection, we may apply ourselves to incorporating it in our lives and become active participants on the path to perfection.

May we be worthy to receive the blessings Paul promised to the Thessalonians: "And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men" (1 Thessalonians 3:12) - and may I add toward our Heavenly Father and toward ourselves, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>The trauma and devastation of the wind, mudslides, and floods of recent months have created opportunities for expressions of love, care, and concern throughout our area. It has been said, in fact, that these catastrophes were in part a blessing because of the resulting opportunities to serve. We have witnessed open expressions of brotherhood that often are not evident in the day-to-day unfolding of our lives, and these expressions have crossed boundaries of age, creed, and color. A deep sense of joy and satisfaction has been present as we have shared or observed this outpouring of love. While I was at a national professional meeting a short time ago, individuals from across the country wanted to discuss what they had seen and heard in the media. They frequently spoke of the services rendered to individuals and families as well as for the public good. They talked about the manifestations of genuine love as demonstrated through service and sharing. These experiences have stimulated me to ponder once again why the behaviors so evident in emergencies are less often present in our everyday lives. Why does it take a crisis to bring out our feelings of love and concern for a family member, a friend, a neighbor, or a stranger? Why is an abundance of love so seldom present in our lives? Why, when we have a choice between a fullness of love and something less, do we so frequently choose something less?</p>
<p>As a people, we have all been taught from our youth:</p>
<p><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br />
<i>This is the first and great commandment.</i></p>
<p><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i></p>
<p><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. </i>[Matthew 22:3740]</p>
<p>We know in theory that love is manifest through service - service to our Heavenly Father, to others, and to ourselves - and that we need a balance that helps us keep our perspective. This knowledge, however, does not automatically make love in this sense an integral part of our lives. I would like in the time that is allotted me today to explore with you some thoughts about love - learned from the scriptures and from experiences in living. After a very brief review of the importance of patterning our lives on the principles of love, I will touch on two aspects of love as it relates to our individual lives - first, some benefits of living a life permeated with love and, second, some obstacles that inhibit our capacity to love. As I discuss these two aspects - (1) the benefits that come from living a life of love and (2) the obstacles to our doing so - I would like you to keep in mind a verse I learned as a child. It goes like this:</p>
<p><i>If white is good</i><br />
<i>And black is bad,</i><br />
<i>Then all my friends</i><br />
<i>Are gray or plaid.</i><br />
It suggests that the benefits and obstacles are not clearly separate, but are perhaps more like opposite sides of the same coin.</p>
<h2><b>Love - The Way to Perfection</b><b></b></h2>
<p>To begin - why is it important to pattern our lives on the principle of love? The answer to that question is nowhere more clearly emphasized, it seems to me, than in Matthew 5:4348. We are all familiar with verse 48, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," but have we dwelt on the verses which immediately precede it?</p>
<p><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</i><br />
<i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i></p>
<p><i>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</i></p>
<p><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</i></p>
<p><i>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</i></p>
<p><i>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</i></p>
<p>Love is the basis for becoming perfect or, as the father of one of my special friends said: "The perfection connection is love." We ought therefore to be attentive to its place in our lives. We must be cognizant of the fact that though love comes from God, as Truman Madsen has stated, "Knowing where it comes from is not the same as receiving and giving it. . . . All of us need constant reminders that we cannot have the fruits of love without being in touch with the roots" (Truman G. Madsen, "Joseph Smith and the Sources of Love," in <i>Four Essays on Love</i> [Provo: Communications Workshop, 1971], p. 9).</p>
<p>There is an integral relationship between loving our Father in Heaven, loving our neighbors, and loving ourselves. Love in these realms gives perspective to all of the laws and the commandments. Thus we cannot afford to just wait for "love" to happen in our lives. We ought to seek it, to refine it, to be sensitive to its presence or absence, to its vitality and strength, because love is essential.</p>
<h2><b>Benefits of Love</b><b></b></h2>
<p>What then are the potential consequences, the benefits, of living a life patterned on the principle of love? In what ways does it make a difference? These questions may require a lifetime, even an eternity, to answer because as our capacity to love increases, we see new horizons - new levels on which we can express love. There are, however, some important consequences that can be experienced and understood now. We do know that we are loved by our Heavenly Father and that great blessings are available if we can reciprocate that love. In 1 Corinthians 2:9 we read, "But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." If we accept and return the love extended to us by God and recognize that it is extended to all mankind - that we are indeed his children - we then have a perspective of who we are and who others are, and that perspective is circumscribed by love.</p>
<p>Knowing our Father loves us and that He created each of us and endowed us with the capacity to fulfill the purposes of life provides us the basis for understanding our worth. Self-esteem and self-confidence flourish in the bonds of love.</p>
<p>I had an experience some five years ago which was deeply moving for me and which in a quiet moment allowed me to see self-esteem, self-confidence, and love all at once. My sister and her family came to spend the night with me. After prayers we all retired. As Nanette, my three-and-a-half-year-old niece, climbed into bed with me, she said, "I didnt kiss my mother and father good night." So she climbed out of bed, went to their bedroom, and kissed them good night. When she returned, she cuddled up to me and said, "Aunt Ruth, Heavenly Father loves me; my mother loves me; my father loves me; you love me; Aunt Carol loves me; my Grandmother Brasher in Duncan, Oklahoma, on a mission loves me; my Grandma Mortensen loves me; my Grandpa Mortensen loves me," and she went on to name Aunt Elaine, Uncle Wallace, cousins Margaret, Jordon, and Yvonne, and then she stopped.</p>
<p>I asked, "But what about Aunt Pat, Uncle Jim, Todd, and Heather?"</p>
<p>Before I could proceed with the list, she interrupted: "Aunt Ruth, I am not telling you everybody in the world that loves me and that I love. I am only telling you the ones that live in Provo; Duncan, Oklahoma; Emery; and Huntington." The specific identification of individuals was significant to me. Love to her was not something abstract, something to generalize about - it was specific. Knowing that she was loved and that she loved others radiated in her self-esteem and her self-confidence.</p>
<p>This love created for Nanette an awareness that she matters and that others matter. She had then and continues to this day to have a sense of peace and a freedom to grow because she is secure. She knows she matters in important ways. When our lives are patterned on the principle of love, we too are secure - secure in an overriding sense even in the face of uncertainty, disappointment, and discouragement about specific aspects of our lives. Thus, we too are free to grow because we understand who we are, and we are in the bonds of love. We know that a loving Father gives us opportunities to struggle because struggle can produce growth and increase our understanding of what love is.</p>
<p>As I contemplated this shared moment with Nanette, I remembered a short incident reported many years ago in the <i>Improvement Era.</i> It related the comments of a young boy of about four as his mother tucked him into bed. He asked, "Mother, do you love everybody in the world?"</p>
<p>She responded, "Oh, yes, son. It is important that we love everyone. That is what Heavenly Father wants us to do."</p>
<p>His reply was stunning: "I dont. I only love the people in my life."</p>
<p>How often do we profess that we love everyone while our interaction with the important people in our lives demonstrates something far short of love? Sometimes, interaction with family and our friends may not center on love and support at all and may even be destructive. There seems to be an assumption that since our family and friends know us well, they will understand if we dont behave lovingly and will love us anyway. This is a deception. Such behavior has the power to inflict deep hurt. Willard Gaylin, author of<i>Feelings: Our Vital Signs,</i> stated it succinctly: "We can be touched - and delighted - by an unexpected kindness or courtesy from strangers. When we are hurt, it is invariably by those we love" (Willard Gaylin, "Being Touched, Being Hurt," <i>Psychology Today, </i>December 1978, p. 117).</p>
<p>Understanding who we are and that we are loved enhances our awareness of the opportunity to strive for perfection, not to achieve it in the foreseeable future but to experience the process - the eternal process. In this context, growth in self-control and self-mastery can become an adventure of stimulating proportions, not just an agony of restraint. Accepting others as well as ourselves as individuals who are in the process of growth permits us to see them in a different light. We can love them as we love ourselves, recognizing that we are all fallible. None of us has been translated. We all need room for error, for falling short, for weakness and inconsistency, for growth as we recognize our shortcomings. We can give ourselves as well as others a break. We can serve, with this understanding, in a spirit of helpfulness as opposed to serving as a matter of duty. There can be warmth and caring even in difficult situations.</p>
<p>Yes, lives patterned on the principle of eternal love establish a perspective for us, who we are and who others are and our relationship to our Heavenly Father - that perspective makes all the difference.</p>
<p>With little effort, some study, and a moment of contemplation, I suspect we could each identify a number of specific differences genuine love can make in our lives. Here is just one example of a specific difference to start us thinking. We read in 1 John 4:18: "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love." Freedom from fear can be an important mobilizing factor in our lives. We note in D&amp;C 60:2 that some "hide the talent . . . given unto them, because of the fear of man," and in Psalms 90:11 that "even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath," and in Proverbs 29:25 that "the fear of man bringeth a snare." Think for a moment. Do you have hidden talents? Have you hesitated to work with them, to develop them, because someone else does it better or because someone may laugh if you try or because someone will know you have a weakness? How often is your anger related to a fear that someone may obtain something you desire or that there is some uncertainty about your place in a situation? When were you last in an untenable position because you were afraid of the consequences of telling the truth and tried to cover your actions? All these responses to fear require time, energy, and emotional input which are nonproductive. Thus, since love eliminates fear, our productive potential is freed to focus on producing rather than on protecting ourselves.</p>
<p>This is one of the places where the gray and plaid sense of categories becomes so evident. While love casting out fear is clearly a positive consequence, we note that fear is an obstacle.</p>
<h2><b>Obstacles to Love</b><b></b></h2>
<p>Now, back to my central thesis - the perfection connection is love, and its presence in our lives is enriching. Given the importance of this concept and the potential we have to strengthen this quality in our individual lives, lets examine some of the obstacles (in addition to fear) that inhibit our achievement of the fullness of love in our lives.</p>
<p>I will explore these obstacles from two points of view: (1) what we do to ourselves and (2) our responses to others and the resulting consequences for us. What do we do to ourselves that limits our capacity to love? One thing we might do is to close ourselves to ourselves. This closure occurs when our lives become circumscribed by behaviors and attitudes which tend to be so narrowly focused that they never allow us to really discover ourselves. This frame of mind may produce a self-love which is destructive because it creates a smoke screen that prevents us from seeing our wholeness, our potential for growth, our vulnerability, our need for others. Included among these behaviors and attitudes are such things as pride, arrogance, vanity, boastfulness, jealousy, and envy. Each of these is an obstacle. Frequently they are spoken of together in the scriptures. For example, Proverbs 8:13 says, "Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate." And Paul wrote to Timothy:</p>
<p><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i></p>
<p><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i></p>
<p><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i></p>
<p><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i></p>
<p><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </i>[2 Timothy 3:15, 7]</p>
<p>The truth is veiled because we see only in part.</p>
<p>The tenth Psalm also speaks of divers acts of the wicked. Many of the behaviors identified by Paul to Timothy are noted there too. Like the apostle, the psalmist suggests why these behaviors are so serious and why they might blind us to ourselves and to others.</p>
<p>They imply an absence of love. He condemns the wicked for such disregard for others as the persecution of the poor, deceit, and fraud and further states that "God is not in all his thoughts" (verse 4).</p>
<p>When we become so caught up in ourselves that we cannot give heed to our Creator, our fellowmen, or our <i>true selves,</i> we are not moving toward perfection.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which our words and deeds may project these limiting characteristics. For example, we may emphasize in the academic setting that wisdom which evolves from love and living is not enough and suggest in our arrogance that this wisdom is nothing. We may be so confident of our own capacities that we cannot learn from others, or we choose not to share with others because they have nothing to offer us. We may take advantage of others because of our cleverness - our superior capacity. President John Taylor warned against such behavior. He said,</p>
<p><i>Because one man is more talented than another, he should not use that talent to take advantage of his brother, and then expect that God will approve of his actions, for he will not do it; he never did, nor ever will. We should operate for one anothers interest, having sympathetic feelings for each other. We are supposed to be brethren in the Church and kingdom of God, knit together by the indissoluble ties of the everlasting Gospel, not for time only, but for eternity. Hence all our operations should be for that end, founded on the principles of righteousness and friendship. </i>[<i>JD </i>18:284]&gt;</p>
<p>Yes, pride, arrogance, vanity, boastfulness, jealousy, and envy may be irritating to others, but they are likely to be devastating to us because they blind us.</p>
<p>I think of the example of a missionary who made it very clear to everyone in the mission field that he knew more scriptures than anyone else. In fact, he had practically memorized the four standard works. He took every opportunity to be sure that everyone knew that he knew them. The tragedy of the situation was that there seemed to be a lack of understanding, that knowing the words is not sufficient, that we should also understand the meaning and reflect the principles in our lives.</p>
<p>Another set of attitudes that may permeate our lives and inhibit our capacity to love has important impacts on others as well as ourselves. These attitudes are covetousness and greed. In our acquisitive society the desire to get and to have seems almost insatiable at times. We want and we take with no thought of others needs. We often desire more than anyone needs or deserves. We lose an appreciation for living frugally, not because we have to but because it is a good way to live, as William F. Edwards, a financier, economist, and former BYU vice-president, has so often stressed.</p>
<p>A marvelous ad with an important message for all of us recently appeared in the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> placed there by a Nebraska-based energy corporation. It said,</p>
<p><i>Please dont eat the seed corn.</i> [Now if you were born in Emery County, as I was, or in the Midwest, you know that seed corn is essential to next years crop. If you eat it now, next years crop is finished.] <i>In our consumption-oriented society the temptation of success is to devour the harvest, to enjoy the fruits of the moment without planning for the future. Thats as dangerous in industry as it is in agriculture.</i></p>
<p>I suggest that it is even more dangerous when todays consumption impacts on our potential opportunity for growth now and throughout eternity. It reminds me of the prodigal son. Time, strength, resources, and talents were lost which eternity cannot replace.</p>
<p>Are we part of the group that eats the seed corn? Are we sensitive to the appropriate use of resources? Do we perceive the effects of greed in our lives and its impact on the achievement or development of love in our lives? Many of us have probably never seriously considered these questions. When we read, "And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:24), we are likely to think, "That doesnt apply to me. I am not rich." There are two assumptions embodied in these thoughts: (1) that being rich means having more than I have, and (2) that if I am not rich, I cannot be greedy. I question both the assumptions - richness and capacity for greed.</p>
<p>During the time my parents were serving in the Arizona Holbrook Mission, I joined them for a few days at Christmastime. Christmas morning we delivered treats and greetings to some of the families with whom they worked. As I stood in the center of one of the hogans surveying the surroundings and the people, I was overwhelmed with a sense of my richness in terms of material possessions and awed by the sense of peace, happiness, and contentment that radiated from the faces of the extended-family members who were present. "Could I be this content in these circumstances?" I asked myself. "What did I do to deserve what I have? What are my responsibilities? What are my values? What really matters?"</p>
<p>Am I rich? The answer depends on the comparative basis I choose to use - but in my heart I know that I have enough of this worlds material blessings and that I will be accountable for my use of them. Are you rich? Do you have enough and to spare? How can that determination be made? When we use more than our share of the earths resources, are we rich or are we greedy, or are we both rich and greedy? Are we greedy in our demands? Are we accountable?</p>
<p>Greed can canker our souls, and we lose perspective about who we are and our purpose in life. We may be consuming the seed corn.<br />
<i>Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved! </i>[D&amp;C 56:16]&gt;<br />
Will we be found among those who lament? Those who have learned too late the importance of giving and of love?</p>
<p>There is further scriptural evidence to suggest that greed and love are not compatible and that the consequences of greed in ones life are far-reaching. For example,</p>
<p><i>Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</i></p>
<p><i>Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant. </i>[Isaiah 56:1112]</p>
<p>The implication that one cannot understand when ones attention is focused on "never enough" and the "anticipation of more" is frightening.</p>
<p>Thinking of "never enough" reminds me of the young boy who requested more dessert at the conclusion of a Sunday dinner to which his family had several guests. His mother explained that there was no more dessert. This news did not please him, and he responded, "I never get all I want to eat."</p>
<p>His mother in self-defense and embarrassment said, "We always have plenty to eat."</p>
<p>The boy still chafing retorted, "Thereve been lots of times Ive eaten all I could, but never all I wanted."</p>
<p>Are some of us like him? Are we struggling for more - for no more important reason than we just want more? In this frame of mind, what is it that we do not understand? Ezekiel elaborates on this subject in chapter 34. The shepherds fed and clothed themselves; they did not feed the sheep or care for the diseased or the sick. They did not protect the sheep from becoming lost. They did not understand the need for and meaning of love - not that self should not receive attention, but that there should be balance in life, between self and others.</p>
<p>Lest we think that greed applies only to financial and material goods, I hasten to note, as implied in Ezekiel, that it also includes our time, our talents, and our care and concern. These are areas of our lives in which we may also demand more than we deserve and give less than we ought. N. Eldon Tanner, a man who was truly generous in all aspects of his life, said, "The most difficult thing for us seems to be to give of ourselves, to do away with selfishness. If we really love someone, nothing is a hardship" (<i>CR,</i> April 1967, p. 104). This message is echoed by the inscription on the statue of a boy carrying his brother located at Boys Town, Nebraska: "He aint heavy, Father, hes my brother."</p>
<p>The challenge to give of ourselves may be further increased by a pervading theme of our time - self-fulfillment. The emphasis on self-fulfillment rests on a seldom-articulated base of greed which says that I must pay attention to "me first" and in the process hope that others may be benefited because I am doing what makes me happiest. Daniel Yankelovich, in exploring the ideas about self-fulfillment in "New Rules in American Life: Searching for Self-Fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down," published in <i>Psychology Today</i> in April 1981, has counseled the self-fulfillment seekers: "The injunction that to find ones self one must lose oneself contains a truth any seeker of selffulfillment needs to grasp" (p. 50). This concept was grasped by both President Tanner and the anonymous boy.</p>
<p>There are those, however, on the other side of the coin who because of inadequate love and appreciation of themselves fail to fill their own wells. They are selfish toward themselves and are thus unable to establish an effective, loving relationship with others. Again we see the need for balance - a love of self and neighbor in a framework of loving our Creator.</p>
<h2><b>Love Looks Outward</b><b></b></h2>
<p>It becomes evident that a life patterned on the principle of love requires developing an acceptance and love of self and from this base doing a considerable amount of looking outward. On the other hand, achieving a life patterned on the principle of love is hindered by lack of self-acceptance and an undue amount of looking inward - focusing on self. We have the power to decide which way we want to look - to choose to enhance our capacity to love or to choose something less. We can take steps which will enhance the quality of love in our lives. We can refine it. We can choose to help it grow. We can start from where we are and begin an eternal quest to emulate our Father in Heaven in His capacity to love. Mastery of love - the perfection connection - demands love of self and others in the bonds of love of our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>It is my prayer that, as we grow in our understanding of the centrality of love in our movement toward perfection, we may apply ourselves to incorporating it in our lives and become active participants on the path to perfection.</p>
<p>May we be worthy to receive the blessings Paul promised to the Thessalonians: "And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men" (1 Thessalonians 3:12) - and may I add toward our Heavenly Father and toward ourselves, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to begin my remarks today by paying tribute to my parents. It wasnt until I began serving my mission that I realized some parents dont value their children, dont do everything within their power to make their lives better, and dont help their children aspire to be the best they can be. I was one of the fortunate ones, along with my brother and sister, to be born into a family where I was loved, nurtured, and taught by loving parents. They had high expectations for me, but when I failed, they were still there to guide, encourage, and show me how to pick myself up and move forward.
My parents, to the best of my knowledge, had never been very active in the Church. They encouraged us children to attend, but their attendance was infrequent. Yet it was from them that I learned how to live a Christian life. My father, in particular, was the kind of person who could never pass by someone who needed help.
I recall a trip that we made from Salt Lake City to Bear Lake, where a weekend of clear blue water, swimming, water skiing, and fun awaited me. Our typical route was to go to Evanston, Wyoming, and then on to Bear Lake. About twenty miles to the southwest of Evanston, my father noticed a man was trying to flag down cars on the other side of the divided highway. My father could never pass by someone who needed help. He drove five miles up our side of the freeway until he found the first turnaround, drove back five miles, picked up the man who had run out of gas, went five miles in the wrong direction, turned around again, drove the twenty-five miles back to Evanston, helped the man get gas, and drove him back to his car.
 Being an impatient teenager, I was more than irritated at the long delay. After we finally got on our way, I asked my dad why would he go so far out of his way to help someone. Surely someone else would have stopped and given that man assistance.
My dad simply responded, "What goes around comes around." After seeing the confused look on my face, he further explained, "I believe that someday maybe you or I will be on the side of the road looking for help, and someone will return the favor."
Being ever the optimist, I replied, "I seriously doubt it."
So today I would like to title my talk "Living a Life of Service and Love: What Goes Around Comes Around."
Weve heard this saying before in many different forms. The Boy Scout slogan: Do a good turn daily. Pay it back. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, which is the golden rule. You reap what you sow.
These are all well and good, but my dad lived by the mantra "What goes around comes around." He would help anyone anytime and anywhere.
But on the other hand, how many times have we heard or said that no good deed goes unpunishe</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It may not surprise you, but I want to declare at the outset that I have been multiply blessed. I want to initially mention an important blessing - this university - and then I would like to dwell on a forty-one-year blessing - my marriage. Those who have received this award in past years have stood here to express their gratitude to BYU, but I feel especially blessed in receiving this award as a non-Mormon. This university has insisted on valuing me regardless of my religious minority status. I am a religious "other," yet this university has not only accepted me as a colleague and a friend but also persisted in recognizing me and celebrating my work. I think this is a sort of minor miracle. As you will see in the case of my wife, I honestly believe that when we truly value and even love those who are "other" in some way, God is there.1
I also want to acknowledge how important this university has been to my academic work. I have long desired to actively interface the sacred and the secular - the sacredness of my faith and the secularity of my discipline of psychology - but there are few places that permit this work. BYU, however, has not only welcomed this type of scholarship but also encouraged and facilitated it. For this reason, I have never had to compartmentalize my Christianity away from my discipline; I have been able to integrate the two - which has been an incredible blessing to me!
As I mentioned, however, the blessing I want to dwell on today is the love I feel for my wife. But discussing such a personal experience may seem a bit strange for a psychologist. Psychologists are supposed to deal with objective data.2 Unfortunately, love isnt objective, so psychologys knowledge of love has been meager over the years. Consider renowned love researcher Harry Harlow and his lament in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association:
So far as love or affection is concerned, psychologists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple observation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.3
This conclusion was stated many years ago, but it is not unusual for even modern investigators of love to echo Harlows lament. Zick Rubin, for example, believes that some progress has been made, but he comments that love has "seemed safely beyond the research scientists ever-extending grasp."4
I wont get into psychological methods here. Suffice it to say that a relatively new brand of psychological method - qualitative investigation - was specifically set up to study subjective experiences. And qualitative investigators are not afraid of even just one persons experiences, especially when those personal experiences teach us something about the phenomenon of interest.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">How many of you recall seeing the great arch of the Milky Way span the sky over your head, along with millions of other stars that cover the dome of the heavens?
Because I live in a city, one of the things that I forget is the glory of that night sky stretching from one horizon to the other. Prior to the industrialization of society, a view of the night sky filled with stars would have been common. It is breathtaking to realize that the stars seen from Earth are only a few of the stars in our Milky Way Galaxy, which is estimated to contain on the order of 300 billion stars.
Sometime back our friends who have a cabin in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado invited us to a star party in which a group gathered with telescopes far from city lights to view interesting features such as planets in our own solar system and nebulae in our galaxy, as well as the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbor. The telescopes ranged in size from small refracting telescopes on tripods to large reflecting telescopes that required a ladder to get to the eyepiece. As powerful as these amateur telescopes were, astronomy research requires much more powerful instruments.
One of those powerful instruments is the Hubble Space Telescope, built in 1990. It orbits about 350 miles above the earth, far above the interference of the atmosphere. Hubbles mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter, and the entire telescope weighs more than ten tons. Since its launch it has made more than one million observations, resulting in more than 100 terabytes of data. Astronomers from all over the world use the Hubble in their research. Many of you have likely seen images from the Hubble.
Even amateur telescopes can capture a detailed view of Saturn, but the Hubble Telescope is able to catch colorful views of Saturn in wavelengths not visible to the human eye. Saturn is, in my view, the most beautiful planet in our solar system, and it lies only about 1.1 light-hours from Earth at its nearest approach.
Although viewing the planets of our own solar system has yielded spectacular results, the Hubble isnt limited to close-range objects.
Looking beyond our solar system, the Hubble Telescope has captured images of the Ring Nebula, located about 2,000 light-years from Earth, that shows the varying colors of each ring of debris from the supernova that created the nebula thousands of years ago. C. Robert ODell noted that
the nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, its like a jelly doughnut, because its filled with material in the middle. . . . With Hubbles detail, we see a completely different shape than whats been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">After receiving the call from President Worthen asking me to speak at devotional today, I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about what I might say.
One evening my daughter Andrea, who is a recent graduate of BYU, said, "Dad, dont worry. I always went to devotional to feel the Spirit and to have a rest from the stress of a week of school. As long as you bring the Spirit, it will be okay."
My prayer since then has been for the Spirit to attend us here today and to teach us all something new.
I would like to start with a favorite scripture. In 1 Nephi the young Nephi desired to see the same things that his father, Lehi, saw in a vision. An angel came and showed him what Lehi saw - and even more - and asked him, "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" (1 Nephi 11:16).
Nephi replied, "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17).
I remember reading the Book of Mormon as a boy and coming to these verses and thinking, "I dont even know what that word - condescension - means! But wow, I love Nephis answer! He knew that his Heavenly Father loved him, and that was what mattered most to him."
I have spent years pondering this declaration of Nephis. It tells me who I am: I am a child of a loving Father in Heaven. Many in the world today deny the divinity of man. They claim that we are merely the victors in a biological race for superiority of the species on this planet. But I testify that, through holy prophets, God has revealed that as we are His children, there is a purpose to our lives. We should all rejoice in this knowledge that we have. But we should realize that not all people have it.
After arriving in the mission field many years ago, one of the first things I learned was that most of the people in Taiwan with whom I came into contact had no concept of God as their Father in Heaven. I realized that I, however, had always just taken that knowledge for granted. Back then the discussions were memorized and were designated by letters of the alphabet. My favorite discussion quickly became the D discussion, the plan of salvation. I loved it mainly because it allowed us to teach this most fundamental truth - that of our relationship to a loving Heavenly Father. I saw this truth change the lives of the Taiwan Saints. Once they learned it, they were changed people; they radiated a love for their Heavenly Father.
In contrast, a few years ago we had a graduate student in our department who exhibited the opposite. Having been raised in a communist and atheistic country, he had no knowledge of what we are talking about here today. At one point in his studies he had a series of setbacks. From these he concluded that "fate" had turned against him. He felt powerless and not in control of his own destiny. He concluded he was not meant to complete his degree and decided to leave our graduate progra</span>
