  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="You all look so good. Sister Holland walked in and said, "I think Im going to cry." You have to understand: Give yourselves 20 or 30 years - then youll know how we feel coming back here.

We love this campus. Were thrilled to be with you on it, and we love you personally with all our hearts.

You have had, will have, and now have better university presidents than I was, but youll never have one who loves you and loves this university more than I do. Thank you for serving here, and thank you for being in attendance on a bright, clear, January morning.

We are grateful to President and Sister Samuelson for their kindness and their leadership at this university. We actually know something about their jobs and what they entail. You and we are very lucky to have them at the helm of this special school, and we praise them publicly for the time they spend, the success they are having, and the strength that they bring. I loved every word of their counsel to you last week, and I pray that my remarks to you today are consistent with their messages about light, about trust, and about the privilege it is to have the gospel of Jesus Christ enhance our study at BYU. President and Sister Samuelson, we do love you. You have our prayers, our gratitude, and our support.

The start of a new year is the traditional time to take stock of our lives and see where we are going, measured against the backdrop of where we have been. I dont want to talk to you about New Years resolutions, because you only made five of them and you have already broken four. (I give that remaining one just another week.) But I do want to talk to you about the past and the future, not so much in terms of New Years commitments per se, but more with an eye toward &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; time of transition and change in your lives - and those moments come virtually every day of our lives.

As a scriptural theme for this discussion, I have chosen the second-shortest verse in all of holy scripture. I am told that the shortest verse - a verse that every missionary memorizes and holds ready in case he is called on spontaneously in a zone conference - is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.35?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John 11:35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: "Jesus wept." Elders, here is a second option, another shortie that will dazzle your mission president in case you are called on two zone conferences in a row. It is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.32?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Luke 17:32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where the Savior cautions, "Remember Lots wife."

Hmmm. What did He mean by such an enigmatic little phrase? To find out, I suppose we need to do as He suggested. Lets recall who Lots wife was.

The original story, of course, comes to us out of the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when the Lord, having had as much as He could stand of the worst that men and women could do, told Lot and his family to flee because those cities were about to be destroyed. "Escape for thy life," the Lord said, "&lt;i&gt;look not behind thee&lt;/i&gt; . . . ; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.17?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Genesis 19:17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; emphasis added).

With less than immediate obedience and more than a little negotiation, Lot and his family ultimately did leave town, but just in the nick of time. The scriptures tell us what happened at daybreak the morning following their escape:

&lt;i&gt;The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he overthrew those cities.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.24-25?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Genesis 19:2425&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]

Then our theme today comes in the next verse. Surely, surely, with the Lords counsel "look not behind thee" ringing clearly in her ears, Lots wife, the record says, "looked back," and she was turned into a pillar of salt.

In the time we have this morning, I am not going to talk to you about the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, nor of the comparison the Lord Himself has made to those days and our own time. I am not even going to talk about obedience and disobedience. I just want to talk to you for a few minutes about looking back and looking ahead.

One of the purposes of history is to teach us the lessons of life. George Santayana, who should be more widely read than he is on a college campus, is best known for saying, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" (&lt;i&gt;Reason in Common Sense,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 1 of &lt;i&gt;The Life of Reason&lt;/i&gt; [19051906]).

So, if history is this important - and it surely is - what did Lots wife do that was so wrong? As something of a student of history, I have thought about that and offer this as a partial answer. Apparently what was wrong with Lots wife was that she wasnt just &lt;i&gt;looking&lt;/i&gt; back; in her heart she wanted to &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt; back. It would appear that even before they were past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. As Elder Maxwell once said, such people know they should have their primary residence in Zion, but they still hope to keep a summer cottage in Babylon (see Larry W. Gibbons, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/wherefore-settle-this-in-your-hearts?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;"Wherefore, Settle This in Your Hearts,"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2006, 102; also Neal A. Maxwell, &lt;i&gt;A Wonderful Flood of Light&lt;/i&gt; [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1990], 47).

It is possible that Lots wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. We certainly know that Laman and Lemuel were resentful when Lehi and his family were commanded to leave Jerusalem. So it isnt just that she looked back; she looked back &lt;i&gt;longingly.&lt;/i&gt; In short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.

So, as a new year starts and we try to benefit from a proper view of what has gone before, I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone, nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead, we remember that &lt;i&gt;faith is always pointed toward the future.&lt;/i&gt; Faith always has to do with blessings and truths and events that will &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; be efficacious in our lives. So a more theological way to talk about Lots wife is to say that she did not have faith. She doubted the Lords ability to give her something better than she already had. Apparently she thought - fatally, as it turned out - that nothing that lay ahead could possibly be as good as those moments she was leaving behind.

It is here at this moment in this little story that we wish Lots wife had been a student at BYU enrolled in a freshman English class. With any luck, she might have read, as I did, this verse from Edwin Arlington Robinson:

&lt;i&gt;Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Grew lean while he assailed the seasons;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He wept that he was ever born,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he had reasons.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Miniver loved the days of old&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When swords were bright and steeds were prancing;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The vision of a warrior bold&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Would set him dancing.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Miniver sighed for what was not,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And dreamed, and rested from his labors;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Priams neighbors. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Miniver cursed the commonplace&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And eyed a khaki suit with loathing;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He missed the medieval grace&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of iron clothing. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Miniver Cheevy, born too late,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Scratched his head and kept on thinking;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Miniver coughed, and called it fate,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And kept on drinking.&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;Miniver Cheevy&lt;/i&gt; (1910), stanzas 13, 6, 8]

To yearn to go back to a world that cannot be lived in now; to be perennially dissatisfied with present circumstances and have only dismal views of the future; to miss the here-and-now-and-tomorrow because we are so trapped in the there-and-then-and-yesterday - these are some of the sins, if we may call them that, of both Lots wife and old Mr. Cheevy. (Now, as a passing comment, I dont know whether Lots wife, like Miniver, was a drinker, but if she was, she certainly ended up with plenty of salt for her pretzels.)

One of my favorite books of the New Testament is Pauls too-seldom-read letter to the Philippians. After reviewing the very privileged and rewarding life of his early years - his birthright, his education, his standing in the Jewish community - Paul says that all of that was nothing ("dung" he calls it) compared to his conversion to Christianity. He says, and I paraphrase: "I have stopped rhapsodizing about the good old days and now eagerly look toward the future that I may apprehend that for which Christ apprehended me." Then comes this verse:

&lt;i&gt;This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/3.13-14?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philippians 3:1314&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]

No Lots wife here. No looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah here. Paul knows it is out there in the future, up ahead wherever heaven is taking us where we will win "the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."

At this point, let me pause and add a lesson that applies both in your own life and also in the lives of others. There is something in us, at least in too many of us, that particularly fails to forgive and forget earlier mistakes in life - either mistakes we ourselves have made or the mistakes of others. That is not good. It is not Christian. It stands in terrible opposition to the grandeur and majesty of the Atonement of Christ. To be tied to earlier mistakes - our own or other peoples - is the worst kind of wallowing in the past from which we are called to cease and desist.

I was told once of a young man who for many years was more or less the brunt of every joke in his school. He had some disadvantages, and it was easy for his peers to tease him. Later in his life he moved away from his community. He eventually joined the army and had some successful experiences there in getting an education and generally stepping away from his past. Above all, as many in the military do, he discovered the beauty and majesty of the Church and became very active and happy in it.

Then, after several years, he came back to the town of his youth. Most of his generation had moved on, but not all. Apparently when he returned quite successful and quite reborn, the same old mind-set that had existed before was still there, waiting for his return. To the people in his hometown he was still just old "so and so" - you remember the guy who had the problem, that idiosyncrasy, this quirky nature, and did such and such and such and such. And wasnt it all just hilarious?

Well, you know what happened. Little by little this mans Pauline effort to leave that which was behind and grasp the prize that God had laid before him was gradually diminished until he died about the way he had lived in his youth. He came full circle: again inactive and unhappy and the brunt of a new generation of jokes. Yet he had had that one bright, beautiful midlife moment when he had been able to rise above his past and truly see who he was and what he could become. Too bad, too sad, that he was again to be surrounded by a whole batch of Lots wives, those who thought his past was more interesting than his future. Yes, they managed to rip out of his grasp that for which Christ had grasped him. And he died even more sadly than Miniver Cheevy, though as far as I know the story, through absolutely no fault of his own.

That happens in marriages, too, and in other relationships we have. I cant tell you the number of couples I have counseled who, when they are deeply hurt or even just deeply stressed, reach farther and farther into the past to find yet a bigger brick to throw through the window "pain" of their marriage. When something is over and done with, when it has been repented of as fully as it can be repented of, when life has moved on as it should and a lot of other wonderfully good things have happened since then, it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; right to go back and open up some ancient wound that the Son of God Himself died trying to heal.

&lt;i&gt;Let people repent. Let people grow. Believe that people can change and improve.&lt;/i&gt; Is that faith? Yes! Is that hope? Yes! Is it charity? Yes! Above all, it is charity, the pure love of Christ. If something is buried in the past, leave it buried. Dont keep going back with your little sand pail and beach shovel to dig it up, wave it around, and then throw it at someone, saying, "Hey! Do you remember &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt;" Splat!

Well, guess what? That is probably going to result in some ugly morsel being dug up out of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; landfill with the reply, "Yeah, I remember it. Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; remember &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt;" Splat.

And soon enough everyone comes out of that exchange dirty and muddy and unhappy and hurt, when what God, our Father in Heaven, pleads for is cleanliness and kindness and happiness and healing.

Such dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is worse than Miniver Cheevy, and in some ways worse than Lots wife, because at least there he and she were only destroying themselves. In these cases of marriage and family and wards and apartments and neighborhoods, we can end up destroying so many, many others.

Perhaps at this beginning of a new year there is no greater requirement for us than to do as the Lord Himself said He does: "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 58:42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

The proviso, of course, is that repentance has to be sincere, but when it is and when honest effort is being made to progress, we are guilty of the greater sin if we keep remembering and recalling and rebashing someone with their earlier mistakes - and that "someone" might be ourselves. We can be so hard on ourselves, often much more so than with others!

Now, like the Anti-Nephi-Lehies of the Book of Mormon, bury your weapons of war, and leave them buried. Forgive, and do that which is harder than to forgive: Forget. And when it comes to mind again, forget it again.

You can remember just enough to avoid repeating the mistake, but then put the rest of it all on the dung heap Paul spoke of to those Philippians. Dismiss the destructive and keep dismissing it until the beauty of the Atonement of Christ has revealed to you your bright future and the bright future of your family and your friends and your neighbors. God doesnt care nearly as much about where you have been as He does about where you are and, with His help, where you are willing to go. That is the thing Lots wife didnt get - and neither did Laman and Lemuel and a host of others in the scriptures.

This is an important matter to consider at the start of a new year - and every day ought to be the start of a new year and a new life. Such is the wonder of faith and repentance and the miracle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

We started this hour with a little verse remembered from one of my BYU English classes. May I move toward a close with a few lines from another favorite poet whom I probably met in that same class or one similar to it. For the benefit of all BYU students in the new year of 2009, Robert Browning wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Grow old along with me!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The best is yet to be,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The last of life, for which the first was made:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Our times are in His hand&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who saith, "A whole I planned,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!"&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;Rabbi Ben Ezra&lt;/i&gt; (1864), stanza 1]

Sister Holland and I were married about the time both of us were reading poems like that in BYU classrooms. We were as starstruck - and as fearful - as most of you are at these ages and stages of life. We had absolutely no money. Zero. For a variety of reasons, neither of our families was able to help finance our education. We had a small apartment just south of campus - the smallest we could find: two rooms and a half bath. We were both working too many hours trying to stay afloat financially, but we had no other choice.

I remember one fall day - I think it was in the first semester after our marriage in 1963 - we were walking together up the hill past the Maeser Building on the sidewalk that led between the Presidents Home and the Brimhall Building. Somewhere on that path we stopped and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. Life that day seemed so overwhelming, and the undergraduate plus graduate years that we still anticipated before us seemed monumental, nearly insurmountable. Our love for each other and our commitment to the gospel were strong, but most of all the other temporal things around us seemed particularly ominous.

On a spot that I could probably still mark for you today, I turned to Pat and said something like this: "Honey, should we give up? I can get a good job and carve out a good living for us. I can do some things. Ill be okay without a degree. Should we stop trying to tackle what right now seems so difficult to face?"

In my best reenactment of Lots wife, I said, in effect, "Lets go back. Lets go home. The future holds nothing for us."

Then my beloved little bride did what she has done for 45 years since then. She grabbed me by the lapels and said, "We are not going back. We are not going home. The future holds &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; for us."

She stood there in the sunlight that day and gave me a real talk. I dont recall that she quoted Paul, but there was certainly plenty in her voice that said she was committed to setting aside all that was past in order to "press toward the mark" and seize the prize of God that lay yet ahead. It was a living demonstration of faith. It was "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hebrews 11:1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). So we laughed, kept walking, and finished up sharing a root beer - one glass, two straws - at the then newly constructed Wilkinson Center.

Twenty years later I would, on occasion, look out of the window of the Presidents Home across the street from the Brimhall Building and picture there on the sidewalk two newlywed BYU students, down on their money and down even more on their confidence. And as I would gaze out that window, usually at night, I would occasionally see not Pat and Jeff Holland but you and you and you, walking that same sidewalk. I would see you sometimes as couples, sometimes as a group of friends, sometimes as just a lone student. I knew something of what you were feeling. Some of you were having thoughts such as these: Is there any future for me? What does a new year or a new semester or a new major or a new romance hold for me? Will I be safe? Will life be sound? Can I trust in the Lord and in the future? Or would it be better to look back, to go back, to go home?

To all such of every generation, I call out, "Remember Lots wife." Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that Christ truly is the "high priest of good things to come."

My young brothers and sisters, I pray you will have a wonderful semester, a wonderful new year, and a wonderful life all filled with faith and hope and charity. Keep your eyes on your dreams, however distant and far away. Live to see the miracles of repentance and forgiveness, of trust and divine love that will transform your life today, tomorrow, and forever. That is a New Years resolution I ask you to keep, and I leave a blessing on you - every one of you - to be able to do so and to be happy, in the name of Him who makes it all possible, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>You all look so good. Sister Holland walked in and said, "I think Im going to cry." You have to understand: Give yourselves 20 or 30 years - then youll know how we feel coming back here.</p>
<p>We love this campus. Were thrilled to be with you on it, and we love you personally with all our hearts.</p>
<p>You have had, will have, and now have better university presidents than I was, but youll never have one who loves you and loves this university more than I do. Thank you for serving here, and thank you for being in attendance on a bright, clear, January morning.</p>
<p>We are grateful to President and Sister Samuelson for their kindness and their leadership at this university. We actually know something about their jobs and what they entail. You and we are very lucky to have them at the helm of this special school, and we praise them publicly for the time they spend, the success they are having, and the strength that they bring. I loved every word of their counsel to you last week, and I pray that my remarks to you today are consistent with their messages about light, about trust, and about the privilege it is to have the gospel of Jesus Christ enhance our study at BYU. President and Sister Samuelson, we do love you. You have our prayers, our gratitude, and our support.</p>
<p>The start of a new year is the traditional time to take stock of our lives and see where we are going, measured against the backdrop of where we have been. I dont want to talk to you about New Years resolutions, because you only made five of them and you have already broken four. (I give that remaining one just another week.) But I do want to talk to you about the past and the future, not so much in terms of New Years commitments per se, but more with an eye toward <i>any</i> time of transition and change in your lives - and those moments come virtually every day of our lives.</p>
<p>As a scriptural theme for this discussion, I have chosen the second-shortest verse in all of holy scripture. I am told that the shortest verse - a verse that every missionary memorizes and holds ready in case he is called on spontaneously in a zone conference - is <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.35?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 11:35</a></span>: "Jesus wept." Elders, here is a second option, another shortie that will dazzle your mission president in case you are called on two zone conferences in a row. It is <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.32?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 17:32</a></span>, where the Savior cautions, "Remember Lots wife."</p>
<p>Hmmm. What did He mean by such an enigmatic little phrase? To find out, I suppose we need to do as He suggested. Lets recall who Lots wife was.</p>
<p>The original story, of course, comes to us out of the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when the Lord, having had as much as He could stand of the worst that men and women could do, told Lot and his family to flee because those cities were about to be destroyed. "Escape for thy life," the Lord said, "<i>look not behind thee</i> . . . ; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.17?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis 19:17</a></span>; emphasis added).</p>
<p>With less than immediate obedience and more than a little negotiation, Lot and his family ultimately did leave town, but just in the nick of time. The scriptures tell us what happened at daybreak the morning following their escape:</p>
<p><i>The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;</i></p>
<p><i>And he overthrew those cities.</i> [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.24-25?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis 19:2425</a></span>]</p>
<p>Then our theme today comes in the next verse. Surely, surely, with the Lords counsel "look not behind thee" ringing clearly in her ears, Lots wife, the record says, "looked back," and she was turned into a pillar of salt.</p>
<p>In the time we have this morning, I am not going to talk to you about the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, nor of the comparison the Lord Himself has made to those days and our own time. I am not even going to talk about obedience and disobedience. I just want to talk to you for a few minutes about looking back and looking ahead.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of history is to teach us the lessons of life. George Santayana, who should be more widely read than he is on a college campus, is best known for saying, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" (<i>Reason in Common Sense,</i> vol. 1 of <i>The Life of Reason</i> [19051906]).</p>
<p>So, if history is this important - and it surely is - what did Lots wife do that was so wrong? As something of a student of history, I have thought about that and offer this as a partial answer. Apparently what was wrong with Lots wife was that she wasnt just <i>looking</i> back; in her heart she wanted to <i>go</i> back. It would appear that even before they were past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. As Elder Maxwell once said, such people know they should have their primary residence in Zion, but they still hope to keep a summer cottage in Babylon (see Larry W. Gibbons, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/wherefore-settle-this-in-your-hearts?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Wherefore, Settle This in Your Hearts,"</a></span> <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 102; also Neal A. Maxwell, <i>A Wonderful Flood of Light</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1990], 47).</p>
<p>It is possible that Lots wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. We certainly know that Laman and Lemuel were resentful when Lehi and his family were commanded to leave Jerusalem. So it isnt just that she looked back; she looked back <i>longingly.</i> In short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.</p>
<p>So, as a new year starts and we try to benefit from a proper view of what has gone before, I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone, nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead, we remember that <i>faith is always pointed toward the future.</i> Faith always has to do with blessings and truths and events that will <i>yet</i> be efficacious in our lives. So a more theological way to talk about Lots wife is to say that she did not have faith. She doubted the Lords ability to give her something better than she already had. Apparently she thought - fatally, as it turned out - that nothing that lay ahead could possibly be as good as those moments she was leaving behind.</p>
<p>It is here at this moment in this little story that we wish Lots wife had been a student at BYU enrolled in a freshman English class. With any luck, she might have read, as I did, this verse from Edwin Arlington Robinson:</p>
<p><i>Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,</i></p>
<p><i>Grew lean while he assailed the seasons;</i></p>
<p><i>He wept that he was ever born,</i></p>
<p><i>And he had reasons.</i></p>
<p><i>Miniver loved the days of old</i></p>
<p><i>When swords were bright and steeds were prancing;</i></p>
<p><i>The vision of a warrior bold</i></p>
<p><i>Would set him dancing.</i></p>
<p><i>Miniver sighed for what was not,</i></p>
<p><i>And dreamed, and rested from his labors;</i></p>
<p><i>He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot,</i></p>
<p><i>And Priams neighbors. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Miniver cursed the commonplace</i></p>
<p><i>And eyed a khaki suit with loathing;</i></p>
<p><i>He missed the medieval grace</i></p>
<p><i>Of iron clothing. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Miniver Cheevy, born too late,</i></p>
<p><i>Scratched his head and kept on thinking;</i></p>
<p><i>Miniver coughed, and called it fate,</i></p>
<p><i>And kept on drinking.</i></p>
<p>[<i>Miniver Cheevy</i> (1910), stanzas 13, 6, 8]</p>
<p>To yearn to go back to a world that cannot be lived in now; to be perennially dissatisfied with present circumstances and have only dismal views of the future; to miss the here-and-now-and-tomorrow because we are so trapped in the there-and-then-and-yesterday - these are some of the sins, if we may call them that, of both Lots wife and old Mr. Cheevy. (Now, as a passing comment, I dont know whether Lots wife, like Miniver, was a drinker, but if she was, she certainly ended up with plenty of salt for her pretzels.)</p>
<p>One of my favorite books of the New Testament is Pauls too-seldom-read letter to the Philippians. After reviewing the very privileged and rewarding life of his early years - his birthright, his education, his standing in the Jewish community - Paul says that all of that was nothing ("dung" he calls it) compared to his conversion to Christianity. He says, and I paraphrase: "I have stopped rhapsodizing about the good old days and now eagerly look toward the future that I may apprehend that for which Christ apprehended me." Then comes this verse:</p>
<p><i>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</i></p>
<p><i>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</i> [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/3.13-14?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippians 3:1314</a></span>]</p>
<p>No Lots wife here. No looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah here. Paul knows it is out there in the future, up ahead wherever heaven is taking us where we will win "the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p>At this point, let me pause and add a lesson that applies both in your own life and also in the lives of others. There is something in us, at least in too many of us, that particularly fails to forgive and forget earlier mistakes in life - either mistakes we ourselves have made or the mistakes of others. That is not good. It is not Christian. It stands in terrible opposition to the grandeur and majesty of the Atonement of Christ. To be tied to earlier mistakes - our own or other peoples - is the worst kind of wallowing in the past from which we are called to cease and desist.</p>
<p>I was told once of a young man who for many years was more or less the brunt of every joke in his school. He had some disadvantages, and it was easy for his peers to tease him. Later in his life he moved away from his community. He eventually joined the army and had some successful experiences there in getting an education and generally stepping away from his past. Above all, as many in the military do, he discovered the beauty and majesty of the Church and became very active and happy in it.</p>
<p>Then, after several years, he came back to the town of his youth. Most of his generation had moved on, but not all. Apparently when he returned quite successful and quite reborn, the same old mind-set that had existed before was still there, waiting for his return. To the people in his hometown he was still just old "so and so" - you remember the guy who had the problem, that idiosyncrasy, this quirky nature, and did such and such and such and such. And wasnt it all just hilarious?</p>
<p>Well, you know what happened. Little by little this mans Pauline effort to leave that which was behind and grasp the prize that God had laid before him was gradually diminished until he died about the way he had lived in his youth. He came full circle: again inactive and unhappy and the brunt of a new generation of jokes. Yet he had had that one bright, beautiful midlife moment when he had been able to rise above his past and truly see who he was and what he could become. Too bad, too sad, that he was again to be surrounded by a whole batch of Lots wives, those who thought his past was more interesting than his future. Yes, they managed to rip out of his grasp that for which Christ had grasped him. And he died even more sadly than Miniver Cheevy, though as far as I know the story, through absolutely no fault of his own.</p>
<p>That happens in marriages, too, and in other relationships we have. I cant tell you the number of couples I have counseled who, when they are deeply hurt or even just deeply stressed, reach farther and farther into the past to find yet a bigger brick to throw through the window "pain" of their marriage. When something is over and done with, when it has been repented of as fully as it can be repented of, when life has moved on as it should and a lot of other wonderfully good things have happened since then, it is <i>not</i> right to go back and open up some ancient wound that the Son of God Himself died trying to heal.</p>
<p><i>Let people repent. Let people grow. Believe that people can change and improve.</i> Is that faith? Yes! Is that hope? Yes! Is it charity? Yes! Above all, it is charity, the pure love of Christ. If something is buried in the past, leave it buried. Dont keep going back with your little sand pail and beach shovel to dig it up, wave it around, and then throw it at someone, saying, "Hey! Do you remember <i>this?</i>" Splat!</p>
<p>Well, guess what? That is probably going to result in some ugly morsel being dug up out of <i>your</i> landfill with the reply, "Yeah, I remember it. Do <i>you</i> remember <i>this?</i>" Splat.</p>
<p>And soon enough everyone comes out of that exchange dirty and muddy and unhappy and hurt, when what God, our Father in Heaven, pleads for is cleanliness and kindness and happiness and healing.</p>
<p>Such dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is worse than Miniver Cheevy, and in some ways worse than Lots wife, because at least there he and she were only destroying themselves. In these cases of marriage and family and wards and apartments and neighborhoods, we can end up destroying so many, many others.</p>
<p>Perhaps at this beginning of a new year there is no greater requirement for us than to do as the Lord Himself said He does: "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;C 58:42</a></span>).</p>
<p>The proviso, of course, is that repentance has to be sincere, but when it is and when honest effort is being made to progress, we are guilty of the greater sin if we keep remembering and recalling and rebashing someone with their earlier mistakes - and that "someone" might be ourselves. We can be so hard on ourselves, often much more so than with others!</p>
<p>Now, like the Anti-Nephi-Lehies of the Book of Mormon, bury your weapons of war, and leave them buried. Forgive, and do that which is harder than to forgive: Forget. And when it comes to mind again, forget it again.</p>
<p>You can remember just enough to avoid repeating the mistake, but then put the rest of it all on the dung heap Paul spoke of to those Philippians. Dismiss the destructive and keep dismissing it until the beauty of the Atonement of Christ has revealed to you your bright future and the bright future of your family and your friends and your neighbors. God doesnt care nearly as much about where you have been as He does about where you are and, with His help, where you are willing to go. That is the thing Lots wife didnt get - and neither did Laman and Lemuel and a host of others in the scriptures.</p>
<p>This is an important matter to consider at the start of a new year - and every day ought to be the start of a new year and a new life. Such is the wonder of faith and repentance and the miracle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We started this hour with a little verse remembered from one of my BYU English classes. May I move toward a close with a few lines from another favorite poet whom I probably met in that same class or one similar to it. For the benefit of all BYU students in the new year of 2009, Robert Browning wrote:</p>
<p><i>Grow old along with me!</i></p>
<p><i>The best is yet to be,</i></p>
<p><i>The last of life, for which the first was made:</i></p>
<p><i>Our times are in His hand</i></p>
<p><i>Who saith, "A whole I planned,</i></p>
<p><i>Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!"</i></p>
<p>[<i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> (1864), stanza 1]</p>
<p>Sister Holland and I were married about the time both of us were reading poems like that in BYU classrooms. We were as starstruck - and as fearful - as most of you are at these ages and stages of life. We had absolutely no money. Zero. For a variety of reasons, neither of our families was able to help finance our education. We had a small apartment just south of campus - the smallest we could find: two rooms and a half bath. We were both working too many hours trying to stay afloat financially, but we had no other choice.</p>
<p>I remember one fall day - I think it was in the first semester after our marriage in 1963 - we were walking together up the hill past the Maeser Building on the sidewalk that led between the Presidents Home and the Brimhall Building. Somewhere on that path we stopped and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. Life that day seemed so overwhelming, and the undergraduate plus graduate years that we still anticipated before us seemed monumental, nearly insurmountable. Our love for each other and our commitment to the gospel were strong, but most of all the other temporal things around us seemed particularly ominous.</p>
<p>On a spot that I could probably still mark for you today, I turned to Pat and said something like this: "Honey, should we give up? I can get a good job and carve out a good living for us. I can do some things. Ill be okay without a degree. Should we stop trying to tackle what right now seems so difficult to face?"</p>
<p>In my best reenactment of Lots wife, I said, in effect, "Lets go back. Lets go home. The future holds nothing for us."</p>
<p>Then my beloved little bride did what she has done for 45 years since then. She grabbed me by the lapels and said, "We are not going back. We are not going home. The future holds <i>everything</i> for us."</p>
<p>She stood there in the sunlight that day and gave me a real talk. I dont recall that she quoted Paul, but there was certainly plenty in her voice that said she was committed to setting aside all that was past in order to "press toward the mark" and seize the prize of God that lay yet ahead. It was a living demonstration of faith. It was "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 11:1</a></span>). So we laughed, kept walking, and finished up sharing a root beer - one glass, two straws - at the then newly constructed Wilkinson Center.</p>
<p>Twenty years later I would, on occasion, look out of the window of the Presidents Home across the street from the Brimhall Building and picture there on the sidewalk two newlywed BYU students, down on their money and down even more on their confidence. And as I would gaze out that window, usually at night, I would occasionally see not Pat and Jeff Holland but you and you and you, walking that same sidewalk. I would see you sometimes as couples, sometimes as a group of friends, sometimes as just a lone student. I knew something of what you were feeling. Some of you were having thoughts such as these: Is there any future for me? What does a new year or a new semester or a new major or a new romance hold for me? Will I be safe? Will life be sound? Can I trust in the Lord and in the future? Or would it be better to look back, to go back, to go home?</p>
<p>To all such of every generation, I call out, "Remember Lots wife." Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that Christ truly is the "high priest of good things to come."</p>
<p>My young brothers and sisters, I pray you will have a wonderful semester, a wonderful new year, and a wonderful life all filled with faith and hope and charity. Keep your eyes on your dreams, however distant and far away. Live to see the miracles of repentance and forgiveness, of trust and divine love that will transform your life today, tomorrow, and forever. That is a New Years resolution I ask you to keep, and I leave a blessing on you - every one of you - to be able to do so and to be happy, in the name of Him who makes it all possible, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to explain the sequence of how I was first contacted to speak at this devotional. It was on a Monday that I got a text message from a number I didnt recognize. It had been a hectic day, and I didnt read the text fully. Thinking it was a request to speak at an upcoming Church assignment, I texted back politely asking who the text was from.
Matthew O. Richardson, BYU advancement vice president, responded that it was he who had sent the text asking me to speak at a BYU devotional.
The first thought that popped into my mind was, "Are you crazy? Do you not realize that I can barely speak the English language, let alone speak in front of so many people?"
My wife, who was with me at the time, responded without hesitation, "That is desperation, not inspiration!"
I texted President Richardson back with, "I think you have the wrong Craig Manning."
He then replied, "Oops, sorry, I do have the wrong person!" But he then clarified that he did have the right person.
As intimidating as it is to speak in front of you, the experience of preparing for this devotional has been great. I have found that every time I have put on the radio, in every activity I have participated in, and with every thought I have had, I have double-checked myself to make sure I was in alignment with the Holy Ghost so as to have the Spirit with me. I do pray that the Spirit will be with me today as I deliver my thoughts.
I would like to talk to you today about a couple of life-changing lessons the Lord has taught me.
I was born and raised in Canberra, Australia. My mother was, and still is, a Catholic, and my father was a member of the Church of England before he passed away from cancer twenty years ago. We attended church on Sundays, and I attended Sunday School, completing my first Holy Communion. As I got older, I started playing rugby. Games were on Sundays, and it wasnt long before we stopped attending church.
I remember coming home from a rugby game one Sunday when my mother said to me, "You are really good at sports, so you wont be very good at school."
This statement confused me. Although I didnt have the maturity and clarity of thought at the time to articulate my emotions, I can look back now and see why this statement bothered me. Was there some phenomenon that controlled my destiny? I couldnt help being good at sports; it just seemed to happen. Every time I participated in an athletic contest, I was reminded that I was a good athlete. So did that mean I had no chance of ever being a good student, and did I have any say in any of this?
I dont share this story to accuse my mother of bad parenting but rather to illustrate what can happen when we dont understand the Lords plan or, more important, when we dont learn to live and apply the gospel of Jesus Christ. I spent my teenage years focusing the majority of my attention on sports, par</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many who speak at a Brigham Young University devotional make reference to their experiences as students at BYU and the insights they have gained by attending devotionals. I cant do that because I never attended BYU. I am a Utah State University Aggie, and my Aggie blue runs deep. I am a big Cougar fan, but even after twenty years of holding season tickets for BYU basketball and football, I still cant bring myself to sing, "Rise and shout."
In those same twenty years I have also attended devotionals as a faculty member and have heard the testimonies of many of my colleagues and felt the spirit of many students as they have borne testimony through music. I am particularly humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today in a place where prophets and apostles have taught and testified.
Do We Really Believe in the Resurrection?
I am the youngest in a family of four boys, and about twenty-two years ago I was encouraged to apply for a faculty opening here at BYU in the Department of Mathematics. At the time, I was a faculty member at Oregon State University, and my three older brothers lived in Iowa, Washington, and California, while my parents lived in Logan, Utah. In addition to this being a great opportunity for me to come to BYU, it allowed me to be a little closer to my parents, because their health was failing.
My father did not want my decision to move to Utah to be based in any way on helping him and my mother. He was very proud of the fact that his sons were contributing to the kingdom outside of Utah. My wife, Shauna, and I felt that the move to BYU was the right decision, and we arrived here in August 1996.
Six months after our arrival in Provo, my father had surgery in Salt Lake City to repair a heart valve. Ten years earlier his original valve had been replaced with a pig valve, at which time he contracted hepatitis C. Because this pig valve was now failing, the doctors decided to replace it with a mechanical valve. During the surgery the doctors realized that the hepatitis C had wreaked havoc on my fathers liver, which made the heart surgery very traumatic on his body. This was the beginning of a seventeen-day roller coaster ride.
At this time my mothers health was not good, so she was only able to visit my dad about every two to three days. Thus the responsibility of visiting my father and communicating with the doctors fell to my wife and me. One or the other of us would travel from Mapleton, about ten miles south of Provo, to the hospital in Salt Lake City every day. Many times my wife would visit in the afternoon, and I would spend the evening at the hospital, or vice versa. This was particularly challenging because we had four children ranging in age from three to nine.
I referred to this time as a roller coaster ride because on one day a particular doctor would be pessimistic and on the next day another doctor would be optimistic about the eventual outcome.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is wonderful to be here with you. I am a Cougar through and through - I love BYU. While here I obtained both my undergraduate and graduate degrees, created lasting friendships, and convinced Shelley Hatch to take a risk on me. She was the first of the two of us to graduate from BYU and is the best thing I gained from being here. I hope your time as a student will be as productive as mine was!
After I was called as a General Authority, Sister Nash and I - along with our two youngest children - were assigned to Lima, Peru, where I would serve in the Area Presidency. On our first Monday there, we were given a brief driving tour so that we could learn how to get to and from places such as home, the childrens school, the grocery store, and other places. Then they handed me the keys to the car.
This sounds simple, but the streets of Lima can be bewildering. Even seasoned inhabitants get lost. The traffic is in constant flow and the streets curve, twist, and turn - and never seem to intersect with another street that will take you back to the exit you just missed. It can seem at times that the streets of Lima are designed to take the unwary exactly where they do not intend to go! So after driving for approximately five minutes that first day, I missed a turn and got us completely lost - and that was for a few hours.
A year or two later Sister Nash, driving on her own in Lima, got lost and ended up in a part of the city that was uncomfortable and even dangerous - and she did not know how to get home. Then, in a moment of inspiration, it came to her that our recently obtained GPS had a button marked Home. She pushed that button and was guided safely home.
My dear students, the plan of salvation - one of the greatest treasures of knowledge restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith - is a perfect, fully updated spiritual GPS. It is a celestial map given to unerringly guide us home.
Please listen to what I am about to say, even though you have heard it before. Listen as if you were hearing this for the first time: each of us "is a beloved . . . son or daughter of heavenly parents," and we lived with them prior to our mortal birth.1 Motivated by perfect love and a desire to give each of us as His children the opportunity to receive all He has, our Father in Heaven instituted a plan from before the foundation of this earth2 whereby we could obtain eternal life, "the greatest of all the gifts of God."3 Put simply, eternal life is the life God lives!4 This plan of salvation was - and is - based upon laws and truths that have always existed5 and that make God what He is and heaven what it is.6 When the plan was explained to us in the premortal realm, you and I not only "shouted for joy"7 but also defended the plan against those who opposed it.8
The plan required that this beautiful world be created to give us </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you for that beautiful and calming musical number. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today and for the support of family, colleagues, students, and friends who are here.
I invite you to reflect on the last time you experienced the feeling of fear. Was it while wondering if you would be admitted into one of the many competitive degree programs here at Brigham Young University? Or while waiting to see if the girl you asked out wants to go out again? Or, worse yet, while wondering what to do when she does? For me, the feeling is as recent as sitting on this stand, looking into the faces of so many and knowing that, through the miracle of technology, thousands more are watching this message. Like you, I can testify that the feeling of fear is real. Elder David A. Bednar taught about this powerful emotion in last Aprils general conference: "Notably, one of the first effects of the Fall was for Adam and Eve to experience fear.

Outlining several causes, the Lord declared, "And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you."3 Furthermore, He added, "Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time is past, and it is not expedient now."4
I have long wondered what it was that Oliver feared that caused him to not continue as he had commenced. Knowing that the project was of eternal importance, did he fear making a mistake and thus marring the sacred publication?
I was the age of most of you when this scriptural episode came to have special meaning for me. I was in graduate school here at BYU, and I began asking out a particular girl. And, as things progressed, I became scared. Like Ol</span>
