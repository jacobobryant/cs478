  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you, Bruce, for those kind comments and, Lenore, for that beautiful number that so effectively sets the stage for this devotional. I would like to speak about “The Two Great Promises,” but before I do that, I’d like to reflect briefly on some of the past.

As Provost Hafen indicated, I’m in the process of completing my service as dean of the College of Engineering and Technology. I’ve been at BYU this time around for twenty-seven years, since 1967, and twenty-four of these years I’ve been engaged in administrative work along with the wonderful work that professors do at the university.

When I first was called to be an administrative person, a department chair, Ernest Wilkinson was the president of the university—that dates back some time because that’s four presidents back. Our college counted about eight hundred student majors; now it’s over 3,000. When I first arrived on campus we were located in the Fletcher Building, south of the Bookstore. There were three of us in Chemical Engineering then. We taught all of the classes that were taught in the discipline, and we had just one part-time secretary.

President Wilkinson’s secretary called me when I first arrived and asked me if I would come over for an interview with President Wilkinson. It was his practice to interview all new faculty. In those days his office was at the Maeser Building. The Smoot Administration Building hadn’t been built. I said, “Yes,” and she set an appointment for the next day.

If you haven’t taught before, especially when facing new preparations for a first class experience, then you won’t fully appreciate this. I taught everything I knew the day I was teaching, and then I had to get ready for the next day by preparing all new material. I had three or four new preparations, and all I did night and day was prepare and present lectures. Well, when the next day came, you may have guessed, I worked right through that appointment. Nobody reminded me; I just worked right through it.

The secretary called and, of course, I was greatly embarrassed. She said, “Well, it’s okay. We’ll schedule it for tomorrow.” I accepted that appointment. Now, if you didn’t believe the first part, you’ll never believe this part. I worked right through that appointment the second day. After my second failure, the secretary called and said, “Brother Smoot, do you suppose that you could remember long enough to come now?”

Well, amazingly, I did. I do remember being in the upper area of the Maeser Building and talking to President Wilkinson, but I don’t remember so much about the conversation as I do about my efforts to arrive there.

That experience goes back to my first teaching days as a university faculty member. So much has changed since then. So much has changed in the physical plant and in the student body and in the faculty and in the university as a whole. We used to play football in a stadium where the Richards Building is now placed, and the seats were on the hillside. It held, if I recall, about ten thousand. A good neighbor and friend, Ab Swenson, was invited to speak at the Alumni Banquet several years ago in conjunction with his retirement. In reminiscing some, he said, “You know, when I first came to the university, Ott Romney was coaching the football team, and he also was assistant coach in basketball, and he coached the track team and assisted with baseball, and he taught history and he taught health.” Then he said, “How things have changed at the university. Now in football we have one coach for punting into the wind and another for punting with the wind.” That’s what you call a great transition. That may be an extreme, but it does paint the picture of the remarkable change at the university.

The Marriott Center wasn’t here. We played basketball—I played basketball for BYU in those days—in the Smith Fieldhouse. I had the experience of being on the team that played against Bill Russell and Casey Jones. Now the amazing thing is that BYU won that game against San Francisco. I haven’t forgotten the team—Boyd Jarman was our center; he teaches in physical education now—and I could name all of the players that played the key roles in that game. The Smith Fieldhouse also held about ten thousand fans. The Clyde Engineering Building wasn’t there, nor the Martin, Widtsoe, Tanner, Harris, or Talmage Buildings and others. This campus was a different place. And the enrollment—I don’t remember exactly what it was in 1967 when I returned to BYU. I’ll suppose about 13,000. It was about 6,000 when I was first a student here in 1952, and I wandered this campus well before that when there were only four permanent buildings on Temple Hill. What a remarkable transition. They used to whitewash the Y each year. Now they’ve found a more permanent way to manage that, and to even power the lights.

Well, I don’t mean by reflecting and reminiscing for a minute that I’m retiring. I’m just changing my position. I have the opportunity of returning to that marvelous position as a member of the faculty in our college, and I look forward greatly to that opportunity.

I’ve also had some anxiety about this particular presentation. This is not my first talk in a religious setting or on a religious topic. It is not my first talk in this auditorium or on the campus to the campus community. And it is not my first opportunity to speak in a professional setting. I’ve had the privilege of speaking around the world in one setting or another, but somehow this talk causes me more anxiety than other talks. I tried to determine the reasons for this feeling. It’s a different experience. I’ve never, to my recollection, given a talk on a religious or spiritual topic to my colleagues and students in a university setting. I’m not professional in the area of religious instruction, and yet there is something very special about this Church where lay people can seek to understand the scriptures and the intent of the Lord and not have to be a professional in the discipline in order to find testimony.

I have two simple objectives in talking to you this morning. One is to share with you my conviction about the sacred mission of this university, and the second is to share with you an equally strongly held conviction about the divinity of the Savior and the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.

A word about BYU then and about heritage and sacrifice. The university has elected to honor Abraham O. Smoot, my great grandfather. I take absolutely no credit for his contributions to the university, but I’m driven and motivated by his remarkable contributions here. This honoring will take place on Founders Day during Homecoming this fall, and all the Smoots are looking forward to a large family reunion. We held a reunion here in 1983 with nearly five hundred people in attendance. We look forward to helping the university honor him.

Abraham Smoot died in 1895, nearly a hundred years ago. In 1892 he said to his wife:

&lt;i&gt;Annie, I haven’t a piece of property that is not mortgaged. &lt;/i&gt;[And he was quite wealthy for his time.] &lt;i&gt;I have had to do it to raise money to keep the Brigham Young Academy going. That was given to me as a mission and I would sooner lose all, than fail in fulfilling this responsibility. I love that school and I can see what it means to our youth to have a spiritual as well as book learning. It must live. &lt;/i&gt;[C. Elliott Berlin, “Abraham Owen Smoot, Pioneer Mormon Leader” (master’s thesis, Brigham Young University, 1955), p. 161]

Well, live it did, through sacrifices of giants who have gone before us and made contributions like his. Why was it that Abraham Smoot thought of this as a mission? Well, I can tell you that story, too. It’s written in history (Marilyn McMeen Miller and John Clifton Moffitt, &lt;i&gt;Provo—A Story of People in Motion&lt;/i&gt;[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974], pp. 27–28). I’ve often wondered how true or how apocryphal it was, but it is written and documented. Brigham Young, in the 1870s, called A. O. Smoot into his office. He had been the mayor of Salt Lake and a Church leader in the Sugar House area and was very busy in the Church and in his business. Brigham Young said, according to the documented history,

&lt;i&gt;“I’m going to call you on a mission. There are three places, all on a par. One is as good as the other. They are Hell, Provo or Texas. You can take your choice.” A. O. replied, “I would sooner go to Hell than to Provo.” Apparently he didn’t give a second thought to Texas.&lt;/i&gt;

And Brigham Young is said to have responded, “Brother Smoot, if you don’t go to Provo, that’s exactly where you will go.”

Well, he went to Provo and gave away his personal fortune to save the Academy, which had struggled for years. He died in 1895, and the Academy was still struggling financially. Yet somehow, based on such sacrifice, we see about us a unique and remarkable institution.

When I walk this campus as I have done for over thirty-five of my fifty-nine years (I like to say “fifty-nine” because it changes soon into another decade), I imagine that I see the images of these giants who have gone before— great teachers, great scholars, faithful members of the Church, and benefactors who have made this place what it is now. Yet there’s so much to do.

I’d like to spend the balance of my time talking about the two great promises. From 2 Nephi 2:25 comes a very commonly known scripture among members of the Church—that “men are, that they might have joy”—and I presume that applies to all of God’s children. And it says in Mosiah,

&lt;i&gt;Consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.&lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 2:41]

There are remarkable promises for faithful members of the Church in Deuteronomy 7, starting with verse 11. I read such scriptures and then I look at my experiences over the last couple of decades of service in the Church and I see wonderful, faithful, worthy members of the Church who face challenges in their lives.

What kinds of challenges? All kinds of challenges. For some it is financial difficulty and setback. For others it may be disharmony in their relationships among family members. For still others it is that they can’t bear children. Some may have a wayward child. Others may lose a child or a partner through a premature death or accident. Such challenges that occur in people’s lives seem unlimited. I think about these things, and I see them among my neighbors and friends in the Oak Hills Stake and here at the university and in our family, and I think, “How can this be? If men are, and women are, that they might have joy, where is the joy in this kind of difficulty and challenge in life?”

Let me consider some specific examples, some from the scriptures, some from among my neighbors and friends, and some that have been reported in the news. First, you will recall in Alma 14 that Alma and Amulek had gone to the land of Ammonihah to call the people to repentance and to contend with Zeezrom. They were thrown into prison, and then scripture continues with verse 8:

&lt;i&gt;And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And . . . they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory.&lt;/i&gt;[Alma 14:8–11]

Here is a key about one of two great promises, that “the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory.” The scripture continues:

&lt;i&gt;And he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day. &lt;/i&gt;[Alma 14:11]

Now that answers a part of the question for me, but not all of it. I can understand that these people who did this terrible crime and caused the innocent women and children to be consumed at the stake would indeed face justice in the last day. But still I don’t find an answer in that scripture as to how come these, the innocent in life, must suffer so, if people are to have joy and if they have a blessed and happy state when they keep the commandments.

Let me next mention an Idaho family, Jeff and Joy Underwood, the parents of six children. You may recall, as vividly as I do, last July when it was reported on the television that their daughter Jeralee, age eleven, had gone out to collect for her paper route. Jeralee never returned, “not that day, nor the next day, nor the next, nor ever” to her family in Idaho (see James E. Faust, “Five Loaves and Two Fishes,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;May 1994, p. 6). After two thousand joined in the search, eventually Jeralee was found, abducted and brutally murdered. How does a family cope with this kind of tragedy? These are faithful members of the Church. Is that what you call joy, a state of happiness? The parents thanked the searchers and offered forgiveness.

Let me talk about a third example. One of the great passages of scripture to me that I just love, and that I recently read again from front to back, is the story of Job. As it says in the scripture, he was “a perfect and an upright man” (Job 1:8). Let’s think about Job for a minute. I love this interesting passage, too:

&lt;i&gt;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. &lt;/i&gt;[Job 1:6–7]

Well, I believe that even now the adversary goes to and fro and walks up and down in the earth.

&lt;i&gt;And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? &lt;/i&gt;[Job 1:8]

And then you’ll recall that the Lord gave Satan rights to everything but Job’s life to test his faith. And you will remember that Job lost his property and his prosperity—and he was a very wealthy man. He lost his personal health, being covered with boils, and suffered greatly, even to the point that his family abhorred his breath. And he lost his family, through death or accident, and his friends—and even God’s presence was taken from Job. His wife told him to curse God and die. Job’s friends told him that his suffering came from God as a punishment for his sins. Can you imagine the extent of his suffering? It doesn’t seem like a blessed and happy state. But Job said, “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (Job 1:21).

Now let’s turn to the Prophet Joseph Smith. It does seem an appropriate time to mention this great prophet because the 150th commemoration of his martyrdom in the Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, takes place this month. President Monson wrote a beautiful article—you may have read it already in the June 1994 issue of the &lt;i&gt;Ensign—&lt;/i&gt;about the examples that the Prophet Joseph set for us in so many ways. Think about his life. He was pursued. He was persecuted. He was tarred and feathered. He was imprisoned, and he was murdered. That doesn’t seem, somehow, like a blessed and happy state for one who kept the commandments.

What did the Lord tell Joseph Smith in prison in the Liberty Jail in March of 1839, 155 years ago? He said this:

&lt;i&gt;The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 122:1–7]

It reminds me of 2 Nephi 2:2, where it says, “Thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.” Somehow from these scriptures we obtain further insight that this blessed and happy state doesn’t mean a perfect joy in this life, because of the trials that are a natural part of our existence.

We don’t have to look into the scriptures or in our history for stories of this sort. There are countless examples in our own lives and among our friends, family, and acquaintances—possibly not of the magnitude of those that I’ve reported. Certainly not in my life, but possibly among some of you, stories and difficulties may reach those kind of challenges.

I think of the Briggs family, our loved neighbors, who a handful of years ago were journeying during the Christmas season up Spanish Fork Canyon. Their car slipped into the way of a large, oncoming truck, and four were killed. These were faithful members.

I think of my first counselor in the stake presidency, Bob Hales, when I was called to be a stake president seven-and-a-half years ago. We’d only served a year or so together when the winter season came. Bob, husband of President Janette Hales of the Young Women presidency, couldn’t sit for long periods at the desk as we did our work in the church. He blamed his old football knee. As the winter wore on and we all coughed from flu, his cough didn’t get better; then came that inevitable and sad time when he learned he had incurable cancer. He only lived for about three more weeks. Now, to me, he was a person without guile. He was a remarkable, faithful person, and yet his life was taken.

How can this be? How is it that our “Father which is in heaven,” as it says in Matthew 5:45, “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust”? Is the answer in Alma enough that this provides a judgment for those who help to commit these transgressions? Not all of these difficulties are caused by others through their sin and transgression. Some just seem to happen, and people ask the questions “Why this?” and “Why me?”

Well, I’ve struggled with this issue myself and sought to counsel members, and when you’re in a position of counseling you want to bring some kind of comfort and reassurance to these people. Let me share some additional views with you about this issue. I found some insight regarding the two great promises from the scriptures that I’ve shared already, but there is more that brings me comfort and, I hope, to those of you and others who face trials, because they are in all of our lives.

In D&amp;amp;C 101:36, we read, “In this world your joy is not full.” Well, you don’t have to conduct a research project for your college class to demonstrate that. You just look around in the lives of people to see that that is the case. The Savior goes on to say, “In me your joy is full.” Somehow, this fullness of joy doesn’t come in this particular existence but through the Lord and, presumably, through exaltation.

We read further in the second chapter of 2 Nephi about the necessity of having opposition in all things in that great message from Father Lehi. To me, this chapter is one of the greatest in all of scripture. I’ve already referenced it twice for other purposes, and it includes Lehi’s marvelous message on opposition. Light with darkness, pleasure with pain, and life with death are a natural part of our existence in this life. Now in Ether, Moroni says, where he inserts a thought, “For ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith” (Ether 12:6).

Let me return briefly to D&amp;amp;C 121, again referring to the Prophet Joseph:

&lt;i&gt;My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]

Here again is reference to one of the two great promises, the fact that we have the prospect of resurrection and exaltation if we just endure to the end. Then, as it says, “God shall exalt thee on high.” That seems clear. Such testimony is borne by those who have come back after being clinically dead. Several books now document the overwhelming feeling of light and peace that people testify to about this joy of being in the presence of a perfect being.

But how about this life? What about the first great promise? Well, there’s a scripture I like particularly well that, to me, brings peace and comfort. It is Alma 36:3. There Alma counsels his son Helaman, “Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions.” Now, it doesn’t say there in the scriptures—and I don’t know where to find it in the scriptures—that if you put your trust in the Lord, he will eliminate the trials and the challenges and the afflictions and the troubles of life. I just don’t seem to find that in the scriptures. So we accept this—this opposition, the good with the bad, the light with the darkness, the pleasure with the pain, and the life with the death—as an inevitable part of this wonderful life. Alma 36:3 then finishes with “and shall be lifted up at the last day.” Here, in one scripture, we see recorded the two great promises: support in trials and exaltation.

Now please don’t misinterpret just how glorious life on earth can be, and what opportunities there are here for us, and how thrilling it is to see the sunshine and the clouds and to see the rain and the water and the mountains and everything that makes our life meaningful, and to have families and to share love—all are enriching experiences. But there is opposition, and with all of this come the challenges of life as well.

So I sense, brothers and sisters, that the promise of life is not that you will, even as faithful people, be exempted from the trials and the troubles and afflictions of life. Such will be a natural and inevitable part of our existence in this life. I do see that we can cope with these challenges in life according to the promise if we put our trust in the Lord. Now, to me, that means to do his bidding, to do his will, to keep his commandments. That is, to me, what it means to trust in the Lord.

Let me go back to these people of whom I spoke earlier. I saw this trust in the Lord in Bob Hales. He said this to me as I had the privilege to give him a blessing just prior to his passing: “Doug, I am not afraid to die. I’ve put my hand in the hand of the Lord, and I know that he could make me well if he willed it, but it doesn’t matter.” And then, with a courageous sense of humor, even amidst the pain, he said (and he was a physician), “I guess I will not worry so much about my cholesterol level.”

I saw this trust in the Underwood family. Sister Underwood said,

&lt;i&gt;I have learned a lot about love this week, and I also know there is a lot of hate. I have looked at the love and want to feel that love, and not the hate. We can forgive. &lt;/i&gt;[Faust, &lt;i&gt;Five Loaves, &lt;/i&gt;p. 7]

Now, do you have this much trust in the Lord? Could you say that if you had just lost a child to a violent murder, and could you make that statement in the same week?

The Prophet said in a letter to his wife Emma:

&lt;i&gt;God is my friend. In him I shall find comfort. I have given my life into his hands. I am prepared to go at his call. I desire to be with Christ. I count not my life dear to me, only to do his will. &lt;/i&gt;[Dean C. Jessee, comp., &lt;i&gt;The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1984), p. 239; spelling and punctuation modernized]

And Job said,

&lt;i&gt;For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. &lt;/i&gt;[Job 19:25–26]

It does seem possible, brothers and sisters, to find peace amidst sorrow. Look at these remarkable examples of these four people—some our neighbors and friends, some scriptural, some living in an adjacent state—who somehow found that kind of peace and comfort through trusting the Lord in times of tremendous trial. We can, through trust in the Lord, be strengthened to cope with the challenges of life, and we can be lifted up at the last day to a state of fullness of joy. We can be partakers of these promises.

Now may I share closing thoughts about the university and the Church. I want you to know that I willingly and gladly support and accept the environment and standards at BYU. Some have suggested that the university cannot achieve a respected place in the academic world under its policies and practices. I am prepared to let the quality and the accomplishments of the university’s graduates—you students who will represent this church and this university so well—together with the scholarly and professional contributions of our faculty colleagues, settle this matter. I believe that diversity in academic approaches is a virtue. I believe that the university is unique in its teaching and in its purpose and its mission, and I wholeheartedly support this mission. I want to do everything I can to further it. I love this university, and I am committed to its mission.

Now, about the gospel of Jesus Christ: I firmly believe and testify that if we trust God by doing his will, we will be strengthened in our trials and our troubles and our afflictions, and we will find happiness and joy, even in this life—though not perfect joy, not a full joy—and we can also be lifted up at the last day in a state of never-ending joy. I leave you this witness, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Thank you, Bruce, for those kind comments and, Lenore, for that beautiful number that so effectively sets the stage for this devotional. I would like to speak about “The Two Great Promises,” but before I do that, I’d like to reflect briefly on some of the past.</p>
<p>As Provost Hafen indicated, I’m in the process of completing my service as dean of the College of Engineering and Technology. I’ve been at BYU this time around for twenty-seven years, since 1967, and twenty-four of these years I’ve been engaged in administrative work along with the wonderful work that professors do at the university.</p>
<p>When I first was called to be an administrative person, a department chair, Ernest Wilkinson was the president of the university—that dates back some time because that’s four presidents back. Our college counted about eight hundred student majors; now it’s over 3,000. When I first arrived on campus we were located in the Fletcher Building, south of the Bookstore. There were three of us in Chemical Engineering then. We taught all of the classes that were taught in the discipline, and we had just one part-time secretary.</p>
<p>President Wilkinson’s secretary called me when I first arrived and asked me if I would come over for an interview with President Wilkinson. It was his practice to interview all new faculty. In those days his office was at the Maeser Building. The Smoot Administration Building hadn’t been built. I said, “Yes,” and she set an appointment for the next day.</p>
<p>If you haven’t taught before, especially when facing new preparations for a first class experience, then you won’t fully appreciate this. I taught everything I knew the day I was teaching, and then I had to get ready for the next day by preparing all new material. I had three or four new preparations, and all I did night and day was prepare and present lectures. Well, when the next day came, you may have guessed, I worked right through that appointment. Nobody reminded me; I just worked right through it.</p>
<p>The secretary called and, of course, I was greatly embarrassed. She said, “Well, it’s okay. We’ll schedule it for tomorrow.” I accepted that appointment. Now, if you didn’t believe the first part, you’ll never believe this part. I worked right through that appointment the second day. After my second failure, the secretary called and said, “Brother Smoot, do you suppose that you could remember long enough to come now?”</p>
<p>Well, amazingly, I did. I do remember being in the upper area of the Maeser Building and talking to President Wilkinson, but I don’t remember so much about the conversation as I do about my efforts to arrive there.</p>
<p>That experience goes back to my first teaching days as a university faculty member. So much has changed since then. So much has changed in the physical plant and in the student body and in the faculty and in the university as a whole. We used to play football in a stadium where the Richards Building is now placed, and the seats were on the hillside. It held, if I recall, about ten thousand. A good neighbor and friend, Ab Swenson, was invited to speak at the Alumni Banquet several years ago in conjunction with his retirement. In reminiscing some, he said, “You know, when I first came to the university, Ott Romney was coaching the football team, and he also was assistant coach in basketball, and he coached the track team and assisted with baseball, and he taught history and he taught health.” Then he said, “How things have changed at the university. Now in football we have one coach for punting into the wind and another for punting with the wind.” That’s what you call a great transition. That may be an extreme, but it does paint the picture of the remarkable change at the university.</p>
<p>The Marriott Center wasn’t here. We played basketball—I played basketball for BYU in those days—in the Smith Fieldhouse. I had the experience of being on the team that played against Bill Russell and Casey Jones. Now the amazing thing is that BYU won that game against San Francisco. I haven’t forgotten the team—Boyd Jarman was our center; he teaches in physical education now—and I could name all of the players that played the key roles in that game. The Smith Fieldhouse also held about ten thousand fans. The Clyde Engineering Building wasn’t there, nor the Martin, Widtsoe, Tanner, Harris, or Talmage Buildings and others. This campus was a different place. And the enrollment—I don’t remember exactly what it was in 1967 when I returned to BYU. I’ll suppose about 13,000. It was about 6,000 when I was first a student here in 1952, and I wandered this campus well before that when there were only four permanent buildings on Temple Hill. What a remarkable transition. They used to whitewash the Y each year. Now they’ve found a more permanent way to manage that, and to even power the lights.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t mean by reflecting and reminiscing for a minute that I’m retiring. I’m just changing my position. I have the opportunity of returning to that marvelous position as a member of the faculty in our college, and I look forward greatly to that opportunity.</p>
<p>I’ve also had some anxiety about this particular presentation. This is not my first talk in a religious setting or on a religious topic. It is not my first talk in this auditorium or on the campus to the campus community. And it is not my first opportunity to speak in a professional setting. I’ve had the privilege of speaking around the world in one setting or another, but somehow this talk causes me more anxiety than other talks. I tried to determine the reasons for this feeling. It’s a different experience. I’ve never, to my recollection, given a talk on a religious or spiritual topic to my colleagues and students in a university setting. I’m not professional in the area of religious instruction, and yet there is something very special about this Church where lay people can seek to understand the scriptures and the intent of the Lord and not have to be a professional in the discipline in order to find testimony.</p>
<p>I have two simple objectives in talking to you this morning. One is to share with you my conviction about the sacred mission of this university, and the second is to share with you an equally strongly held conviction about the divinity of the Savior and the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>A word about BYU then and about heritage and sacrifice. The university has elected to honor Abraham O. Smoot, my great grandfather. I take absolutely no credit for his contributions to the university, but I’m driven and motivated by his remarkable contributions here. This honoring will take place on Founders Day during Homecoming this fall, and all the Smoots are looking forward to a large family reunion. We held a reunion here in 1983 with nearly five hundred people in attendance. We look forward to helping the university honor him.</p>
<p>Abraham Smoot died in 1895, nearly a hundred years ago. In 1892 he said to his wife:</p>
<p><i>Annie, I haven’t a piece of property that is not mortgaged. </i>[And he was quite wealthy for his time.] <i>I have had to do it to raise money to keep the Brigham Young Academy going. That was given to me as a mission and I would sooner lose all, than fail in fulfilling this responsibility. I love that school and I can see what it means to our youth to have a spiritual as well as book learning. It must live. </i>[C. Elliott Berlin, “Abraham Owen Smoot, Pioneer Mormon Leader” (master’s thesis, Brigham Young University, 1955), p. 161]</p>
<p>Well, live it did, through sacrifices of giants who have gone before us and made contributions like his. Why was it that Abraham Smoot thought of this as a mission? Well, I can tell you that story, too. It’s written in history (Marilyn McMeen Miller and John Clifton Moffitt, <i>Provo—A Story of People in Motion</i>[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974], pp. 27–28). I’ve often wondered how true or how apocryphal it was, but it is written and documented. Brigham Young, in the 1870s, called A. O. Smoot into his office. He had been the mayor of Salt Lake and a Church leader in the Sugar House area and was very busy in the Church and in his business. Brigham Young said, according to the documented history,</p>
<p><i>“I’m going to call you on a mission. There are three places, all on a par. One is as good as the other. They are Hell, Provo or Texas. You can take your choice.” A. O. replied, “I would sooner go to Hell than to Provo.” Apparently he didn’t give a second thought to Texas.</i></p>
<p>And Brigham Young is said to have responded, “Brother Smoot, if you don’t go to Provo, that’s exactly where you will go.”</p>
<p>Well, he went to Provo and gave away his personal fortune to save the Academy, which had struggled for years. He died in 1895, and the Academy was still struggling financially. Yet somehow, based on such sacrifice, we see about us a unique and remarkable institution.</p>
<p>When I walk this campus as I have done for over thirty-five of my fifty-nine years (I like to say “fifty-nine” because it changes soon into another decade), I imagine that I see the images of these giants who have gone before— great teachers, great scholars, faithful members of the Church, and benefactors who have made this place what it is now. Yet there’s so much to do.</p>
<p>I’d like to spend the balance of my time talking about the two great promises. From 2 Nephi 2:25 comes a very commonly known scripture among members of the Church—that “men are, that they might have joy”—and I presume that applies to all of God’s children. And it says in Mosiah,</p>
<p><i>Consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.</i>[Mosiah 2:41]</p>
<p>There are remarkable promises for faithful members of the Church in Deuteronomy 7, starting with verse 11. I read such scriptures and then I look at my experiences over the last couple of decades of service in the Church and I see wonderful, faithful, worthy members of the Church who face challenges in their lives.</p>
<p>What kinds of challenges? All kinds of challenges. For some it is financial difficulty and setback. For others it may be disharmony in their relationships among family members. For still others it is that they can’t bear children. Some may have a wayward child. Others may lose a child or a partner through a premature death or accident. Such challenges that occur in people’s lives seem unlimited. I think about these things, and I see them among my neighbors and friends in the Oak Hills Stake and here at the university and in our family, and I think, “How can this be? If men are, and women are, that they might have joy, where is the joy in this kind of difficulty and challenge in life?”</p>
<p>Let me consider some specific examples, some from the scriptures, some from among my neighbors and friends, and some that have been reported in the news. First, you will recall in Alma 14 that Alma and Amulek had gone to the land of Ammonihah to call the people to repentance and to contend with Zeezrom. They were thrown into prison, and then scripture continues with verse 8:</p>
<p><i>And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And . . . they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.</i></p>
<p><i>And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory.</i>[Alma 14:8–11]</p>
<p>Here is a key about one of two great promises, that “the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory.” The scripture continues:</p>
<p><i>And he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day. </i>[Alma 14:11]</p>
<p>Now that answers a part of the question for me, but not all of it. I can understand that these people who did this terrible crime and caused the innocent women and children to be consumed at the stake would indeed face justice in the last day. But still I don’t find an answer in that scripture as to how come these, the innocent in life, must suffer so, if people are to have joy and if they have a blessed and happy state when they keep the commandments.</p>
<p>Let me next mention an Idaho family, Jeff and Joy Underwood, the parents of six children. You may recall, as vividly as I do, last July when it was reported on the television that their daughter Jeralee, age eleven, had gone out to collect for her paper route. Jeralee never returned, “not that day, nor the next day, nor the next, nor ever” to her family in Idaho (see James E. Faust, “Five Loaves and Two Fishes,” <i>Ensign, </i>May 1994, p. 6). After two thousand joined in the search, eventually Jeralee was found, abducted and brutally murdered. How does a family cope with this kind of tragedy? These are faithful members of the Church. Is that what you call joy, a state of happiness? The parents thanked the searchers and offered forgiveness.</p>
<p>Let me talk about a third example. One of the great passages of scripture to me that I just love, and that I recently read again from front to back, is the story of Job. As it says in the scripture, he was “a perfect and an upright man” (Job 1:8). Let’s think about Job for a minute. I love this interesting passage, too:</p>
<p><i>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.</i></p>
<p><i>And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. </i>[Job 1:6–7]</p>
<p>Well, I believe that even now the adversary goes to and fro and walks up and down in the earth.</p>
<p><i>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? </i>[Job 1:8]</p>
<p>And then you’ll recall that the Lord gave Satan rights to everything but Job’s life to test his faith. And you will remember that Job lost his property and his prosperity—and he was a very wealthy man. He lost his personal health, being covered with boils, and suffered greatly, even to the point that his family abhorred his breath. And he lost his family, through death or accident, and his friends—and even God’s presence was taken from Job. His wife told him to curse God and die. Job’s friends told him that his suffering came from God as a punishment for his sins. Can you imagine the extent of his suffering? It doesn’t seem like a blessed and happy state. But Job said, “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (Job 1:21).</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the Prophet Joseph Smith. It does seem an appropriate time to mention this great prophet because the 150th commemoration of his martyrdom in the Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, takes place this month. President Monson wrote a beautiful article—you may have read it already in the June 1994 issue of the <i>Ensign—</i>about the examples that the Prophet Joseph set for us in so many ways. Think about his life. He was pursued. He was persecuted. He was tarred and feathered. He was imprisoned, and he was murdered. That doesn’t seem, somehow, like a blessed and happy state for one who kept the commandments.</p>
<p>What did the Lord tell Joseph Smith in prison in the Liberty Jail in March of 1839, 155 years ago? He said this:</p>
<p><i>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</i></p>
<p><i>. . . and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</i></p>
<p><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. </i>[D&amp;C 122:1–7]</p>
<p>It reminds me of 2 Nephi 2:2, where it says, “Thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.” Somehow from these scriptures we obtain further insight that this blessed and happy state doesn’t mean a perfect joy in this life, because of the trials that are a natural part of our existence.</p>
<p>We don’t have to look into the scriptures or in our history for stories of this sort. There are countless examples in our own lives and among our friends, family, and acquaintances—possibly not of the magnitude of those that I’ve reported. Certainly not in my life, but possibly among some of you, stories and difficulties may reach those kind of challenges.</p>
<p>I think of the Briggs family, our loved neighbors, who a handful of years ago were journeying during the Christmas season up Spanish Fork Canyon. Their car slipped into the way of a large, oncoming truck, and four were killed. These were faithful members.</p>
<p>I think of my first counselor in the stake presidency, Bob Hales, when I was called to be a stake president seven-and-a-half years ago. We’d only served a year or so together when the winter season came. Bob, husband of President Janette Hales of the Young Women presidency, couldn’t sit for long periods at the desk as we did our work in the church. He blamed his old football knee. As the winter wore on and we all coughed from flu, his cough didn’t get better; then came that inevitable and sad time when he learned he had incurable cancer. He only lived for about three more weeks. Now, to me, he was a person without guile. He was a remarkable, faithful person, and yet his life was taken.</p>
<p>How can this be? How is it that our “Father which is in heaven,” as it says in Matthew 5:45, “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust”? Is the answer in Alma enough that this provides a judgment for those who help to commit these transgressions? Not all of these difficulties are caused by others through their sin and transgression. Some just seem to happen, and people ask the questions “Why this?” and “Why me?”</p>
<p>Well, I’ve struggled with this issue myself and sought to counsel members, and when you’re in a position of counseling you want to bring some kind of comfort and reassurance to these people. Let me share some additional views with you about this issue. I found some insight regarding the two great promises from the scriptures that I’ve shared already, but there is more that brings me comfort and, I hope, to those of you and others who face trials, because they are in all of our lives.</p>
<p>In D&amp;C 101:36, we read, “In this world your joy is not full.” Well, you don’t have to conduct a research project for your college class to demonstrate that. You just look around in the lives of people to see that that is the case. The Savior goes on to say, “In me your joy is full.” Somehow, this fullness of joy doesn’t come in this particular existence but through the Lord and, presumably, through exaltation.</p>
<p>We read further in the second chapter of 2 Nephi about the necessity of having opposition in all things in that great message from Father Lehi. To me, this chapter is one of the greatest in all of scripture. I’ve already referenced it twice for other purposes, and it includes Lehi’s marvelous message on opposition. Light with darkness, pleasure with pain, and life with death are a natural part of our existence in this life. Now in Ether, Moroni says, where he inserts a thought, “For ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith” (Ether 12:6).</p>
<p>Let me return briefly to D&amp;C 121, again referring to the Prophet Joseph:</p>
<p><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i></p>
<p><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high. </i>[D&amp;C 121:7–8]</p>
<p>Here again is reference to one of the two great promises, the fact that we have the prospect of resurrection and exaltation if we just endure to the end. Then, as it says, “God shall exalt thee on high.” That seems clear. Such testimony is borne by those who have come back after being clinically dead. Several books now document the overwhelming feeling of light and peace that people testify to about this joy of being in the presence of a perfect being.</p>
<p>But how about this life? What about the first great promise? Well, there’s a scripture I like particularly well that, to me, brings peace and comfort. It is Alma 36:3. There Alma counsels his son Helaman, “Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions.” Now, it doesn’t say there in the scriptures—and I don’t know where to find it in the scriptures—that if you put your trust in the Lord, he will eliminate the trials and the challenges and the afflictions and the troubles of life. I just don’t seem to find that in the scriptures. So we accept this—this opposition, the good with the bad, the light with the darkness, the pleasure with the pain, and the life with the death—as an inevitable part of this wonderful life. Alma 36:3 then finishes with “and shall be lifted up at the last day.” Here, in one scripture, we see recorded the two great promises: support in trials and exaltation.</p>
<p>Now please don’t misinterpret just how glorious life on earth can be, and what opportunities there are here for us, and how thrilling it is to see the sunshine and the clouds and to see the rain and the water and the mountains and everything that makes our life meaningful, and to have families and to share love—all are enriching experiences. But there is opposition, and with all of this come the challenges of life as well.</p>
<p>So I sense, brothers and sisters, that the promise of life is not that you will, even as faithful people, be exempted from the trials and the troubles and afflictions of life. Such will be a natural and inevitable part of our existence in this life. I do see that we can cope with these challenges in life according to the promise if we put our trust in the Lord. Now, to me, that means to do his bidding, to do his will, to keep his commandments. That is, to me, what it means to trust in the Lord.</p>
<p>Let me go back to these people of whom I spoke earlier. I saw this trust in the Lord in Bob Hales. He said this to me as I had the privilege to give him a blessing just prior to his passing: “Doug, I am not afraid to die. I’ve put my hand in the hand of the Lord, and I know that he could make me well if he willed it, but it doesn’t matter.” And then, with a courageous sense of humor, even amidst the pain, he said (and he was a physician), “I guess I will not worry so much about my cholesterol level.”</p>
<p>I saw this trust in the Underwood family. Sister Underwood said,</p>
<p><i>I have learned a lot about love this week, and I also know there is a lot of hate. I have looked at the love and want to feel that love, and not the hate. We can forgive. </i>[Faust, <i>Five Loaves, </i>p. 7]</p>
<p>Now, do you have this much trust in the Lord? Could you say that if you had just lost a child to a violent murder, and could you make that statement in the same week?</p>
<p>The Prophet said in a letter to his wife Emma:</p>
<p><i>God is my friend. In him I shall find comfort. I have given my life into his hands. I am prepared to go at his call. I desire to be with Christ. I count not my life dear to me, only to do his will. </i>[Dean C. Jessee, comp., <i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1984), p. 239; spelling and punctuation modernized]</p>
<p>And Job said,</p>
<p><i>For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</i></p>
<p><i>And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. </i>[Job 19:25–26]</p>
<p>It does seem possible, brothers and sisters, to find peace amidst sorrow. Look at these remarkable examples of these four people—some our neighbors and friends, some scriptural, some living in an adjacent state—who somehow found that kind of peace and comfort through trusting the Lord in times of tremendous trial. We can, through trust in the Lord, be strengthened to cope with the challenges of life, and we can be lifted up at the last day to a state of fullness of joy. We can be partakers of these promises.</p>
<p>Now may I share closing thoughts about the university and the Church. I want you to know that I willingly and gladly support and accept the environment and standards at BYU. Some have suggested that the university cannot achieve a respected place in the academic world under its policies and practices. I am prepared to let the quality and the accomplishments of the university’s graduates—you students who will represent this church and this university so well—together with the scholarly and professional contributions of our faculty colleagues, settle this matter. I believe that diversity in academic approaches is a virtue. I believe that the university is unique in its teaching and in its purpose and its mission, and I wholeheartedly support this mission. I want to do everything I can to further it. I love this university, and I am committed to its mission.</p>
<p>Now, about the gospel of Jesus Christ: I firmly believe and testify that if we trust God by doing his will, we will be strengthened in our trials and our troubles and our afflictions, and we will find happiness and joy, even in this life—though not perfect joy, not a full joy—and we can also be lifted up at the last day in a state of never-ending joy. I leave you this witness, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I would like to let my staff, my students, and my athletes know that I am just as surprised as you are to see me up here, but please don’t let it shake your testimony or your confidence in BYU.
When I was about four years old, I fell out of my bed. My father heard me crying and came into my room to check on me. As he helped me get back into my bed, he asked, with all of the compassion of a loving father, why I had fallen out of bed.
He always loved to tell me how I had looked up at him and said, with the eye roll of a rational four-year-old, “Obviously I wasn’t in far enough!”
As a result, that statement became the question that my father would ask me every time I encountered a struggle, trial, or difficult problem. To this day I continue to ask myself, “Am I in far enough?”
I don’t want to burst your bubble by telling you that this life will include tests, trials, and tribulations and that some of the trials you will face in life will be excruciating. What you do need to know is that, according to my friends, I am not the luckiest person in the world and I have had my share of challenges. We will all experience affliction, so I hope that sharing how I learned to get all the way in will help you along your path in college and in life.
Riding Out the Raging Tempests
I remember being a student at this ­university. I came from a great home and was raised by incredible parents who shared their ­testimonies through word and deed. I felt confident as I entered BYU that I had a solid footing in the Church. However, it was during my college life that I started to experience small struggles that began to test my testimony and my commitment to our Savior.
It started with having to make my own ­decisions to go to church, say my prayers, and read my scriptures. And then came the self-doubt, the struggle of suddenly being average, the loneliness, and the experience of my first C grade being thrown at me. Next came the curveball of dating and breaking up combined with a “small” amount of pressure to get married, all while I was ­living with roommates who did not do the dishes and also while no one was liking my Instagram posts—well, at least back then I didn’t have to worry about Instagram or Facebook.
It was at a particularly low moment in college that I came across the hymn “Master, the Tempest Is Raging” (Hymns, 2002, no. 105). The second verse described perfectly how I was feeling at that moment:
Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today.
The depths of my sad heart are troubled.
Oh, waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o’er my sinking soul,
And I perish! I perish! dear Master.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Roughly one decade after the end of World War II, Samuel Beckett completed his second play, Endgame. The title refers to the final portion of a chess match—the outcome pretty much decided but the pieces still needing to be moved. At one point, just over halfway through Endgame’s action—if one can call it that—the character Hamm, frustrated with the unassailability of his reality, utters, “You’re on earth, there’s no cure for that!” (Samuel Beckett, Endgame: A Play in One Act [New York: Grove Press, 1958], 53, 68).
In the decades since I first came across this line, I have spent a good deal of time thinking about its implications in the context of the play, in the context of Beckett’s life, and in the context of life in the contemporary Western world. But what have occupied my thinking much more often are the implications of this line in the context of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
I speak today as one “on earth”—as one subject to the pains, hardships, and uncertainties constituent of life on earth. As such, I do not know that I will provide many answers. Instead, what I hope to do is raise questions. More correctly, my intention today is to invite you to join me in engaging in the conditions of uncertainty that are a divinely designed part of what it means to be on earth. This is an invitation to examine what it means to be on earth while being subject to the restrictions of being on earth. So I invite you to explore along with me. This is admittedly more difficult in a lecture environment, but I believe we can move together in thought, each making his or her own momentary excursions into familiar or uncharted waters but returning intermittently to common questions and issues.
My hope is that we can learn together. In his discussion of learning, the philosopher Gilles Deleuze asserted that there is only so much a swimming instructor can teach a student on the sand. The instructor needs to take the student into the water, where the swimmer’s body can learn to negotiate the weight and movement of the waves (see Gilles Deleuze, Difference and Repetition, trans. Paul Patton [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 23). By the same logic, at some point the instructor must also let go of the swimmer.
Those of us on earth know about being let go. It is frightening but exhilarating too. It is a burdensome and wonderful thing. I ask you to keep this in mind for the next little while, for while some patches of what I have prepared will be quite clear—maybe even a Sunday School review for us—other patches may be a bit purple as I attempt to negotiate the weight and movement of the waves that I have been experiencing. Thus it is with soberness and joy that I speak to you today as we think together here “on earth.” I pray that the Spirit of the Lord attends us.
My talk comprises three sections: (1) The Blessed Fall, (2) Thinking and Playing on Eart</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In the summer of 2001 I was serving as a counselor in the stake Young Women presidency in Stillwater, Oklahoma. For various reasons the stake presidency had come to us and asked us to plan for the next year’s girls’ camp at a state park within our stake boundaries. The park we ended up selecting had fewer affordable recreational opportunities than our previous location.
We considered a variety of new activities, each with their pluses and minuses. As a Girl Scout leader in Stillwater, I had learned that the local Girl Scout Council provided a two-day course through the National Archery Development Association that gave participants the training to be able to teach basic principles of archery and run a safe archery range. Obtaining the certification would give us access to a substantial discount in purchasing simple recurve bows and arrows. Through personal contacts at the local university I had determined that we could borrow Ethafoam targets and other basic equipment we would need to create a fun and safe experience for our Young Women. The girls loved this new activity. Even after I was released from the presidency, I received an annual invitation to attend girls’ camp to run the archery program.
The so-called “fee” for attending the archery training was that I had my name added to a list of adults certified as level-one archery instructors who were willing to be called upon to run the archery range at various Girl Scout camp locations throughout the council. When it came time to renew my certification, I was asked to consider going through the level-two training, which meant that I would be able to teach the two-day, level-one course that I had previously taken. The level-two training was much more in-depth, focusing in greater detail on various equipment options, physical properties of various types of bows and arrows, refinement of shooting technique, and even how to use a bow string jig, a device that allows you to make a custom bow string.
At about the time I finished the level-two training and passed the written exam, I started rereading the Book of Mormon. With all of my newly acquired archery knowledge, when I came to the account of Nephi’s bow breaking in 1 Nephi 16, I realized for the first time what a truly remarkable story this is. Like much of the Book of Mormon narrative, it is full of understatement. Because none of us here—well, probably none of us—is hunting with a bow as the sole means of providing dietary protein for ourselves or our families and because none of us is currently living in the extreme environment of the Arabian Peninsula, we take the brief details of the story at their simple face value. But doing so means we are not fully appreciating a number of important teachings found in these verses.
While the book of 1 Nephi is probably the most read, or at least the most often read, book in the Book of Mormon, I want to recall for you the details of this particular story. N</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am humbled and thankful to be among so many friends today and to see so many of my current and former students. Thank you for this opportunity, President Worthen.
I grew up on a large cattle ranch, first near Eureka, Nevada, and later in Kanosh, Utah. I would start the days very early by catching and saddling my horse in the moonlit and frosty morning hours. As the first rays of sunshine would start coming over the mountains, the cowboys I was working with would scatter out and begin looking for cows and calves from among sagebrush flats and juniper-covered hillsides. The sight was surreal as I would watch hundreds of cows and calves being herded toward a corral to be branded and vaccinated.
As a young boy I aspired to be able to rope the calves as my part of the branding. Alternative responsibilities entailed wrestling the calves to the ground, oftentimes resulting in me getting kicked or run over. At about the age of seven, after repeated failures in tackling the calves, I was finally allowed to try my hand at roping. I remember proudly getting my lasso rope ready and searching out the smallest and slowest-looking calf in the herd. I carefully planned my throw, and I felt the thrill of accomplishment when the loop settled over the calf successfully. Though the calf was seemingly small and slow, I felt its tremendous force start to jerk me off my horse. Despite trying my best to hold onto the calf, I found that my strength was no match for him. Just as I was being violently jerked out of my saddle, I heard a wise cowboy yell across to me: “Dally up!”
To dally means to take the rope and making two or three quick wraps around the saddle horn. The saddle becomes an anchor point, which connects to the greater strength of a steady and powerful horse. The dally transformed my situation of having inadequate personal strength to being able to access a greater power that anchored the turbulent polar forces acting upon me. This simple act allowed me to draw strength from something far greater than myself. Instead of being violently yanked from my saddle, I found the relative ease of letting my horse do the pulling while I had the much more simple and manageable task of holding the dally tight and maintaining the connection to the anchoring force.
Many times in my life since then I have felt the strength of greater powers than I have been prepared to withstand. These have seemed to yank me from a place of security and comfort. Each time, I have reflected upon opportunities to dally up to a power greater than my own that can serve as an anchor of strength. I would like to share some of the points of my learning about how to dally up in our inevitable circumstances and the need to find our anchor during turbulent times in our lives:
1. Strength in service
2. Strength in involvement
3. Strength in commitments
Strength in Service
