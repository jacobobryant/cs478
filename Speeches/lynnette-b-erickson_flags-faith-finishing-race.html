  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My brothers and sisters, it is an honor and a privilege to be here with you today.

Some years ago I taught third grade in Gilbert, Arizona, with a woman who had just moved there from Indiana. Every year just before Memorial Day she would hang black-and-white-checkered flags from the ceiling of her classroom and would create for her students thematic studies focused on the Indianapolis 500 car race. All of her excitement piqued my interest in race car driving and the Indy 500. To be honest, much of my curiosity came from the concept of driving in a circle for 500 miles.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The first Indy race was in 1911, and the competition has continued to grow into the event that it is today. Regardless of the weather or other conditions, the race has taken place every year except during World Wars I and II, when the track was used as a landing runway for U.S. aircraft. Drivers who participate in this race have to qualify for one of the limited number of prestigious spots available by proving they have the knowledge, skills, experience, and resources that will allow them to win the race. The motivation for participating in the Indy 500 is not only a love of racing but also the multimillion dollar prize that goes to the winner.

If you have ever watched even part of one of these races, you know that the drivers go at breakneck speeds of over 200 miles an hour around the track, weaving in and out of the other cars, cutting some off to get ahead in the race, and often skimming the wall to pass the competition. This is a dangerous sport not only for the drivers but also for the support teams and spectators. Great precautions have been taken to reduce the risks to those participating in and watching the race, yet over 40 drivers, 20 crewmembers, and 10 spectators have been killed since the first Indy 500.

Although it first seemed to me that the cars were just driving around in circles and going nowhere, I now realize that for the drivers who have qualified for the race, it is a carefully planned and calculated effort to be the first to safely cross the finish line.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lifes Race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Id like to compare the Indy 500 to our lives. We go through life and its various experiences - many joyful and some challenging - at a rapid pace. Our race began in the pre-earth life when we were introduced to and chose to be a part of Heavenly Fathers great plan of happiness. We qualified for the race in the grand councils of heaven when we stood with the Savior and chose agency and righteousness. Having qualified, we came into this life prepared with everything we needed to succeed.

Regardless of the conditions, our task is to participate in the race, safely cross the finish line, and receive the grand prize. Our motivation is the priceless prize designated for finishers of the race - that of eternal life. An important part of the race of life is that the Creator of the plan knows who we are and has given us the necessary conditions and tools for successfully completing our race. Additionally, He has promised to guide us on our path. Isnt it wonderful to know that Heavenly Father loves us and knows us individually?

We are promised in 1 Nephi 9:6 that "the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words." Knowing this, we are ready for our race.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
During the Indy 500, race officials and pit crews have the job of tending the track, monitoring the conditions, clearing debris, and keeping the drivers apprised of the various conditions of the track, possible obstructions, or potential dangers. The way race officials communicate to the drivers is through the use of flags. Some of these flags have been standardized to mean the same thing to all drivers, while others are unique to a particular driver and his team. It is up to the driver to know what the signals mean and to heed the communication in order to race safely and effectively.

For example, the green flag signals the beginning of the race, the yellow flag cautions drivers to slow down due to hazards on the track, and the yellow-and-red-striped flag warns drivers that there is something on the track that could reduce grip or cause a car to lose control. The red flag tells drivers that conditions are too unsafe to continue the race and that the car must stop. The white flag signals to the driver that there is one lap remaining in the race, and the waving of the black-and-white-checkered flag signals the driver that the scheduled distance has been met and the race is over. All the racers understand these flags.

Individualized flags are used to communicate important messages with one driver at a time. For example, the black flag summons a car into the pits due to a mechanical problem or because the driver has disobeyed a rule. Each crew also has special flags that are used to communicate specific messages to their driver.

On the racetrack, anything that takes the driver off the course, slows him down, or distracts him from moving toward the finish line is a pitfall. The objective during the race is to avoid as many of these pitfalls as possible. Oil on the track, gravel, encounters with other drivers, going too fast or too slow, and mechanical malfunctions all increase the risk of the driver being harmed, taken off the course, or not making it to the finish line.

In life we are all on a risky course, and at times we dont have the experience or perspective to see the pitfalls on the track ahead of us. As on a raceway, individuals who know the course well provide signals that help us understand the conditions we are facing so we can respond appropriately to them. Communication from the Lord comes in many forms as He warns us of pitfalls and dangers and tells us of joys and blessings that we can experience as we proceed through life. He also reminds us of the goals we are working toward and encourages us in our journey.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flags of Warning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In our race, the road conditions arent always apparent to us and, on our own, we may not always perceive threats to our progress. Thankfully, the Lord warns us about pitfalls globally through His prophets, scriptures, and doctrine. But He also warns us individually through the quiet promptings of the Spirit to let us know how to adjust our journey. He has also given us a pit crew, so to speak, who help us avoid possible hazards on our course. Consider some of the pitfalls our crew has recently warned us about.

Inspired leaders have warned of the importance of protecting our bodies, minds, and spirits from those influences that would harm us or diminish our ability to stay on course. Just as the race car driver wears a sturdy helmet and clothing appropriate for his task, we are admonished to gird ourselves in the whole armor of God in our dress, in our thoughts, and in our actions.

Another pitfall that we have been warned of is the influence of the media and technology in our lives. Like all powerful things, these can influence us both positively and negatively. The reason media present potential hazards is that their messages can distort, alter, block out, or supersede the more eternal and important messages from a loving Heavenly Father. The media directly attack our sense of direction, our purpose, and our sense of who we are. We need to know that what is largely represented in the media isnt reality in an eternal sense. Studying the scriptures, doing temple work, developing relationships with family and friends, participating in physical activities, and rendering service are some of the things that we have been counseled to do in the plan the Lord has created for us. Oftentimes we allow the media to have greater and greater influence in our lives, leaving us little time to attend to more meaningful activities that keep us moving in the direction of the finish line. How much time do you spend studying the scriptures, praying, and listening to the word of the Lord in comparison to the time you spend texting, e-mailing, blogging, and listening to the messages of the media?

In April 2009 general conference, Elder Robert D. Hales addressed another pitfall - the danger of debt. He counseled us all to learn to live "joyfully . . . within our means, [to be] content with what we have, [avoid] excessive debt, and diligently [save] and [prepare] for rainy-day emergencies" ("&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Becoming Provident Providers Temporally and Spiritually&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2009, 8). You may say to yourself, "Hey, Ill think about that when I am out of school or married or have an income." But the flag of warning is for all to heed now. Each of us must be careful to live within our means and even put a little away for emergencies. Current economic conditions show the wisdom in this counsel. Heeding this flag of warning not only protects us from hazards but also blesses us in ways that we cannot predict or imagine.

In that same conference, other Church leaders reminded us of the importance of attending the temple, honoring our covenants, serving others, learning from the past, exercising faith, trusting in the Lord, and following other important guides that will help us. As we heed the warnings and guidelines of the prophet and our leaders, we can avoid those things that would stand in the way of our goal of reaching the finish line.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refueling Our Faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In the Indy 500, there are times when the officials or the drivers team recognize that both the car and driver need to be recharged and refueled. These pit stops are essential to ensuring that the cars engine is running efficiently, the tires have enough tread to be safe, fluid levels are full, and the driver is able to continue the race. In our lives we also have occasions when we need to take time out to refuel, repair, recharge, and realign our testimonies so we can better steer our course. Church leaders, the scriptures, caring family members, the Holy Ghost, and patriarchal blessings all provide substance and vision to keep us moving toward the finish line.

In the most recent general conference, President Thomas S. Monson taught us how to focus on the road beyond a possible pitfall. He spoke of all there is in the world today to be depressed about - financial downturns, social and moral decline, wars, natural disasters, and personal hardships. He admonished us, however, not to dwell on the negative in the world and rather to focus on the blessings we have as members of the Church. He encouraged us as he closed his remarks, "My beloved brothers and sisters, fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith" ("&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/be-of-good-cheer?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Be of Good Cheer&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2009, 92).

When we are struggling on our raceway or when we need extra encouragement to keep going, the Lord often allows us to have experiences that help us to know that He is aware of us and helping us along. As only a loving Father can, He also provides individualized communication to us through answers to prayer. These messages are often very personal and direct.

In the fall of 2000 I had an assignment to attend a series of meetings at BYUHawaii. I had my last chemotherapy treatment the morning I was to fly out of Salt Lake City. After I left the clinic, I went directly to the airport. By the time I arrived at the Los Angeles airport, I was feeling very ill. I checked my luggage, and by the time I got to my departure gate, I was absolutely miserable. As I sat down, leaning against the wall, I thought about the coach seats in the plane and how tight it would be with people on both sides of me. I felt even sicker as I contemplated the four- or five-hour flight. I silently thought, "Heavenly Father, would it be so bad if I was in first class today?" The thought came and left.

Almost immediately the woman at the check-in counter came over to me and asked my name. Finding out that I was indeed Lynnette Erickson, she asked if I would be willing to be bumped to the next flight to allow a family to fly together. Apparently the flight was overbooked and the plane was filled to capacity. By this time I felt so bad that I didnt care if I ever got to Hawaii, so I said yes. The arrangements were made, and the plane left the gate. Not ten minutes later the same woman came back with my new tickets and, to my surprise, informed me that the next plane would be leaving in just 30 minutes. As she was leaving, she turned back to me and asked, "By the way, do you mind if you are in seat A1?" A1, of course, was in the first-class section of the plane. While some may say that this was a coincidence, in my mind this was nothing short of a miracle, and I knew that Heavenly Father was aware of me and my needs.

Elder David A. Bednar referred to these individualized answers to our prayers as "tender mercies" in our lives:

&lt;i&gt;The Lords tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . The Lords tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We should not underestimate or overlook the power of the Lords tender mercies.&lt;/i&gt; ["&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Tender Mercies of the Lord&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2005, 99100]

What do these tender mercies look like in your life? How does the Lord answer your personal prayers? How does He affirm to you that you are on course? The answers to these questions are for you to ponder and then, as President Henry B. Eyring instructed, to recognize how the Lord communicates His tender mercies to us and to remember them (see "&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;O Remember, Remember&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2007, 6669).

President Spencer W. Kimball reaffirmed that God not only knows us and watches over us but He also often sends others to deliver His message to us (see "&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Small Acts of Service&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; December 1974, 27). These members of our racing team include priesthood leaders who are aware of our needs and act upon spiritual promptings.

My daughter competed for a prestigious award in her senior year of high school that required several months of intense preparation and hard work. After passing several stages of competition, she reached the point of being one of 15 finalists for the award. It was a stressful time for her, and she was concerned about being able to demonstrate her abilities and talents. One Sunday morning before Church, our stake president made a point of congratulating her on her achievement. Then he took her hand, looked her squarely in the eyes, and said, "No matter what happens, &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; know who you are." To my daughter, and to all of us, that was a crowning point. Yes, she knew what she had put into preparing for the award and also what she had gained from it. Unlike the Indy 500, the final burst of speed was not the measure of her success. No matter what the judges decided in their assessment, she was a winner, and those who loved her, including the Lord, recognized her accomplishments.

One of the Lords most powerful ways to relay messages to us is through the Holy Ghost. If we have prepared ourselves to receive and follow His communications, we can more successfully avoid the dangers along our course, and we will feel the peace and joy of the journey during the race. Messages from the Holy Ghost are quiet and still. Therefore, we must be willing to tune out the world and continually listen for and to his promptings. In his devotional speech here at BYU in January 2007, Elder Boyd K. Packer admonished:

&lt;i&gt;You live in an interesting generation where trials will be constant in your life. Learn to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It is to be a shield and a protection and a teacher for you. &lt;/i&gt;["&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_lehis-dream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lehis Dream and You&lt;/a&gt;," BYU devotional address, 16 January 2007]

When we are looking for direction, guidance, and encouragement in our lives, reading and pondering the scriptures allows us to know the will of the Lord for us. In 2 Nephi 32:3 we are encouraged to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do." As we read the words of those who have traveled the course before us, we find courage and strength to learn from them and finish the race.

Our patriarchal blessings also provide warnings and guidance tailored to our specific needs. Elder Richard D. Allred said:

&lt;i&gt;These blessings are inspired and are personal revelations to the recipient. Patriarchal blessings are a guideline or similar to a road map that indicates the paths that may be traveled and destinations that may be reached if we stay within those paths. They may bring comfort and joy and encouragement when we have need to look, to listen, and to feel of the contents of these blessings so that we may go forward on lifes journey, not alone, but with the accompanying Spirit of our Father in Heaven.&lt;/i&gt; ["&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/10/the-lord-blesses-his-children-through-patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Lord Blesses His Children Through Patriarchal Blessings&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1997, 28]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finishing the Race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
What a blessing it is to recognize that the Lord has a plan for us and that He always has and will continue to guide, warn, and encourage us on our course. We have the guides and the tools to get us there. But lets be realistic. This race isnt easy - it is grueling. The Indy 500 is 200 times around the arena, and it is dangerous! Our race has eternal significance. It is our test, and the course isnt flat, nor is it straight. Trials will come and life will be challenging, but we need to know and remember Heavenly Father is there, and we must have faith that the flags and guides that He has prepared will help us achieve our ultimate goal.

In our race to the finish line, we need to anticipate and be ready for unexpected events that may hamper us on our course and detour us from our goal. Sometimes we dont anticipate that life doesnt always go as we dreamed or planned. When this happens, we may be tempted to think that Heavenly Father has forsaken us and reject the flags and guides that have been provided. We cannot think this way - we must stay in the race and keep our focus on the finish line. Elder Dallin H. Oaks gently reminded us that:

&lt;i&gt;Many important things will occur in our lives that we have not planned, and not all of them will be welcome. . . . Even our most righteous desires may elude us, or come in different ways or at different times than we have sought to plan.&lt;/i&gt; ["&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_timing/&quot;&gt;Timing&lt;/a&gt;," BYU devotional address, 29 January 2002]

Like each of you, I have had my share of unexpected detours in my race. I had planned on marrying shortly after college, having 24 children, and being a stay-at-home mom. Instead I married at an older age and only for a very short time, have only one child, and am a woman with a profession. My life wasnt how I had planned or even imagined it, but I have been richly blessed with perspective and patience, understanding of the Lords timing, and a lovely daughter who is my friend. The lesson here is to keep going, keep building the kingdom, keep improving yourself, stay worthy of His blessings and His love, and stay on the course!

Remember, His timetable doesnt always look like ours. Disappointments will happen - you can count on it. But if you keep yourself focused on the finish line and what is really important, your disappointments will eventually fade. Elder Quentin L. Cook encouraged us when he said, "Even though our journey may be fraught with tribulation, the destination is truly glorious" ("&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/our-fathers-plan-big-enough-for-all-his-children?lang=eng&quot;&gt;Our Fathers Plan - Big Enough for All His Children&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2009, 37).

Sometimes we might think of trials as pitfalls when, in fact, they may be the very things that help us stay on course. President Eyring taught us that none of us is exempt from trials and challenges. He helps us to understand that "we all must deal with adversity" ("&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/adversity?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Adversity&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2009, 23), and that even though trials arent something we seek after, they are times when we can exercise our faith and grow from the experiences. He also taught us that we have to learn to get through the trials, that there are lessons to be learned, and that we cant bypass or skip certain parts of the race because they are unpleasant. During these times we need to pray like Nephi for our strength to be increased to get through and to learn the needed lessons the trial affords.

Knowing that our destination is the greatest gift that we can receive, we must be faithful and press on in order to achieve our goal. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf urged us to remember that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the answer to our problems and challenges and that we must continue faithful:

&lt;i&gt;Brothers and sisters, we have to stay with it. We dont acquire eternal life in a sprint - this is a race of endurance. We have to apply and reapply the divine gospel principles. Day after day we need to make them part of our normal life.&lt;/i&gt; ["&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/the-way-of-the-disciple?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Way of the Disciple&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2009, 76]

I live in a community where many of my dear friends are dealing with physical challenges of varying types and degrees - the kind of trials that most of us may eventually have to accept as we progress into the twilight of our lives. I am impressed and humbled to observe that in spite of their challenges, they continue constant in their race along the course, always focused on the finish line. These experienced ones have the wisdom to know "that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Ecclesiastes 9:11). My seasoned senior friends and neighbors are noble examples of those who continue fighting a good fight, pressing forward to finish their course, and keeping the faith (see 2 Timothy 4:7).

In the history of the Indy 500, there has only been one winner each year. Fortunately that isnt true in the race of life. In our race, the winners circle is not limited to just one person; in fact, the circle will expand to encompass all those who finish the race. My brothers and sisters, my testimony to you today is that our Heavenly Father has a perfect plan for us. His plan is for all of us to live eternally with Him. We have qualified for the race of this earth life and, though the race course may at times be rough and obstacles may get in our way, we each must navigate our own course successfully. It is up to us to exercise our faith, follow the flags and warnings that He provides, and keep moving toward the finish line. Keep moving, brothers and sisters. Watch for the flags along the way. If you heed their messages of warning and encouragement and apply them in your lives, you will cross the finish line - you will achieve the prize. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>My brothers and sisters, it is an honor and a privilege to be here with you today.</p>
<p>Some years ago I taught third grade in Gilbert, Arizona, with a woman who had just moved there from Indiana. Every year just before Memorial Day she would hang black-and-white-checkered flags from the ceiling of her classroom and would create for her students thematic studies focused on the Indianapolis 500 car race. All of her excitement piqued my interest in race car driving and the Indy 500. To be honest, much of my curiosity came from the concept of driving in a circle for 500 miles.</p>
<h2><b>The Race</b></h2>
<p>The first Indy race was in 1911, and the competition has continued to grow into the event that it is today. Regardless of the weather or other conditions, the race has taken place every year except during World Wars I and II, when the track was used as a landing runway for U.S. aircraft. Drivers who participate in this race have to qualify for one of the limited number of prestigious spots available by proving they have the knowledge, skills, experience, and resources that will allow them to win the race. The motivation for participating in the Indy 500 is not only a love of racing but also the multimillion dollar prize that goes to the winner.</p>
<p>If you have ever watched even part of one of these races, you know that the drivers go at breakneck speeds of over 200 miles an hour around the track, weaving in and out of the other cars, cutting some off to get ahead in the race, and often skimming the wall to pass the competition. This is a dangerous sport not only for the drivers but also for the support teams and spectators. Great precautions have been taken to reduce the risks to those participating in and watching the race, yet over 40 drivers, 20 crewmembers, and 10 spectators have been killed since the first Indy 500.</p>
<p>Although it first seemed to me that the cars were just driving around in circles and going nowhere, I now realize that for the drivers who have qualified for the race, it is a carefully planned and calculated effort to be the first to safely cross the finish line.</p>
<h2><b>Lifes Race</b></h2>
<p>Id like to compare the Indy 500 to our lives. We go through life and its various experiences - many joyful and some challenging - at a rapid pace. Our race began in the pre-earth life when we were introduced to and chose to be a part of Heavenly Fathers great plan of happiness. We qualified for the race in the grand councils of heaven when we stood with the Savior and chose agency and righteousness. Having qualified, we came into this life prepared with everything we needed to succeed.</p>
<p>Regardless of the conditions, our task is to participate in the race, safely cross the finish line, and receive the grand prize. Our motivation is the priceless prize designated for finishers of the race - that of eternal life. An important part of the race of life is that the Creator of the plan knows who we are and has given us the necessary conditions and tools for successfully completing our race. Additionally, He has promised to guide us on our path. Isnt it wonderful to know that Heavenly Father loves us and knows us individually?</p>
<p>We are promised in 1 Nephi 9:6 that "the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words." Knowing this, we are ready for our race.</p>
<h2><b>Flags</b></h2>
<p>During the Indy 500, race officials and pit crews have the job of tending the track, monitoring the conditions, clearing debris, and keeping the drivers apprised of the various conditions of the track, possible obstructions, or potential dangers. The way race officials communicate to the drivers is through the use of flags. Some of these flags have been standardized to mean the same thing to all drivers, while others are unique to a particular driver and his team. It is up to the driver to know what the signals mean and to heed the communication in order to race safely and effectively.</p>
<p>For example, the green flag signals the beginning of the race, the yellow flag cautions drivers to slow down due to hazards on the track, and the yellow-and-red-striped flag warns drivers that there is something on the track that could reduce grip or cause a car to lose control. The red flag tells drivers that conditions are too unsafe to continue the race and that the car must stop. The white flag signals to the driver that there is one lap remaining in the race, and the waving of the black-and-white-checkered flag signals the driver that the scheduled distance has been met and the race is over. All the racers understand these flags.</p>
<p>Individualized flags are used to communicate important messages with one driver at a time. For example, the black flag summons a car into the pits due to a mechanical problem or because the driver has disobeyed a rule. Each crew also has special flags that are used to communicate specific messages to their driver.</p>
<p>On the racetrack, anything that takes the driver off the course, slows him down, or distracts him from moving toward the finish line is a pitfall. The objective during the race is to avoid as many of these pitfalls as possible. Oil on the track, gravel, encounters with other drivers, going too fast or too slow, and mechanical malfunctions all increase the risk of the driver being harmed, taken off the course, or not making it to the finish line.</p>
<p>In life we are all on a risky course, and at times we dont have the experience or perspective to see the pitfalls on the track ahead of us. As on a raceway, individuals who know the course well provide signals that help us understand the conditions we are facing so we can respond appropriately to them. Communication from the Lord comes in many forms as He warns us of pitfalls and dangers and tells us of joys and blessings that we can experience as we proceed through life. He also reminds us of the goals we are working toward and encourages us in our journey.</p>
<h2><b>Flags of Warning</b></h2>
<p>In our race, the road conditions arent always apparent to us and, on our own, we may not always perceive threats to our progress. Thankfully, the Lord warns us about pitfalls globally through His prophets, scriptures, and doctrine. But He also warns us individually through the quiet promptings of the Spirit to let us know how to adjust our journey. He has also given us a pit crew, so to speak, who help us avoid possible hazards on our course. Consider some of the pitfalls our crew has recently warned us about.</p>
<p>Inspired leaders have warned of the importance of protecting our bodies, minds, and spirits from those influences that would harm us or diminish our ability to stay on course. Just as the race car driver wears a sturdy helmet and clothing appropriate for his task, we are admonished to gird ourselves in the whole armor of God in our dress, in our thoughts, and in our actions.</p>
<p>Another pitfall that we have been warned of is the influence of the media and technology in our lives. Like all powerful things, these can influence us both positively and negatively. The reason media present potential hazards is that their messages can distort, alter, block out, or supersede the more eternal and important messages from a loving Heavenly Father. The media directly attack our sense of direction, our purpose, and our sense of who we are. We need to know that what is largely represented in the media isnt reality in an eternal sense. Studying the scriptures, doing temple work, developing relationships with family and friends, participating in physical activities, and rendering service are some of the things that we have been counseled to do in the plan the Lord has created for us. Oftentimes we allow the media to have greater and greater influence in our lives, leaving us little time to attend to more meaningful activities that keep us moving in the direction of the finish line. How much time do you spend studying the scriptures, praying, and listening to the word of the Lord in comparison to the time you spend texting, e-mailing, blogging, and listening to the messages of the media?</p>
<p>In April 2009 general conference, Elder Robert D. Hales addressed another pitfall - the danger of debt. He counseled us all to learn to live "joyfully . . . within our means, [to be] content with what we have, [avoid] excessive debt, and diligently [save] and [prepare] for rainy-day emergencies" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becoming Provident Providers Temporally and Spiritually</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 8). You may say to yourself, "Hey, Ill think about that when I am out of school or married or have an income." But the flag of warning is for all to heed now. Each of us must be careful to live within our means and even put a little away for emergencies. Current economic conditions show the wisdom in this counsel. Heeding this flag of warning not only protects us from hazards but also blesses us in ways that we cannot predict or imagine.</p>
<p>In that same conference, other Church leaders reminded us of the importance of attending the temple, honoring our covenants, serving others, learning from the past, exercising faith, trusting in the Lord, and following other important guides that will help us. As we heed the warnings and guidelines of the prophet and our leaders, we can avoid those things that would stand in the way of our goal of reaching the finish line.</p>
<h2><b>Refueling Our Faith</b></h2>
<p>In the Indy 500, there are times when the officials or the drivers team recognize that both the car and driver need to be recharged and refueled. These pit stops are essential to ensuring that the cars engine is running efficiently, the tires have enough tread to be safe, fluid levels are full, and the driver is able to continue the race. In our lives we also have occasions when we need to take time out to refuel, repair, recharge, and realign our testimonies so we can better steer our course. Church leaders, the scriptures, caring family members, the Holy Ghost, and patriarchal blessings all provide substance and vision to keep us moving toward the finish line.</p>
<p>In the most recent general conference, President Thomas S. Monson taught us how to focus on the road beyond a possible pitfall. He spoke of all there is in the world today to be depressed about - financial downturns, social and moral decline, wars, natural disasters, and personal hardships. He admonished us, however, not to dwell on the negative in the world and rather to focus on the blessings we have as members of the Church. He encouraged us as he closed his remarks, "My beloved brothers and sisters, fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/be-of-good-cheer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be of Good Cheer</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 92).</p>
<p>When we are struggling on our raceway or when we need extra encouragement to keep going, the Lord often allows us to have experiences that help us to know that He is aware of us and helping us along. As only a loving Father can, He also provides individualized communication to us through answers to prayer. These messages are often very personal and direct.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2000 I had an assignment to attend a series of meetings at BYUHawaii. I had my last chemotherapy treatment the morning I was to fly out of Salt Lake City. After I left the clinic, I went directly to the airport. By the time I arrived at the Los Angeles airport, I was feeling very ill. I checked my luggage, and by the time I got to my departure gate, I was absolutely miserable. As I sat down, leaning against the wall, I thought about the coach seats in the plane and how tight it would be with people on both sides of me. I felt even sicker as I contemplated the four- or five-hour flight. I silently thought, "Heavenly Father, would it be so bad if I was in first class today?" The thought came and left.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the woman at the check-in counter came over to me and asked my name. Finding out that I was indeed Lynnette Erickson, she asked if I would be willing to be bumped to the next flight to allow a family to fly together. Apparently the flight was overbooked and the plane was filled to capacity. By this time I felt so bad that I didnt care if I ever got to Hawaii, so I said yes. The arrangements were made, and the plane left the gate. Not ten minutes later the same woman came back with my new tickets and, to my surprise, informed me that the next plane would be leaving in just 30 minutes. As she was leaving, she turned back to me and asked, "By the way, do you mind if you are in seat A1?" A1, of course, was in the first-class section of the plane. While some may say that this was a coincidence, in my mind this was nothing short of a miracle, and I knew that Heavenly Father was aware of me and my needs.</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar referred to these individualized answers to our prayers as "tender mercies" in our lives:</p>
<p><i>The Lords tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . The Lords tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>We should not underestimate or overlook the power of the Lords tender mercies.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tender Mercies of the Lord</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 99100]</p>
<p>What do these tender mercies look like in your life? How does the Lord answer your personal prayers? How does He affirm to you that you are on course? The answers to these questions are for you to ponder and then, as President Henry B. Eyring instructed, to recognize how the Lord communicates His tender mercies to us and to remember them (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O Remember, Remember</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 6669).</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball reaffirmed that God not only knows us and watches over us but He also often sends others to deliver His message to us (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Acts of Service</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1974, 27). These members of our racing team include priesthood leaders who are aware of our needs and act upon spiritual promptings.</p>
<p>My daughter competed for a prestigious award in her senior year of high school that required several months of intense preparation and hard work. After passing several stages of competition, she reached the point of being one of 15 finalists for the award. It was a stressful time for her, and she was concerned about being able to demonstrate her abilities and talents. One Sunday morning before Church, our stake president made a point of congratulating her on her achievement. Then he took her hand, looked her squarely in the eyes, and said, "No matter what happens, <i>we</i> know who you are." To my daughter, and to all of us, that was a crowning point. Yes, she knew what she had put into preparing for the award and also what she had gained from it. Unlike the Indy 500, the final burst of speed was not the measure of her success. No matter what the judges decided in their assessment, she was a winner, and those who loved her, including the Lord, recognized her accomplishments.</p>
<p>One of the Lords most powerful ways to relay messages to us is through the Holy Ghost. If we have prepared ourselves to receive and follow His communications, we can more successfully avoid the dangers along our course, and we will feel the peace and joy of the journey during the race. Messages from the Holy Ghost are quiet and still. Therefore, we must be willing to tune out the world and continually listen for and to his promptings. In his devotional speech here at BYU in January 2007, Elder Boyd K. Packer admonished:</p>
<p><i>You live in an interesting generation where trials will be constant in your life. Learn to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It is to be a shield and a protection and a teacher for you. </i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_lehis-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lehis Dream and You</a>," BYU devotional address, 16 January 2007]</p>
<p>When we are looking for direction, guidance, and encouragement in our lives, reading and pondering the scriptures allows us to know the will of the Lord for us. In 2 Nephi 32:3 we are encouraged to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do." As we read the words of those who have traveled the course before us, we find courage and strength to learn from them and finish the race.</p>
<p>Our patriarchal blessings also provide warnings and guidance tailored to our specific needs. Elder Richard D. Allred said:</p>
<p><i>These blessings are inspired and are personal revelations to the recipient. Patriarchal blessings are a guideline or similar to a road map that indicates the paths that may be traveled and destinations that may be reached if we stay within those paths. They may bring comfort and joy and encouragement when we have need to look, to listen, and to feel of the contents of these blessings so that we may go forward on lifes journey, not alone, but with the accompanying Spirit of our Father in Heaven.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/10/the-lord-blesses-his-children-through-patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lord Blesses His Children Through Patriarchal Blessings</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1997, 28]</p>
<h2><b>Finishing the Race</b></h2>
<p>What a blessing it is to recognize that the Lord has a plan for us and that He always has and will continue to guide, warn, and encourage us on our course. We have the guides and the tools to get us there. But lets be realistic. This race isnt easy - it is grueling. The Indy 500 is 200 times around the arena, and it is dangerous! Our race has eternal significance. It is our test, and the course isnt flat, nor is it straight. Trials will come and life will be challenging, but we need to know and remember Heavenly Father is there, and we must have faith that the flags and guides that He has prepared will help us achieve our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>In our race to the finish line, we need to anticipate and be ready for unexpected events that may hamper us on our course and detour us from our goal. Sometimes we dont anticipate that life doesnt always go as we dreamed or planned. When this happens, we may be tempted to think that Heavenly Father has forsaken us and reject the flags and guides that have been provided. We cannot think this way - we must stay in the race and keep our focus on the finish line. Elder Dallin H. Oaks gently reminded us that:</p>
<p><i>Many important things will occur in our lives that we have not planned, and not all of them will be welcome. . . . Even our most righteous desires may elude us, or come in different ways or at different times than we have sought to plan.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_timing/">Timing</a>," BYU devotional address, 29 January 2002]</p>
<p>Like each of you, I have had my share of unexpected detours in my race. I had planned on marrying shortly after college, having 24 children, and being a stay-at-home mom. Instead I married at an older age and only for a very short time, have only one child, and am a woman with a profession. My life wasnt how I had planned or even imagined it, but I have been richly blessed with perspective and patience, understanding of the Lords timing, and a lovely daughter who is my friend. The lesson here is to keep going, keep building the kingdom, keep improving yourself, stay worthy of His blessings and His love, and stay on the course!</p>
<p>Remember, His timetable doesnt always look like ours. Disappointments will happen - you can count on it. But if you keep yourself focused on the finish line and what is really important, your disappointments will eventually fade. Elder Quentin L. Cook encouraged us when he said, "Even though our journey may be fraught with tribulation, the destination is truly glorious" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/our-fathers-plan-big-enough-for-all-his-children?lang=eng">Our Fathers Plan - Big Enough for All His Children</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 37).</p>
<p>Sometimes we might think of trials as pitfalls when, in fact, they may be the very things that help us stay on course. President Eyring taught us that none of us is exempt from trials and challenges. He helps us to understand that "we all must deal with adversity" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/adversity?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adversity</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 23), and that even though trials arent something we seek after, they are times when we can exercise our faith and grow from the experiences. He also taught us that we have to learn to get through the trials, that there are lessons to be learned, and that we cant bypass or skip certain parts of the race because they are unpleasant. During these times we need to pray like Nephi for our strength to be increased to get through and to learn the needed lessons the trial affords.</p>
<p>Knowing that our destination is the greatest gift that we can receive, we must be faithful and press on in order to achieve our goal. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf urged us to remember that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the answer to our problems and challenges and that we must continue faithful:</p>
<p><i>Brothers and sisters, we have to stay with it. We dont acquire eternal life in a sprint - this is a race of endurance. We have to apply and reapply the divine gospel principles. Day after day we need to make them part of our normal life.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/the-way-of-the-disciple?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Way of the Disciple</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 76]</p>
<p>I live in a community where many of my dear friends are dealing with physical challenges of varying types and degrees - the kind of trials that most of us may eventually have to accept as we progress into the twilight of our lives. I am impressed and humbled to observe that in spite of their challenges, they continue constant in their race along the course, always focused on the finish line. These experienced ones have the wisdom to know "that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Ecclesiastes 9:11). My seasoned senior friends and neighbors are noble examples of those who continue fighting a good fight, pressing forward to finish their course, and keeping the faith (see 2 Timothy 4:7).</p>
<p>In the history of the Indy 500, there has only been one winner each year. Fortunately that isnt true in the race of life. In our race, the winners circle is not limited to just one person; in fact, the circle will expand to encompass all those who finish the race. My brothers and sisters, my testimony to you today is that our Heavenly Father has a perfect plan for us. His plan is for all of us to live eternally with Him. We have qualified for the race of this earth life and, though the race course may at times be rough and obstacles may get in our way, we each must navigate our own course successfully. It is up to us to exercise our faith, follow the flags and warnings that He provides, and keep moving toward the finish line. Keep moving, brothers and sisters. Watch for the flags along the way. If you heed their messages of warning and encouragement and apply them in your lives, you will cross the finish line - you will achieve the prize. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Introduction - It Is Easier to Avoid Temptation Than It Is to Resist Temptation
The focus of my message today is based on a proverb from Solomon, who was given a gift from God of "exceeding" wisdom, "and his fame was in all nations round about. . . . And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon."1 Even 3,000 years later, when we read Solomons proverbs we often nod in agreement with his profound wisdom because life has also taught us the same lesson - often through a trying or difficult experience.
If life hasnt yet taught you the wisdom of the proverb I am about to share, it would be my prayer that by the end of my remarks it will have enlightened your understanding and touched your hearts sufficiently to motivate you to make some helpful and wise changes in your life. Here is the proverb: "Enter not into the path of the wicked. . . . Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away." 2The wisdom of Solomon in this passage is to be discovered in the word avoid. Solomon had discovered, as all wise people do, one of lifes most helpful guiding principles: It is easier to avoid temptation than it is to resist temptation.
Chocolate Chip Cookies
To illustrate the wisdom of this principle, lets suppose my great temptation in life is chocolate chip cookies and Im trying to conquer the temptation. It is easier for me not to have the cookies in the house than it is to walk through the front door and smell two dozen of them fresh out of the oven - warm, moist, and smelling good. At that moment I am no longer simply fighting temptation; I am also fighting chemistry. The aroma triggers the pleasure center of my brain. My mouth begins to water in preparation for the cookies. With each tempting breath my resistance grows weaker as my craving grows stronger and my appetite begins to overpower my reason and resolve.
My other self - the one that is carnal3 - argues in favor of the cookies: "You know, dieting doesnt have to mean deprivation. Its your overall effort that counts, and one cookie certainly isnt going to blow your diet." With my pleasure center activated, I dont need much convincing, and I yield to the cookies enticing aroma.
How easy is it to stop when that first cookie only intensified your appetite rather than satisfied it? That same voice says, "Well, youve blown it now! You may as well enjoy yourself and recommit to your diet tomorrow." So after Ive eaten about six cookies, maybe with a glass of milk, I begin to feel remorseful about breaking my resolution and diet.
Hormones, Intimacy, and Families
I hope you will understand the metaphor as I now apply it to a far stronger desire. The Lord has blessed each of us with powerful hormones that also link to the brains pleasure center. It is a very desirable attr</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Since I received this assignment from the First Presidency, I have read carefully the theme and pondered and prayed. I have reviewed the catalog listing more than 1,000 classes and the names of the instructors. There is a good feeling to all of it. I have come this morning to teach.
When we presided over the New England Mission, we lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Across the street lived Dr. Carl J. Friedrich, a retired Harvard professor, a world renowned scholar. We sent our boys over to clear their sidewalk of snow. That opened contact with them. When my wifes parents came to visit at Christmas, the Friedrichs invited us over for the lighting of their Christmas tree, an old-fashioned tree with wax candles alit. It was a very beautiful experience.
While visiting one day with Dr. Friedrich, he told me of his academic degrees from European universities. He became very agitated and said it really irritated him when people asked what he was going to do with all the knowledge he had gained. He answered sharply, "Why should I have to do anything with it?"
Well, I know that you have something to do with the knowledge that you will gain in this great Education Week for yourself, for your family, and for the Church. You are learning much at this great conference.
I do not know who wrote these very meaningful lines, but I think they apply today:
Suppose that we state as a tenet of wisdom
That knowledge is not for delight of the mind,
Nor an end in itself, but a packet of treasure
To hold and employ for the good of mankind.
A torch or a candle is barren of meaning
Except it give light to men as they climb,
And theses and tomes are but impotent jumble
Unless they are tools in the building of time.
. . .
And truly our tireless and endless researches
Need yoking with mans daily problems and strife,
For truth and beauty and virtue have value
Confirmed by their uses in practical life.1
I feel the best possible use of what you are learning at this BYU Education Week will be for your family.
The House Finches and the Serpents
The back windows of our home overlook a small flower garden and the woods which border Little Cottonwood Creek. The north side of the garden is the gable end of another part of the house. Except for a large window in the middle, this wall is thickly covered with English ivy.
Every year this ivy has been the nesting place for house finches. They are small birds dressed as drably as sparrows except in the springtime, when the male puts on a bright red cap and neckerchief as his costume for the serenading that he will do during the nesting season. The male house finch is one of the best soloists in the bird world. The nests in the vines are safe from the foxes and raccoons and ca</span>

Our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has said, "We live in a world where knowledge is developing at an ever-accelerating rate. Drink deeply from this ever-springing well of wisdom and human experience."2
My dear friends, these schooling years pass quickly. I can attest to that fact. Having the wonderful opportunity to be in your midst often gives me many opportunities reminiscent of my university experiences. They seem like a long time ago, but the time between then and now seems to have just whizzed by so rapidly.
Your education is the road to many wonderful opportunities. This is a defining and refining time of your lives. Plato said, "The direction in which education starts a man [or woman], will determine his [or her] future life."3 Your Brigham Young University education can bless your lives as well as those of your immediate family, descendants, church, and community. My experiences in university life - now and in the past - have influenced my life in so many different ways. Yours will do likewise. It is also true that friendships made at these times will last a lifetime.
About four months ago my husband and I were having dinner with such friends. I noticed that above an archway in their home they had placed some printed words. They were in Latin, and I did not know what they meant. These were the words: "Et si omnes ego non."
I was curious as to what they meant and why they had them in such a prominent place in their home. I was told that their translation was, roughly: "Even if all, not I." In other words, "Even if everybody does it, I will not." They proceeded to explain to me that the saying was the motto of the Barons von Boeselager, an old German noble family. Two descendants in the family, Philipp and Georg von Boeselager, were members of the resistance group that had planned the failed assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler on July 20, 1944. Their involvement in the operation went undetected, and they were not executed along with the majority of the other conspirators. The saying is carved in a timber beam on the outside of Philipps family home in Germany.4
Our friends explained that they used this quote as a motto for their family and that it was a reminder to them that they are members of a chosen generation and must be different in the world of today. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they should make choices consistent with the teachings of the gospel and shun the negative, misleading, and evil messages of the world that surround them.
How many of you can remember when y</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You have assembled here on the Brigham Young University campus and at many other locations around the world in anticipation of hearing from Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. I am sorry to disappoint you. Elder Ballard is unable to be with you, and I am honored to have been asked to substitute for him. He wishes he were here, and I can assure you that I wish he were here as well. Again, I am honored to have been asked to substitute for him.
Exactly 50 years ago this very night, I was aboard an enormous and beautiful ocean liner approaching the docks of Southampton, England. I was about to commence my service as a missionary in the British Mission. At that time missionaries traveled to their foreign fields of labor by sea rather than by air. I do believe that Orville and Wilbur Wright had made their first flight by then, but it was still a long time ago.
I want you to know that I loved my mission. It meant so very much to me then and has continued through the years to be the symbol of so many things that are good in this life. The solidifying of my testimony was one of the greatest blessings of my mission. I had what I considered to be a strong testimony before I was called to serve, but teaching and testifying of divine truth caused that testimony to swell within my heart and soul in a way as to sustain me through any trial or challenging situation. I dont know what I would do without the gospel. I will be forever grateful for my mission, for my testimony, and for the shield of protection I have felt through my faith in the Savior. That shield of faith has been my spiritual and moral protection through the years.
Faith in Jesus Christ, Our Best Defense Against Temptation
That thought leads me to the central idea that I would like to leave with you tonight. In the Book of Mormon we read of Almas counsel and instruction to his son Helaman. Among other things, he admonished Helaman to "teach [the people] an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity." He urged him to "preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ." And now listen to these words. Alma said, "Teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Alma 37:3233). Do you see and sense the meaning and the power in that for you - indeed, for all of us?
Alma continued his instruction to Helaman, saying:
Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.
O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God. . . .
Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good. [Alma 37:3435, 37]
This is marvelous and appropriate counsel for all of us, young or old.
The very best and most certain defense we have against the temptations of the devi</span>
