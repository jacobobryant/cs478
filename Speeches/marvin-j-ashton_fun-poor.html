  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I think, when I announce the title of my remarks, it is reasonable to assume many of you could nudge the one next to you and say, "So what else is new?" or "I know that is true. Where does the line form for those to stand who want to bear witness to the fact?"

Well, with just that much to arouse your interest, my topic is, "Its No Fun Being Poor."

Despite some thoughts to the contrary, the great majority in attendance today are not poor. However, we can become victims of real poverty if we are not wise in our daily conduct. Fortunately, very few in attendance today are poor. The main question for every person to resolve is not what he would do if he had unlimited money, time, influence, or vast educational advantages, but how he will best use the means and assets he has and will yet have.

The purpose of my remarks is to try to help all of us avoid being poor. I hope that, if we are already poor, we will be wise enough to overcome it with corrective actions prompted by self-motivation. Brigham Young University does not exist to help you make money. It exists to make you rich.

"Its no fun being poor." Here are some truths for your consideration. I am going to identify them as ten commandments we should follow if we would avoid being poor. Doubtless there may be 10, 20, or 30 more, but for our purposes today, the following may be construed as perhaps a good start.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;I. Thou shalt not lose a friend or cease being one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A person is poor when his friendship inventory is depreciating. A person is poor when he is friendless. When friends, those closest to us, have cause to desert, to disbelieve, to lose confidence in us, we are poor. Very often friends are lost because we are unwilling to pay the price it takes to maintain them. It was Emerson who said, "The only way to have a friend is to be one" ("Friendship," &lt;i&gt;Essays&lt;/i&gt;). A friend is a person who will not only take the time to know us, but also take the time to be with us, and never leave us regardless of the circumstances. One of the finest presents each of us can give someone else is our best self. When we lose friends, our strength as well as our desire is ofttimes totally drained. In our personal balance sheets "minus friends" indicates a loss position. No man is useless while he has a friend. No man can declare personal bankruptcy if he has one friend.

Joseph Smith gave us a glimpse of his measure of friends when he said, "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself" (&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 6:549). The Savior said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).

When Robert Louis Stevenson was asked the secret of his radiant, useful life, he responded simply, "I had a friend."

A friend in the true sense is not a person who passively nods approval of our conduct or encourages improper behavior. A friend is a person who cares. When we lose someone who cares about us, we lose one of our most valuable assets. An Arabian proverb helps us:

&lt;i&gt;A friend is one to whom one may pour out all the contents of ones heart, chaff and grain together, knowing that the gentlest of hands will take and sift it, keep what is worth keeping, and with the breath of kindness blow the rest away.&lt;/i&gt;

A friend is a priceless possession because a true friend is one who is willing to take us the way we are but is able to leave us better than he found us. We are poor when we lose friends because generally they are willing to reprove, admonish, love, encourage, and guide for our best good. A friend lifts the heavy heart, says the encouraging word, and assists in supplying our daily needs. As friends we will make ourselves available without delay to those who need us.

It is hoped that in the days ahead more and more of us will free ourselves from expressions of, "If you need me, let me know," or, "If I can be of help, call me," and replace them with the development of a sixth sense that will let us know when and where our friendship is needed.

When Joseph Smith was in the Liberty Jail, he poured out his heart and soul with, "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1).

Part of Gods great declaration of love and encouragement to him at that time was,

&lt;i&gt;My son, . . . thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job&lt;/i&gt;. [D&amp;amp;C 121:7, 9, 10]

Joseph Smith was enduring much for Gods own purposes, but he was rich because his friends were standing by him. A person is poor when he is friendless, but even poorer when he ceases being a friend. No matter what the conduct or negligence of others may be, we cannot afford to yield in our sincere pursuit to be a friend. When a person allows himself to feel he has no friends, he is poor; but he is doubly poor if he has to admit he is a friend to no one. Very often our family members and friends need our friendship most when they least deserve it.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;II. Thou shalt honor thy character and protect it from self-destruction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A person is poor when his character is honeycombed with greed and warped by dishonesty. When we yield to misconduct under pressure, we are poor. A person who has to beg for bread is not poor if he has not bent to expediency. An individual is headed for personal bankruptcy when he sells his character and reputation for cash, honor, or convenience. We are poor in character when we think getting by is a substitute for doing our best. Virtue, action, and truth properly blended in life make a person rich. Our character is determined by how we perform in meeting lifes challenges. Thank God for students, faculty, and administration who have the courage to stand up and be counted on the side of truth and integrity. What a compliment it is to have someone say of you, "She will not yield her principles under pressure or distress."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;III. Thou shalt not deceive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Sir Walter Scott said:

&lt;i&gt;Oh, what a tangled web we weave,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When first we practice to deceive!&lt;/i&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;Marmion&lt;/i&gt;, canto 6, stanza 17]

A man of character considers what is right. A man of deceit considers, "What will partial truths bring me when I crowd the line of truth?"

&lt;i&gt;And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 124:15]

A favorite tool of the devil is deception. He would have us all become poor by living and promoting the lie. Whenever deception is encouraged, the promoter is the greatest loser. He must bear the responsibility for those he injures. Satans skills win him the title of "the father of deceit."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;IV. Thou shalt not compromise thy principles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Students and others should constantly remind themselves that character is education properly applied. The sharing and encouraging of truth on a continuing basis shelters one from poverty. Nobility in character is one asset that will bring dividends regardless of the business climate. A quality person will not compromise his principles regardless of the size or intensity of the foe or the situation. A person who compromises in a sense advertises in the marketplace that a certain price or consideration will cause him to sell out. People of uncompromising principles are never poor. How rich are those who can live by worthy principles and manage the results!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;V. Thou shalt love thyself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Through an appropriate blend of self-pride and self-dignity, self-respect will surface. A person is poor when he personally labels himself as a "marked down" or a "close out" article.

A person is poor when he loses self-dignity, self-respect, and self-pride. How sad, how long the day when we become low on ourselves! The worst form of defeat is to be conquered by self. Defeat is not pleasant, but nothing is so painful and devastating as self-defeat. When we lose our self-dignity and self-respect, it is the worst form of poverty. When trust in friends and self are both lost, there is not much left in life. We should teach, particularly ourselves, that nobody is a nobody. We are someone, and with Gods help we can accomplish all things. It is a sad day when a person finds it easier to be true to friends than to himself.How unwise, how unfair to sell ourselves short when God is our partner! Personal bankruptcy is impossible for a person of self-pride. A person is poor when he places despair over hope. A person is poor when he fails to remember who he really is and forgets his relationship to God, family, and self.

Many years ago on a hot summer day I was walking through the medium security division of the Utah State Prison. Most inmates were out of their cells. I mingled among them and visited with some. Most were dressed without shirts. I remember as though it were yesterday my talking to one who had tattooed across his chest in rather large letters "A Born Loser."

What self-pride, self-dignity, and self-respect! He had labeled himself poor, and his present environment indicated he was doing quite well with his personal image.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;VI. Thou shalt be honest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A person is poor when he thinks honesty is a policy instead of a proper way of life.Thomas Carlyle said, "Over the times thou hast no power, solely over one man thou hast quite absolute power. Him redeem and make honest." An honest conscience is worth more than it costs. Greatness is truly measured by honest self-appraisal. "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). How many times over the years have you heard the declaration that it is greater to be trusted than to be loved? Let me remind you that, regardless of the number of times, you havent heard it enough. One of my greatest pleadings with the Lord on a daily basis is for Him to help me turn the hearts of the dishonest to repentance. Without honesty there is no foundation upon which to build. How can a person be helped when he insists on living the lie? Lying and living the lie keep us poor.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;VII. Thou shalt not wrongfully exploit others for personal advantage.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A person is poor when he drops or uses the name of an individual or an institution to promote or sell his questionable wares. How unfair, unwise, and poor are those who would have us believe a "get rich" investment opportunity is desirable because of the ecclesiastical office the one holds who is making the proposition. Any person who allows his good name or image to be used to promote or encourage schemes of the unscrupulous is embracing dishonesty. A lie (dishonesty) is any communication given to another with the intent to deceive. An improper entry in ones personal ledger, flattery, failure to defend a truth or principle, failure to discipline, and the endorsement of a fallacy are a few of the other forms of exploiting for personal gain.

In todays marketplace - yes, in your own neighborhood, town, and cities - scheming, deceiving promoters are making available to gullible purchasers, including faculty and students, all kinds of enticing offers. We are sorry to report thousands within our ranks are being duped by the glib tongues of those who offer and solicit in whispers "once in a lifetime opportunities" and "just for you" approaches.

Those of us who give glib "pie in the sky" promoters even the time of day are moving in the direction of the classification of being poor.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;VIII. Thou shalt not believe repentance is an announcement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A person is poor when he lives by comparison rather than by principle. A person is poor when he fails to realize repentance is a process and not just a declaration. Every person has the challenge of recognizing and carrying his personal cross, and then going forth. Repentance is an action principle, not a self-declared holding pattern.

A person who is willing to repent will never have more liabilities than assets. Repentance makes it possible for the sinner to get back up when he falls. True repentance doesnt allow a person to stay poor.

When important happenings and decisions in life come our way and we feel we are at the very valley in our lifes travels, we always have the choice of either repenting or rebelling. A person is poor only when he is unwilling to use and understand repentance. Repentance is a major stepping-stone in becoming rich. Repentance is not an announcement. It is improved conduct.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;IX. Thou shalt not stay poor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Its not fun being poor, but no one has to be. With friends, virtue, character, truth, integrity, repentance, and other God-given gifts and rights available, pearls of great price are ours for the seeking. Through prayer and action God helps us avoid being poor. He that has eternal life in its fulness is rich. Its no fun being poor. It is much more fun to be rich. We can be rich if lifes ledger is filled with daily entries that show bottom-line totals including sound moral conduct, uprightness, and incorruptibility.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;X. Thou shalt not allow thyself to be managed by money.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Remember the financially well-to-do are poor only when they allow their money to manage them instead of their managing their money.

There is one other very important ingredient for consideration when we talk about "Its No Fun Being Poor." Following the type of thinking I have promoted today, it would not be unusual - in fact, I think it would be quite likely - that, for example, four students who live in a dormitory together could experience this. One could be a little cynical or sarcastic, and, upon opening a cupboard door and looking inside at some of the bare shelves, say, "Dont forget, were rich." Another might look in the refrigerator and freezer and, upon noting there is more cold than food, could say, "Dont forget, were not poor; it just looks like we are!" Someone else who is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that she is entitled to a new dress or outfit after a long delay, but cant have them because of a lack of funds could murmur, "I must remember Im rich."

A person who allows his money to manage him instead of his managing his money is poor. No matter how much or how little we have to live on each week or month, it needs to be used wisely. We need to work out a budget and live within it. Some claim living within a budget takes the fun out of life and is too restrictive. Those who avoid the inconvenience of budget regulations must suffer the pains of living outside it. Your Church operates within a budget. Brigham Young University functions within a budget. Each department in the school has a budget. The president of the university lives within a budget. Budget guidelines encourage better performance and management. It seems there will always be emergencies and crises in all of our lives that cause financial drain, but even these developments need not make us poor. Having friends, family, neighbors, bishops, stake presidents who care and share makes us rich. Financial disaster can be avoided if we learn with others how to help ourselves. Things generally turn up for those who keep digging. Through work, education, and commitment, personal satisfaction can be realized as we make appropriate use of the accumulation of this worlds goods. No one needs to apologize for his success in financial achievement if the means of attainment have been honorable, and he knows how to wisely use what he has.

Conversely, when money and wealth become our goal and our god, we are poor. I personally applaud those who are honorably successful in achieving an abundance of this worlds goods, but only if it is convincingly evident their money is being wisely used. I could hope and pray that in the future there will be more and more good men and women committed to having more of their money put to use helping some student and less in personal financial assets. No man should be respected just for his riches, but rather by his philanthropy. We do not judge the value of the sun by its height, but for its usefulness.

It is a worthy prayer to ask our Heavenly Father to bless us with this worlds goods, but not with more than we can bear. Too much money can make us poor. Limited budgets can teach us sacrifice, self-reliance, restraint, and personal management. One of lifes great lessons is to teach us that what we do with what we have is more important than what we have. Proper incentive and attitudes prevent us from ever classifying ourselves as poor.

I leave you these thoughts, my love, and my testimony. Its no fun being poor. Fortunately, none of us has to be. To this truth I leave my solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>I think, when I announce the title of my remarks, it is reasonable to assume many of you could nudge the one next to you and say, "So what else is new?" or "I know that is true. Where does the line form for those to stand who want to bear witness to the fact?"</p>
<p>Well, with just that much to arouse your interest, my topic is, "Its No Fun Being Poor."</p>
<p>Despite some thoughts to the contrary, the great majority in attendance today are not poor. However, we can become victims of real poverty if we are not wise in our daily conduct. Fortunately, very few in attendance today are poor. The main question for every person to resolve is not what he would do if he had unlimited money, time, influence, or vast educational advantages, but how he will best use the means and assets he has and will yet have.</p>
<p>The purpose of my remarks is to try to help all of us avoid being poor. I hope that, if we are already poor, we will be wise enough to overcome it with corrective actions prompted by self-motivation. Brigham Young University does not exist to help you make money. It exists to make you rich.</p>
<p>"Its no fun being poor." Here are some truths for your consideration. I am going to identify them as ten commandments we should follow if we would avoid being poor. Doubtless there may be 10, 20, or 30 more, but for our purposes today, the following may be construed as perhaps a good start.</p>
<h2><b>I. Thou shalt not lose a friend or cease being one.</b></h2>
<p>A person is poor when his friendship inventory is depreciating. A person is poor when he is friendless. When friends, those closest to us, have cause to desert, to disbelieve, to lose confidence in us, we are poor. Very often friends are lost because we are unwilling to pay the price it takes to maintain them. It was Emerson who said, "The only way to have a friend is to be one" ("Friendship," <i>Essays</i>). A friend is a person who will not only take the time to know us, but also take the time to be with us, and never leave us regardless of the circumstances. One of the finest presents each of us can give someone else is our best self. When we lose friends, our strength as well as our desire is ofttimes totally drained. In our personal balance sheets "minus friends" indicates a loss position. No man is useless while he has a friend. No man can declare personal bankruptcy if he has one friend.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith gave us a glimpse of his measure of friends when he said, "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself" (<i>HC</i> 6:549). The Savior said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).</p>
<p>When Robert Louis Stevenson was asked the secret of his radiant, useful life, he responded simply, "I had a friend."</p>
<p>A friend in the true sense is not a person who passively nods approval of our conduct or encourages improper behavior. A friend is a person who cares. When we lose someone who cares about us, we lose one of our most valuable assets. An Arabian proverb helps us:</p>
<p><i>A friend is one to whom one may pour out all the contents of ones heart, chaff and grain together, knowing that the gentlest of hands will take and sift it, keep what is worth keeping, and with the breath of kindness blow the rest away.</i></p>
<p>A friend is a priceless possession because a true friend is one who is willing to take us the way we are but is able to leave us better than he found us. We are poor when we lose friends because generally they are willing to reprove, admonish, love, encourage, and guide for our best good. A friend lifts the heavy heart, says the encouraging word, and assists in supplying our daily needs. As friends we will make ourselves available without delay to those who need us.</p>
<p>It is hoped that in the days ahead more and more of us will free ourselves from expressions of, "If you need me, let me know," or, "If I can be of help, call me," and replace them with the development of a sixth sense that will let us know when and where our friendship is needed.</p>
<p>When Joseph Smith was in the Liberty Jail, he poured out his heart and soul with, "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;C 121:1).</p>
<p>Part of Gods great declaration of love and encouragement to him at that time was,</p>
<p><i>My son, . . . thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.</i></p>
<p><i>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job</i>. [D&amp;C 121:7, 9, 10]</p>
<p>Joseph Smith was enduring much for Gods own purposes, but he was rich because his friends were standing by him. A person is poor when he is friendless, but even poorer when he ceases being a friend. No matter what the conduct or negligence of others may be, we cannot afford to yield in our sincere pursuit to be a friend. When a person allows himself to feel he has no friends, he is poor; but he is doubly poor if he has to admit he is a friend to no one. Very often our family members and friends need our friendship most when they least deserve it.</p>
<h2><b>II. Thou shalt honor thy character and protect it from self-destruction.</b></h2>
<p>A person is poor when his character is honeycombed with greed and warped by dishonesty. When we yield to misconduct under pressure, we are poor. A person who has to beg for bread is not poor if he has not bent to expediency. An individual is headed for personal bankruptcy when he sells his character and reputation for cash, honor, or convenience. We are poor in character when we think getting by is a substitute for doing our best. Virtue, action, and truth properly blended in life make a person rich. Our character is determined by how we perform in meeting lifes challenges. Thank God for students, faculty, and administration who have the courage to stand up and be counted on the side of truth and integrity. What a compliment it is to have someone say of you, "She will not yield her principles under pressure or distress."</p>
<h2><b>III. Thou shalt not deceive.</b></h2>
<p>Sir Walter Scott said:</p>
<p><i>Oh, what a tangled web we weave,</i><br />
<i>When first we practice to deceive!</i><br />
[<i>Marmion</i>, canto 6, stanza 17]</p>
<p>A man of character considers what is right. A man of deceit considers, "What will partial truths bring me when I crowd the line of truth?"</p>
<p><i>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord. </i>[D&amp;C 124:15]</p>
<p>A favorite tool of the devil is deception. He would have us all become poor by living and promoting the lie. Whenever deception is encouraged, the promoter is the greatest loser. He must bear the responsibility for those he injures. Satans skills win him the title of "the father of deceit."</p>
<h2><b>IV. Thou shalt not compromise thy principles.</b></h2>
<p>Students and others should constantly remind themselves that character is education properly applied. The sharing and encouraging of truth on a continuing basis shelters one from poverty. Nobility in character is one asset that will bring dividends regardless of the business climate. A quality person will not compromise his principles regardless of the size or intensity of the foe or the situation. A person who compromises in a sense advertises in the marketplace that a certain price or consideration will cause him to sell out. People of uncompromising principles are never poor. How rich are those who can live by worthy principles and manage the results!</p>
<h2><b>V. Thou shalt love thyself.</b></h2>
<p>Through an appropriate blend of self-pride and self-dignity, self-respect will surface. A person is poor when he personally labels himself as a "marked down" or a "close out" article.</p>
<p>A person is poor when he loses self-dignity, self-respect, and self-pride. How sad, how long the day when we become low on ourselves! The worst form of defeat is to be conquered by self. Defeat is not pleasant, but nothing is so painful and devastating as self-defeat. When we lose our self-dignity and self-respect, it is the worst form of poverty. When trust in friends and self are both lost, there is not much left in life. We should teach, particularly ourselves, that nobody is a nobody. We are someone, and with Gods help we can accomplish all things. It is a sad day when a person finds it easier to be true to friends than to himself.How unwise, how unfair to sell ourselves short when God is our partner! Personal bankruptcy is impossible for a person of self-pride. A person is poor when he places despair over hope. A person is poor when he fails to remember who he really is and forgets his relationship to God, family, and self.</p>
<p>Many years ago on a hot summer day I was walking through the medium security division of the Utah State Prison. Most inmates were out of their cells. I mingled among them and visited with some. Most were dressed without shirts. I remember as though it were yesterday my talking to one who had tattooed across his chest in rather large letters "A Born Loser."</p>
<p>What self-pride, self-dignity, and self-respect! He had labeled himself poor, and his present environment indicated he was doing quite well with his personal image.</p>
<h2><b>VI. Thou shalt be honest.</b></h2>
<p>A person is poor when he thinks honesty is a policy instead of a proper way of life.Thomas Carlyle said, "Over the times thou hast no power, solely over one man thou hast quite absolute power. Him redeem and make honest." An honest conscience is worth more than it costs. Greatness is truly measured by honest self-appraisal. "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). How many times over the years have you heard the declaration that it is greater to be trusted than to be loved? Let me remind you that, regardless of the number of times, you havent heard it enough. One of my greatest pleadings with the Lord on a daily basis is for Him to help me turn the hearts of the dishonest to repentance. Without honesty there is no foundation upon which to build. How can a person be helped when he insists on living the lie? Lying and living the lie keep us poor.</p>
<h2><b>VII. Thou shalt not wrongfully exploit others for personal advantage.</b></h2>
<p>A person is poor when he drops or uses the name of an individual or an institution to promote or sell his questionable wares. How unfair, unwise, and poor are those who would have us believe a "get rich" investment opportunity is desirable because of the ecclesiastical office the one holds who is making the proposition. Any person who allows his good name or image to be used to promote or encourage schemes of the unscrupulous is embracing dishonesty. A lie (dishonesty) is any communication given to another with the intent to deceive. An improper entry in ones personal ledger, flattery, failure to defend a truth or principle, failure to discipline, and the endorsement of a fallacy are a few of the other forms of exploiting for personal gain.</p>
<p>In todays marketplace - yes, in your own neighborhood, town, and cities - scheming, deceiving promoters are making available to gullible purchasers, including faculty and students, all kinds of enticing offers. We are sorry to report thousands within our ranks are being duped by the glib tongues of those who offer and solicit in whispers "once in a lifetime opportunities" and "just for you" approaches.</p>
<p>Those of us who give glib "pie in the sky" promoters even the time of day are moving in the direction of the classification of being poor.</p>
<h2><b>VIII. Thou shalt not believe repentance is an announcement.</b></h2>
<p>A person is poor when he lives by comparison rather than by principle. A person is poor when he fails to realize repentance is a process and not just a declaration. Every person has the challenge of recognizing and carrying his personal cross, and then going forth. Repentance is an action principle, not a self-declared holding pattern.</p>
<p>A person who is willing to repent will never have more liabilities than assets. Repentance makes it possible for the sinner to get back up when he falls. True repentance doesnt allow a person to stay poor.</p>
<p>When important happenings and decisions in life come our way and we feel we are at the very valley in our lifes travels, we always have the choice of either repenting or rebelling. A person is poor only when he is unwilling to use and understand repentance. Repentance is a major stepping-stone in becoming rich. Repentance is not an announcement. It is improved conduct.</p>
<h2><b>IX. Thou shalt not stay poor.</b></h2>
<p>Its not fun being poor, but no one has to be. With friends, virtue, character, truth, integrity, repentance, and other God-given gifts and rights available, pearls of great price are ours for the seeking. Through prayer and action God helps us avoid being poor. He that has eternal life in its fulness is rich. Its no fun being poor. It is much more fun to be rich. We can be rich if lifes ledger is filled with daily entries that show bottom-line totals including sound moral conduct, uprightness, and incorruptibility.</p>
<h2><b>X. Thou shalt not allow thyself to be managed by money.</b></h2>
<p>Remember the financially well-to-do are poor only when they allow their money to manage them instead of their managing their money.</p>
<p>There is one other very important ingredient for consideration when we talk about "Its No Fun Being Poor." Following the type of thinking I have promoted today, it would not be unusual - in fact, I think it would be quite likely - that, for example, four students who live in a dormitory together could experience this. One could be a little cynical or sarcastic, and, upon opening a cupboard door and looking inside at some of the bare shelves, say, "Dont forget, were rich." Another might look in the refrigerator and freezer and, upon noting there is more cold than food, could say, "Dont forget, were not poor; it just looks like we are!" Someone else who is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that she is entitled to a new dress or outfit after a long delay, but cant have them because of a lack of funds could murmur, "I must remember Im rich."</p>
<p>A person who allows his money to manage him instead of his managing his money is poor. No matter how much or how little we have to live on each week or month, it needs to be used wisely. We need to work out a budget and live within it. Some claim living within a budget takes the fun out of life and is too restrictive. Those who avoid the inconvenience of budget regulations must suffer the pains of living outside it. Your Church operates within a budget. Brigham Young University functions within a budget. Each department in the school has a budget. The president of the university lives within a budget. Budget guidelines encourage better performance and management. It seems there will always be emergencies and crises in all of our lives that cause financial drain, but even these developments need not make us poor. Having friends, family, neighbors, bishops, stake presidents who care and share makes us rich. Financial disaster can be avoided if we learn with others how to help ourselves. Things generally turn up for those who keep digging. Through work, education, and commitment, personal satisfaction can be realized as we make appropriate use of the accumulation of this worlds goods. No one needs to apologize for his success in financial achievement if the means of attainment have been honorable, and he knows how to wisely use what he has.</p>
<p>Conversely, when money and wealth become our goal and our god, we are poor. I personally applaud those who are honorably successful in achieving an abundance of this worlds goods, but only if it is convincingly evident their money is being wisely used. I could hope and pray that in the future there will be more and more good men and women committed to having more of their money put to use helping some student and less in personal financial assets. No man should be respected just for his riches, but rather by his philanthropy. We do not judge the value of the sun by its height, but for its usefulness.</p>
<p>It is a worthy prayer to ask our Heavenly Father to bless us with this worlds goods, but not with more than we can bear. Too much money can make us poor. Limited budgets can teach us sacrifice, self-reliance, restraint, and personal management. One of lifes great lessons is to teach us that what we do with what we have is more important than what we have. Proper incentive and attitudes prevent us from ever classifying ourselves as poor.</p>
<p>I leave you these thoughts, my love, and my testimony. Its no fun being poor. Fortunately, none of us has to be. To this truth I leave my solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am excited to be here today. I pray that the Spirit will bless us. The topic today is important, both temporally and spiritually, and I invite you to listen with both your mind and your heart.
Each year I teach almost a thousand BYU students in SFL (School of Family Life) 260 about family finance. Oddly enough, the purpose of this course is not to teach students how to get rich. Instead, the goal is to help students gain a stewardship perspective and wisely manage their money to joyfully strengthen family relationships. As a bonus, this class fulfills the quantitative reasoning general education requirement.
At the beginning of each semester I tell my class to remember three things, and I invite you to do the same:
First, life is hard, but you can do hard things. With the help of the Lord you can do anything He wants you to do - even balance a budget or invest in a mutual fund.
Second, when life doesnt go as planned, dont get frustrated; make the best of it. Most of the time things dont go as planned - especially in financial matters - and if you dont make the best of it, you will spend most of your life feeling frustrated.
And third, remember TTT: things take time. In fact, the best financial plan is the "get rich slowly" plan in which you safely and systematically invest.
Whenever I talk about finances, I am reminded of a story I heard about a college freshman who didnt budget very well. He kept running out of money before he ran out of month.
One night the student texted home: "No mon, no fun, your son."
His wise father texted right back: "How sad, too bad, your dad."1
I hope my talk this morning will help you avoid the plight of this student.
The title of this devotional is "Money Matters: Living Joyfully Within Your Means." To introduce this theme, I would like to get personal and briefly share some things I have learned over my lifetime about money and joyful living.
A long, long time ago, Juanita Ray and I met while attending BYU. We played racquetball together, courted for a time, and were married in the temple. As newlyweds, we had no money. We lived in a tiny two-room apartment with low ceilings, we bought clothes from Deseret Industries, and we ate her familys food storage. We drank powdered milk for almost a year - yuck! But we had each other, we had our love, and we had the gospel. It was a good year. We learned that you dont need a lot of money to be happy.
I graduated, I got a good job, and we started drinking whole milk - heavenly! I had been taught to pay 10 percent to the Lord, save 10 percent to invest, and live on the rest. Juanita and I did this as we created our family budgets over the years. We were fruitful, and after twenty-five years we had lots of kids who filled our mortgage-free home. We also had solid investments. We learned about the miracle of compo</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is my great pleasure to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. On a personal note, I should tell you that in January of this year my wife, Bertha, and I celebrated the payment of our last tuition bill. Our youngest child, Heather, is with us today as a graduate, and no two people are prouder or happier for her than are we.
As new graduates, many of you may be focusing on the possibilities that lie ahead to create wealth for yourselves. Might I suggest that you consider wealth creation as a commodity made up of financial, human, and intellectual capital. Business people know that they must spend 70 to 80 percent of their time growing assets. In families, growing the human and intellectual assets is often overlooked. The members in the family are the human capital. Their collective life experiences and knowledge make up the intellectual capital. The financial capital supports the growth of the other two. James E. Hughes, Jr., suggests these concepts to us in his book, Family Wealth.
He reminds us that
in the mid-eighteenth century, Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded the House of Rothschild. This creator of the Rothschild fortune had five sons, each of whom he set up in the banking business in one of the eras five principal European financial capitals: Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Paris, and Naples. He lent them the money to get started at lower than normal interest with the proviso that they pay him back. He directed that each son keep the profits of his individual bank once the original loan had been repaid. He also charged interest in the form of intellectual currency. He requested each of his sons relay to him every bit of financial information he gained in his city. He agreed to share this intellectual interest with his other sons. In modern terms, he created an effective information network.
Mayer Amschel Rothschild also used a powerful investment technique to manage the risk to his familys human capital. By sending each son to a different city, he diversified his human assets into five separate investments, thereby increasing the probability that at least one of the branches would survive political and economic risks. Ultimately, only the London and Paris branches survived and continue to prosper. Today, some 250 years later, the name Rothschild is synonymous with wealth. [James E. Hughes, Jr., Family Wealth: Keeping It in the Family: How Family Members and Their Advisers Preserve Human, Intellectual, and Financial Assets for Generations (Princeton: Bloomberg Press, 2004), 32; adapted by permission]
Mayer Amschel Rothschild understood that two important elements of a familys wealth are its human and intellectual capital. He saw to it that all family members were well educated and that they worked. He also provided specialized mentorship opportunities as his sons entered the workforce.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">One of my colleagues recently boasted that he had won his struggle with money and no longer had any desire to be rich. But when I asked him if that meant that he had all the money he wanted, he replied: "Of course not! Id love to have more money; lots more!"
We would all like to have more money. Indeed, our desire for it is so strong that frequently it is the determining factor in some of our most important decisions, including where to go to school, what to study, what career path to follow, where to work and live, and whom to befriend - and sometimes even whom to marry. In the extreme it may induce us to neglect weightier matters or even engage in unethical or illegal conduct. I suspect that is what the Apostle Paul had in mind when he characterized the love of money as "the root of all evil" and observed that those burdened by it (the love of money) "have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows" (1 Timothy 6:10).
Our yearning for more money in large part is fueled by the popular myth - carefully cultivated by the commercial media - that the ability to access high-quality goods and services is the measure of a happy and meaningful life. In that regard, consider the Lexus commercial that concludes with this enticing observation: "Anyone who believes that money cant buy happiness hasnt driven a Lexus."
Because our ability to access more and better goods and services is measured and limited by the amount of money at our disposal, it is not surprising that most of us believe that more money will bring us a greater sense of well-being and personal fulfillment. Of course the fallacy on which that belief is based is that the physical, psychological, and social gratification associated with material abundance is the equivalent of "the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God" (Mosiah 2:41). In the Saviors words, as recorded in Luke 12:15, "A mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
The Savior then vividly illustrated the foolishness of relying on material possessions as a source of happiness with the parable of a farmer who had been blessed with a bumper crop:
And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. [Luke 12:1721]
The plight of this successful but misguided farmer gives new m</span>
