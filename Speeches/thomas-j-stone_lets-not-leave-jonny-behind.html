  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Good afternoon, honored trustees, distinguished guests, family, friends, and, most important, my fellow BYU graduating class of 2017! It is truly an honor to share this day with you all.

Attending BYU has been a privilege and has taught us many practical lessons that will guide us in the coming years. One such lesson is to never give up, which we learned from our daily ascent up the Richards Building stairs or perhaps from watching the City of Provo as it meticulously paves - and repaves - every street in town. Another lesson we have learned is to obey with exactness, which the BYU parking police have so gently taught us over the years. Finally, taking classes in the winding Jesse Knight Building has prepared us to navigate our way through the ambiguous, multidimensional parts of our lives.

Above all, our time at BYU has taught us to lift and serve others. I witnessed one such act of service this past September when I flew to Cozumel, Mexico, as a member of Team USA to compete in the ITU Triathlon Age-Group World Championships. While I was there, all three medalists from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games competed for the $30,000 grand prize in the mens elite category. Two of the triathletes, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, were brothers from Great Britain who had won the gold and silver medals in the triathlon at the 2016 Olympics.

In Cozumel, when the competitors neared the end of the grueling, nearly two-hour race, Jonathan Brownlee held a comfortable lead with his brother, Alistair, trailing him and Henri Schoeman from South Africa close behind. Video footage of the race shows that with 500 meters to go until the finish line, just as the crowd erupted in applause as Jonathan rounded the final corner, the heat began to take its toll upon Jonathans body. All of a sudden Jonathans pace slowed to a stumble, and he collapsed onto a volunteer standing by the sidelines. There was an audible gasp among the spectators.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

When Alistair rounded the final corner, he saw his dangerously dehydrated younger brother unable to finish the race. Without hesitation Alistair ran toward Jonny, threw his dazed brothers arm around his neck, and half-carried him as they ran the last 500 meters side by side. Alistairs deviation cost him a chance at first place, allowing Schoeman to overtake the two and be first to break the tape.

As the brothers approached the finish line, Alistair pushed Jonny across ahead of him, earning them third and second places, respectively.

Alistair was half a kilometer from winning gold as a world champion. Yet rather than race to the end to claim victory for himself, he slowed, picked up his brother, and enabled Jonny to do something he could not do for himself: finish the race.

Reporters swarmed Alistair, incredulous at his noble sacrifice. To their queries he simply replied, "Mum wouldnt have been happy if Id left Jonny behind."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Just as Alistairs mother instilled within him a sense of integrity and moral character, our time at Brigham Young University has taught us how to learn and how to serve.

So here we are - at the starting line. Todays graduation ceremony marks our own plunge into the race of life as college graduates. There will most likely be times in this race when we too will be forced to make the decision between helping someone else or getting ahead. Our brother or sister may not literally drop down in front of us, but there will be, and certainly are, people in our lives right now who feel like they are falling down within.

Just as Alistair sacrificed to stop and help his brother, we can - and should - make sacrifices in our own lives to help those who are struggling along the way. Our diplomas can serve as a reminder that "unto whom much is given much is required,"&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; because some races are simply worth finishing &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt;.

As we graduate and go out into the world, searching for purpose in our careers and our families, let us remember the poignant words of Charles Dickens, who once wrote, "No one is useless in this world . . . who lightens the burden of it for any one else."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

So lets not leave Jonny behind. Lets dare to be kind when others run by. Lets lift those around us without hesitation. I know that if we do so, we will cross the finish line together and make our "mums" proud!

Thank you and congratulations, Class of 2017!

			<p>Good afternoon, honored trustees, distinguished guests, family, friends, and, most important, my fellow BYU graduating class of 2017! It is truly an honor to share this day with you all.</p>
<p>Attending BYU has been a privilege and has taught us many practical lessons that will guide us in the coming years. One such lesson is to never give up, which we learned from our daily ascent up the Richards Building stairs or perhaps from watching the City of Provo as it meticulously paves - and repaves - every street in town. Another lesson we have learned is to obey with exactness, which the BYU parking police have so gently taught us over the years. Finally, taking classes in the winding Jesse Knight Building has prepared us to navigate our way through the ambiguous, multidimensional parts of our lives.</p>
<p>Above all, our time at BYU has taught us to lift and serve others. I witnessed one such act of service this past September when I flew to Cozumel, Mexico, as a member of Team USA to compete in the ITU Triathlon Age-Group World Championships. While I was there, all three medalists from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games competed for the $30,000 grand prize in the mens elite category. Two of the triathletes, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, were brothers from Great Britain who had won the gold and silver medals in the triathlon at the 2016 Olympics.</p>
<p>In Cozumel, when the competitors neared the end of the grueling, nearly two-hour race, Jonathan Brownlee held a comfortable lead with his brother, Alistair, trailing him and Henri Schoeman from South Africa close behind. Video footage of the race shows that with 500 meters to go until the finish line, just as the crowd erupted in applause as Jonathan rounded the final corner, the heat began to take its toll upon Jonathans body. All of a sudden Jonathans pace slowed to a stumble, and he collapsed onto a volunteer standing by the sidelines. There was an audible gasp among the spectators.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>When Alistair rounded the final corner, he saw his dangerously dehydrated younger brother unable to finish the race. Without hesitation Alistair ran toward Jonny, threw his dazed brothers arm around his neck, and half-carried him as they ran the last 500 meters side by side. Alistairs deviation cost him a chance at first place, allowing Schoeman to overtake the two and be first to break the tape.</p>
<p>As the brothers approached the finish line, Alistair pushed Jonny across ahead of him, earning them third and second places, respectively.</p>
<p>Alistair was half a kilometer from winning gold as a world champion. Yet rather than race to the end to claim victory for himself, he slowed, picked up his brother, and enabled Jonny to do something he could not do for himself: finish the race.</p>
<p>Reporters swarmed Alistair, incredulous at his noble sacrifice. To their queries he simply replied, "Mum wouldnt have been happy if Id left Jonny behind."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Just as Alistairs mother instilled within him a sense of integrity and moral character, our time at Brigham Young University has taught us how to learn and how to serve.</p>
<p>So here we are - at the starting line. Todays graduation ceremony marks our own plunge into the race of life as college graduates. There will most likely be times in this race when we too will be forced to make the decision between helping someone else or getting ahead. Our brother or sister may not literally drop down in front of us, but there will be, and certainly are, people in our lives right now who feel like they are falling down within.</p>
<p>Just as Alistair sacrificed to stop and help his brother, we can - and should - make sacrifices in our own lives to help those who are struggling along the way. Our diplomas can serve as a reminder that "unto whom much is given much is required,"<sup>3</sup> because some races are simply worth finishing <i>together</i>.</p>
<p>As we graduate and go out into the world, searching for purpose in our careers and our families, let us remember the poignant words of Charles Dickens, who once wrote, "No one is useless in this world . . . who lightens the burden of it for any one else."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>So lets not leave Jonny behind. Lets dare to be kind when others run by. Lets lift those around us without hesitation. I know that if we do so, we will cross the finish line together and make our "mums" proud!</p>
<p>Thank you and congratulations, Class of 2017!</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You might recall in the beloved Dr. Seuss childrens book Horton Hears a Who! how Horton, who was an elephant, had a chance encounter with a speck of dust, from whence a voice, barely audible, called out for help. Horton recognized that the voice was coming from the speck of dust and proceeded to do all he could to protect and defend this colony of Whos, who were "too small to be seen by an elephants eyes."
Horton perceived that someone was in distress and realized that he could help. Instead of discounting his newly discovered friends, and amidst scoffs and scorn from others, he did all he could to give aid. He had a clear understanding of his ability to rescue and protect the Who colony. Through his actions he demonstrated his ability to give aid, share his light, and serve. As Horton exclaimed, "A persons a person, no matter how small."
Being Grateful
Having just celebrated Thanksgiving this past week, and as we transition from November into the month of December and celebrate the birth of our beloved Savior, it seems particularly natural that gratitude has taken center stage in our minds and in our hearts - as it should. No matter how humble and meager our circumstances, we each have so much to be grateful for.
President Thomas S. Monson said of gratitude:
To express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven. ["The Divine Gift of Gratitude," Ensign, November 2010]
He also said:
We can lift ourselves and others as well when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude. ["Divine Gift"]
Gratitude is an expression of our faith. Negativity most certainly breeds despair, depression, lack of enthusiasm, and critical analysis of that which is most likely not our right to criticize or judge.
Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, in a devotional address on gratitude given at BYU, said:
Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.
. . . Gratitude is a commandment of the Father. ["Live in Thanksgiving Daily," BYU devotional address, 31 October 2000]
Doctrine and Covenants 59:7 reads, "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things."
While it may be more challenging to feel grateful when we are in the throes of trials and disappointments, those are the very times when we need to stop, take a look around, and count and list our blessings one by one. It has not been surprising to me throughout my life how</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, brothers and sisters, for taking time from your busy schedules to be here today. From years of personal experience I know the demands and pressures of attending a large university. How grateful I am that you would step away from your studies or other responsibilities to participate in this devotional. Let me also thank those who provided me with this opportunity to speak.
My wife, Tina, and I returned from Jerusalem in mid-August, after a three-year assignment at BYUs Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. We were blessed to have been in a unique university facility, where we worked closely with administrators, faculty members, staff, volunteer couples, and hundreds of students in a way rarely afforded most people. Let me also thank my lifelong and eternal companion for her constant support in what has been a very intense and very rewarding three years. Her sacrifices were many and her influence on others immense.
Life is often filled with surprises. While I recognize the need we all have to set goals and to have lifelong plans in place, we often find ourselves taking detours. Some of these can be scenic and short lived. Others take us down unforeseen paths. I suppose my speaking to you today is one of those shorter detours.
Let me explain: After three years in the Holy Land, my wife and I decided a change of pace was in order when we returned to Utah. Instead of me going back to my office right away, we would spend time with family, find a home, buy a car or two (we sold our home and cars before moving to Jerusalem), and arrange for a trip to Florida to visit Magnolia, our nine-month-old granddaughter, whom I have never met in person. It was a good plan.
Our first week back could not have gone better. We retreated to my in-laws cabin for some welcome family time, they loaned us a car so that we could get around, and our oldest daughter and her husband graciously took us into their home. Life was good!
Then it happened: two weeks after being back, I received an unexpected invitation to speak today - clearly a deviation from the plan, a few ripples on the calm waters of life. In between finding cars (we have), a home (we closed on it last Friday), and spending time with family, I have quietly been slipping into my office on campus to prepare for this wonderful opportunity. I moved the piles of mail that had accumulated during my absence to one side of my desk and set to work, having determined to say something about the Holy Land.
My first exposure to Jerusalem was in 1984, long before most of you were born. Sister Whitchurch and I had spent a couple of years saving money so that we could participate on a three-week Lands of the Scriptures Workshop offered through LDS Seminaries and Institutes. Our travels took us to Italy, Egypt, and many places throughout the Holy Land. From the minute the plane touched down on the tarmac at the Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Avi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a preface to my remarks today, I wish to declare my faith and testimony. I know that there is a God in heaven. He is our Heavenly Father, and He loves all of His children. He has revealed Himself to the world in these the latter days, and prophets walk the earth today as they did anciently.
God loved us, so he sent his Son,
Christ Jesus, the atoning One,
To show us by the path he trod
The one and only way to God.
["God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son," Hymns, 2002, no. 187]
I rejoice with you today in this good news and in this truth.
"Lonely in the Midst of a Million"
During the past several years my wife, Carol, and I have been fortunate to live with you here in "Happy Valley." I consider this a great blessing for us and our family. But I have discovered that even in Happy Valley there are some among us who are not happy and who yearn for recognition and friendship. I find this odd because we live in an environment of relative tranquility and abundance. During an earlier era of peace and plenty described in the Book of Mormon, it was noted: "And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy" (Helaman 6:3). As we fellowship or befriend others, we can also rejoice with them and have great joy.
I have seen this outcome in many of your lives, but not all. There are lonely people among us, and today I share your concern for such souls. Perhaps you are among the lonely. Surely some of those within your reach sense the emptiness of feeling alone in the world. Moroni had such feelings when he wrote, "I am alone . . . , and I have not friends" (Mormon 8:5). But his world was devoid of Saints. In Provo we are surrounded!
In 1867 Mark Twain visited New York City and reported the following: "[New York] is a splendid desert - a domed and steepled solitude, where the stranger is lonely in the midst of a million of his race" ("Letter from Mark Twain," San Francisco Daily Alta California, 11 August 1867, 1). How sad that lonely souls walked the same streets as thousands of other lonely persons - their potential friends. This is contrary to the way God would have us live. He desires that we be "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens" (Ephesians 2:19).
Today there are still lonely people in New York City as well as throughout the world. Listen to a sampling of their voices:
"I always feel lonely and have no friends."
"Im not important to anyone. Im forgettable. Im boring."
"I am so lonely. . . . Please just talk to me." ["I Am Lonely," experienceproject.com]
Or consider the words of a woman who recently visited a beautiful park. Excited to make new friends that day, she noted:
I passed at least 20 adults, some with children, some with dogs on leashes. The dogs a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My brothers and sisters, I hope you are having a wonderful time while here at BYU during Campus Education Week. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the plan of happiness our Heavenly Father has given to us. There is so much information that I always feel we need to be cautious and wise to ever keep uppermost in our minds the simple doctrine and gospel of Christ. Simply stated, it is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance of sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Sister Ballard and I returned a few days ago from England, where we had the privilege, along with several of the Brethren and their wives, to watch the first-ever presentation of the British Pageant. Some 200 cast members, and several hundred other volunteer members, told the story in song, dance, and the spoken word about the arrival of Elders Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Willard Richards, Joseph Fielding, and a few others who came to establish The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in England.
As I watched that story unfold, it brought great memories flooding back to my mind of my experience sixty-five years ago arriving in England to serve a full-time mission as a young man. And as the story progressed, I was deeply touched by the overwhelming contribution converts in the British Isles, and, of course, some from Scandinavia, made in building up and strengthening The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1837 and even on through to today. These fearless early missionaries, bearers of the priesthood and the message of the Restoration, touched hundreds and later thousands of lives through their testimonies, priesthood blessings, and love for the people of Great Britain. They reaped a great harvest of wonderful converts.
As I watched the pageant, I thought to myself, "How did they do this?" The early Saints did not have any proselytizing systems. They did not have Preach My Gospel. They did not have a Missionary Training Center. They did not have easy ways of transportation. But what they did have was an abiding, deep testimony that Joseph Smith knelt in the presence of the Father and the Son as They appeared to him in 1820 and opened the way of the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Father and the Son gave him the principles of the doctrine of Christ that I have previously mentioned.
As I pondered the miracle of the mission to Great Britain, it seemed to me that the simple gospel truths, powerfully explained by those great apostles of yesteryear, just penetrated the hearts of the people. I was also deeply impressed - in fact, so much so that I changed what I had in mind to share with you today because of the impressions that came to me about the power and the importance of the faith and testimony of the dear women and even the children who joined the Church during that formative era. As I watched and remembered, it was ov</span>
