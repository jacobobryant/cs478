  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you, Vice President Rogers, for your kind introduction. The music was beautiful. Brothers and sisters, honored guests, my esteemed colleagues and staff, and my dear, treasured students: welcome. It is an honor to be speaking to you today.

Many of you were present on January 15 of this year when President Henry B. Eyring gave his address about the trials that people face over a lifetime. He named three:

&lt;i&gt;First: We can feel overcome with pain and sorrow at the death of a loved one.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Second: Each of us will struggle against fierce opposition - some of which comes from dealing with our physical needs and some from enemies.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Third: Each of us who live past the age of accountability will feel the need to escape from the effects of sin. &lt;/i&gt;["The Power of Deliverance," BYU devotional, 15 January 2008]

Every loving parent and every loving adult in this room would like to protect you from the harsh trials that life will present to you, but we know no one who has escaped the difficult vicissitudes of life. We want you to be strong. We want you to know how to manage any difficulty that might come your way. We want you to be resilient when you are faced with lifes trials. How do we help you develop those qualities? We cant and shouldnt make all your choices for you - that will not make you strong. So we give to you what wisdom we have gleaned along our paths through life. My task today is to share with you some of that wisdom.

Over the past 10 years I have been involved in the lives of people who have experienced the death of a loved one. Helping them address the grief and bereavement and adjustments in their lives has been a tender, spiritual, and inspiring experience. As President Eyring noted, we will all have trials. Some of them will be to adjust to the deaths of loved ones in our lives.

David Balks research at Kansas State University reports that 25 percent of college students experienced the death of a family member in the past year and that 30 percent experienced the death of a friend in that same time period (see David E. Balk and Laura C. Vesta, "Psychological Development During Four Years of Bereavement: A Longitudinal Case Study," &lt;i&gt;Death Studies&lt;/i&gt; 22, no. 1 [JanuaryFebruary 1998]: 2341). Mild, moderate, or severe grief can interfere with learning, with interpersonal relationships, and with sleeping, eating, and personal growth. Death is the last taboo of our American society. We can talk about it in the third person, and we can talk about it in movies, textbooks, and literature, but it is still very difficult to talk about it in everyday life. Many people will need a friend or friends during difficult times - theyll need someone they can talk to about the trials they are experiencing.

I have entitled my talk "When upon Lifes Billows: Take a Friend." Many of you are familiar with Johnson Oatman Jr.s hymn "Count Your Blessings." The first verse is:

&lt;i&gt;When upon lifes billows you are tempest-tossed,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Count your many blessings; name them one by one,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.&lt;/i&gt;

[&lt;i&gt;Hymns,&lt;/i&gt; 1985, no. 241]

Friendship is one of the greatest blessings we can have. Our friends provide comfort and counsel. They accept - or at least tolerate - our peculiarities and often laugh spontaneously at our jokes. Most of all, they are really quite forgiving of our imperfections.

A dear friend gave me a bowl decorated with a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson. It says, "A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature" ("Friendship," &lt;i&gt;Essays: First Series&lt;/i&gt; [1841]). In truth, a friend may well be a divine masterpiece. Professionally, I have worked as a college faculty member in psychiatricmental health nursing. I have studied human relationships and health for decades. Research from the past 30 years on social support and health offers strong evidence for a positive relationship between social support and the outcomes of many health-related variables. Friendships, along with kinship or family relationships, are the most researched social relationships. Today I want to focus on friendship.

In particular, I want to talk about four aspects of friendship that I hope will offer some assistance to you throughout your life: (1) make friends, (2) make friends with a wide variety of people, (3) make your spouse your friend, and (4) make Christ your friend.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make Friends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Most of you in this room are young. I hope that you have traversed the rocky road of adolescent friendships and are now ready for mature, reciprocal friendships. Mature relationships are precious. At this time in your lives, developing adult friendships may be complicated by the goal to find "the right one." You are anxious about whether you will ever find your "perfect love," "soul mate," and "lifelong partner." For many of you, one of your goals for your time at BYU is to find a partner. And I am in support of that goal. It will happen for many of you, and it will be a great blessing in your lives.

But in your search for your partner, I hope that you will have time to make friends - good friends, maybe even lifelong friends. You can learn so much from them. Not all friendships become lifelong relationships, but friends can be the connections between all of us. Recently my ward bishop, Robert Merkley, gave one of the most eloquent and spiritual talks I have ever heard about loving one another and about Christs love for us. He exhorted those listening to learn to truly love their brothers and sisters here on earth. I believe the Saviors teaching that we must love one another was pervasive and unlimited. Yes, our most important relationships will and should be those in our families, but friendships outside of our families can be very important and beautiful as well.

There are scriptures that support the importance of good friendships:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Exodus 33:11: "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Samuel 18:1: "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mark 5:19: Christ said to a man whom He had just rid of unclean spirits, "Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John 11:5: "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John 11:11: "These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John 11:35: When Jesus came to the grave where Lazarus lay, "Jesus wept."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John 15:13: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I believe that Jesus friendships were deep, profound, and of great importance to Him.

Friendships take time and attention to develop, although I have observed that the process may not take as much time as you might think. I have seen 15 minutes of honest exchange make deep changes in a life. I know long talks can change lives as well. A friend is kind to you, knows and likes you, and wishes the best for you.

The scriptures talk about loving your neighbor. There may be a difference between a neighbor and a friend, but I dont think anyone would question that the good Samaritan described in Luke 10:2937 was truly a friend to the man from Jericho. You know the story: A man from Jericho fell among thieves and was beaten. A priest and a Levite both passed the wounded man, and neither offered help.

&lt;i&gt;But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.&lt;/i&gt; [Luke 10:3337]

I think there is a very simple test for determining if someone is a good friend. Does your association with that person make you a better person? Does he or she inspire you to be the best that you can be? Does your friendship with that person sustain you during difficult times? Do you desire to make the world a better place for your friend? Do take time to make friends.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make Friends with a Wide Variety of People&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The second point I would like to make is that we should make friends with all different types of people. There is often a great deal of loneliness on a campus this large. While talking to new people may be easy for some, for others it takes an extraordinary effort. Some people are self-conscious and painfully shy. As a mother I was aware of such diversities in my children, who are different from each other in their abilities to make friends. When they were young, two of my children could keep a room of people engaged and entertained, while the other two were quieter in temperament. One ran into the library and hid under a table when asked to read an essay at school. They have all matured now and all have friends, but, most important of all, they are friends to each other.

Even with our similarities, we as humans have many differences. If you are gregarious, take the time to befriend a quieter person - you can learn that quietness and silence are great teachers. If you are on the shy side, make the effort to get to know a few others; someone who is more outgoing could teach you how to speak up and be responsive in a group. Learn from each other.

I have noticed that there are some people who attract a large group of friends. Sometimes they attract more people than they can truly, reasonably spend a lot of time with. Often people who want to be their friend are offended when they do not receive the attention they would like. Dont be offended. Remember: friendships take time and nurturing. There are so many others who would love to have you for a friend and spend time with you. If you take offense that you have been left out or ignored, you will not be ready to see the possibilities for friendships with the people around you.

In &lt;i&gt;The Weight of Glory, &lt;/i&gt;C. S. Lewis wrote:

&lt;i&gt;It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are no&lt;/i&gt; ordinary &lt;i&gt;people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. . . . Your neighbour is the holiest object presented to your senses.&lt;/i&gt; [C. S. Lewis, &lt;i&gt;The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Macmillan, 1949), 1415; emphasis in original]

Make friends with a wide variety of people.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make Your Spouse Your Friend&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third issue regarding friendship that I would like to discuss is that of making your spouse your friend. Some of you may marry someone you have known since you were children together, but most of you will not. You will marry someone you have gotten to know within months, or even a few years, before you marry. While your affection for one another is a good beginning for a strong relationship, it may take more to sustain a lifelong relationship. Hopefully the years will open up a wealth of experiences that you can share. But becoming true friends with each other will take time. Take time to listen to each others concerns, dreams, and interests; plan things together; and support each other as best you can. Include each other in your everyday lives. Learn to appreciate that your spouse is unique and different from you and seek to understand him or her, even if you disagree. Encourage your spouse to develop his or her talents and interests, but also do things you both enjoy together. Again, remember that it takes time to make and keep a friend.

My husband and I have nearly raised our children, and now we have more time to nurture our relationship. Boy, was I clever! I married an amazing person - he gets better and better as I get to know him. I enjoy talking to him, listening to him, and just being with him. We dont agree on everything, but we do agree on the important things. I wish you well in making your spouse your best friend.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make Christ Your Friend&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The last issue I would like to address about friendship is that precious relationship you have with Christ. Some of you may know the song "What a Friend We Have in Jesus," with words by Joseph M. Scriven and music by Charles C. Converse:

&lt;i&gt;What a friend we have in Jesus,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;All our sins and griefs to bear!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;What a privilege to carry&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Everything to God in prayer!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Oh, what peace we often forfeit,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Oh, what needless pain we bear,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;All because we do not carry&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Everything to God in prayer!&lt;/i&gt;

The song implores us to take our grief, our sorrow, and our burdens to the Lord in prayer. He truly is our friend, and we can take our troubles to Him. He can be the friend we need.

Christs atoning sacrifice is the essential cornerstone of our lives:

&lt;i&gt;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&lt;/i&gt; [John 3:16]

Through His atoning sacrifice we are made whole. It is a very unique and transforming experience to know and understand Christs gift to us. Does it change you to know Him? What have you done because you know Him?

When I was a little older than most of you students, I moved to Utah from back East. I had made wonderful girlfriends in Boston, and a group of us moved from Boston to the West. (Weve stayed in contact - many of us are dear friends today.) One of my friends had taken a position as a schoolteacher in Cokeville, Wyoming, and five of us planned a wonderful outing to visit her there for one day in May. We planned to go horseback riding in the afternoon, stay overnight, and return to Salt Lake the next day.

We arrived in the late morning, and within a short while we got into our friends very large Cadillac to drive to the riding stables, which were just over a mountain pass about 45 minutes away. It was cool in the morning, but by the time we left it was warm and pleasant. Some of us were dressed for riding - wearing boots, long pants, and a coat. Others had sneakers and sweaters. The car easily held all six of us.

We began the climb over the pass. As we made a turn, we saw an eagle in the road. It took off and soared in slow, arcing circles. It was a spectacular sight - a great omen for a wonderful day ahead, right? As we climbed higher, snow started to dot the sides of the road. The road started turning to mush, and it was getting harder to go forward. Even though we were still going up, we thought we must have been getting close to our destination. Eventually the car would go no farther - it was so mired in mud that we could not move it forward or backward. We tried everything we could think to do.

Because we were almost there, we got out and started walking toward the stables. We walked for a couple of hours, and it was hard in the muck and snow. We couldnt see any stables, houses, or any kind of shelter, and it was starting to get cold - it even starting snowing. We knew we needed to get back to the car for safety for the night, so we headed back.

By the time we got there, it was dark. We spent the night in the car. The only food we had was a box of cereal and a few candies, but our spirits were still high. We stayed warm by turning the heater on and off, and we tried to sleep, but, as you can imagine, it did not come easily. We prayed simply and earnestly for help and courage to handle the situation.

As the sun came up the next morning, we still couldnt get the car out. One person was only wearing sneakers, and her feet had become red and blistered from all the walking the previous day. She was unable to walk easily or quickly. Another friend stayed with her in the car while four of us started to walk back in the direction we had come.

We had walked for about an hour or two when we came upon two fishermen. They told us that they could not drive us out to the town from where they were because the roads needed to dry before their jeep could get out. They had been camping and had a campfire and food; they generously prepared a wonderful breakfast for us.

A little later, one of the men took the jeep and went in search of our car. He returned with my other two friends, who had started to walk; they were hobbling as they got out of the car. As these men were feeding my friends, one of them heated a pot of water, and after it was warm he had my friends sit down. He took each of my friends feet and washed them, putting some salve on their sores and blisters and socks on their feet. The tender comfort and healing efforts of these two men was in similitude of our Savior. I dont know these men. The only piece of information that I remember was that they worked for the &lt;i&gt;Ogden Standard-Examiner.&lt;/i&gt; A couple of hours later they drove us to my friends house, and we returned to Salt Lake later that day.

As I recall that day, I dont remember being afraid or even worried very much. Three decades later, I remember vividly not the near tragedy but the beautiful image of true compassion - a compassionate man washing the feet of a stranger.

I am very grateful for my wonderful friends. I ask those of you who know Christ, who believe in Christ, and who have faith in Christ to let His example help you be a friend to others. Make a wide variety of friends. Make your spouse your friend. And, without question, make Christ your friend. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Thank you, Vice President Rogers, for your kind introduction. The music was beautiful. Brothers and sisters, honored guests, my esteemed colleagues and staff, and my dear, treasured students: welcome. It is an honor to be speaking to you today.</p>
<p>Many of you were present on January 15 of this year when President Henry B. Eyring gave his address about the trials that people face over a lifetime. He named three:</p>
<p><i>First: We can feel overcome with pain and sorrow at the death of a loved one.</i></p>
<p><i>Second: Each of us will struggle against fierce opposition - some of which comes from dealing with our physical needs and some from enemies.</i></p>
<p><i>Third: Each of us who live past the age of accountability will feel the need to escape from the effects of sin. </i>["The Power of Deliverance," BYU devotional, 15 January 2008]</p>
<p>Every loving parent and every loving adult in this room would like to protect you from the harsh trials that life will present to you, but we know no one who has escaped the difficult vicissitudes of life. We want you to be strong. We want you to know how to manage any difficulty that might come your way. We want you to be resilient when you are faced with lifes trials. How do we help you develop those qualities? We cant and shouldnt make all your choices for you - that will not make you strong. So we give to you what wisdom we have gleaned along our paths through life. My task today is to share with you some of that wisdom.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years I have been involved in the lives of people who have experienced the death of a loved one. Helping them address the grief and bereavement and adjustments in their lives has been a tender, spiritual, and inspiring experience. As President Eyring noted, we will all have trials. Some of them will be to adjust to the deaths of loved ones in our lives.</p>
<p>David Balks research at Kansas State University reports that 25 percent of college students experienced the death of a family member in the past year and that 30 percent experienced the death of a friend in that same time period (see David E. Balk and Laura C. Vesta, "Psychological Development During Four Years of Bereavement: A Longitudinal Case Study," <i>Death Studies</i> 22, no. 1 [JanuaryFebruary 1998]: 2341). Mild, moderate, or severe grief can interfere with learning, with interpersonal relationships, and with sleeping, eating, and personal growth. Death is the last taboo of our American society. We can talk about it in the third person, and we can talk about it in movies, textbooks, and literature, but it is still very difficult to talk about it in everyday life. Many people will need a friend or friends during difficult times - theyll need someone they can talk to about the trials they are experiencing.</p>
<p>I have entitled my talk "When upon Lifes Billows: Take a Friend." Many of you are familiar with Johnson Oatman Jr.s hymn "Count Your Blessings." The first verse is:</p>
<p><i>When upon lifes billows you are tempest-tossed,</i></p>
<p><i>When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,</i></p>
<p><i>Count your many blessings; name them one by one,</i></p>
<p><i>And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</i></p>
<p>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 241]</p>
<p>Friendship is one of the greatest blessings we can have. Our friends provide comfort and counsel. They accept - or at least tolerate - our peculiarities and often laugh spontaneously at our jokes. Most of all, they are really quite forgiving of our imperfections.</p>
<p>A dear friend gave me a bowl decorated with a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson. It says, "A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature" ("Friendship," <i>Essays: First Series</i> [1841]). In truth, a friend may well be a divine masterpiece. Professionally, I have worked as a college faculty member in psychiatricmental health nursing. I have studied human relationships and health for decades. Research from the past 30 years on social support and health offers strong evidence for a positive relationship between social support and the outcomes of many health-related variables. Friendships, along with kinship or family relationships, are the most researched social relationships. Today I want to focus on friendship.</p>
<p>In particular, I want to talk about four aspects of friendship that I hope will offer some assistance to you throughout your life: (1) make friends, (2) make friends with a wide variety of people, (3) make your spouse your friend, and (4) make Christ your friend.</p>
<h2><b>Make Friends</b></h2>
<p>Most of you in this room are young. I hope that you have traversed the rocky road of adolescent friendships and are now ready for mature, reciprocal friendships. Mature relationships are precious. At this time in your lives, developing adult friendships may be complicated by the goal to find "the right one." You are anxious about whether you will ever find your "perfect love," "soul mate," and "lifelong partner." For many of you, one of your goals for your time at BYU is to find a partner. And I am in support of that goal. It will happen for many of you, and it will be a great blessing in your lives.</p>
<p>But in your search for your partner, I hope that you will have time to make friends - good friends, maybe even lifelong friends. You can learn so much from them. Not all friendships become lifelong relationships, but friends can be the connections between all of us. Recently my ward bishop, Robert Merkley, gave one of the most eloquent and spiritual talks I have ever heard about loving one another and about Christs love for us. He exhorted those listening to learn to truly love their brothers and sisters here on earth. I believe the Saviors teaching that we must love one another was pervasive and unlimited. Yes, our most important relationships will and should be those in our families, but friendships outside of our families can be very important and beautiful as well.</p>
<p>There are scriptures that support the importance of good friendships:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exodus 33:11: "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 Samuel 18:1: "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mark 5:19: Christ said to a man whom He had just rid of unclean spirits, "Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>John 11:5: "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>John 11:11: "These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>John 11:35: When Jesus came to the grave where Lazarus lay, "Jesus wept."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>John 15:13: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that Jesus friendships were deep, profound, and of great importance to Him.</p>
<p>Friendships take time and attention to develop, although I have observed that the process may not take as much time as you might think. I have seen 15 minutes of honest exchange make deep changes in a life. I know long talks can change lives as well. A friend is kind to you, knows and likes you, and wishes the best for you.</p>
<p>The scriptures talk about loving your neighbor. There may be a difference between a neighbor and a friend, but I dont think anyone would question that the good Samaritan described in Luke 10:2937 was truly a friend to the man from Jericho. You know the story: A man from Jericho fell among thieves and was beaten. A priest and a Levite both passed the wounded man, and neither offered help.</p>
<p><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</i></p>
<p><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</i></p>
<p><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i></p>
<p><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</i></p>
<p><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</i> [Luke 10:3337]</p>
<p>I think there is a very simple test for determining if someone is a good friend. Does your association with that person make you a better person? Does he or she inspire you to be the best that you can be? Does your friendship with that person sustain you during difficult times? Do you desire to make the world a better place for your friend? Do take time to make friends.</p>
<h2><b>Make Friends with a Wide Variety of People</b></h2>
<p>The second point I would like to make is that we should make friends with all different types of people. There is often a great deal of loneliness on a campus this large. While talking to new people may be easy for some, for others it takes an extraordinary effort. Some people are self-conscious and painfully shy. As a mother I was aware of such diversities in my children, who are different from each other in their abilities to make friends. When they were young, two of my children could keep a room of people engaged and entertained, while the other two were quieter in temperament. One ran into the library and hid under a table when asked to read an essay at school. They have all matured now and all have friends, but, most important of all, they are friends to each other.</p>
<p>Even with our similarities, we as humans have many differences. If you are gregarious, take the time to befriend a quieter person - you can learn that quietness and silence are great teachers. If you are on the shy side, make the effort to get to know a few others; someone who is more outgoing could teach you how to speak up and be responsive in a group. Learn from each other.</p>
<p>I have noticed that there are some people who attract a large group of friends. Sometimes they attract more people than they can truly, reasonably spend a lot of time with. Often people who want to be their friend are offended when they do not receive the attention they would like. Dont be offended. Remember: friendships take time and nurturing. There are so many others who would love to have you for a friend and spend time with you. If you take offense that you have been left out or ignored, you will not be ready to see the possibilities for friendships with the people around you.</p>
<p>In <i>The Weight of Glory, </i>C. S. Lewis wrote:</p>
<p><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics.</i> <i>There are no</i> ordinary <i>people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. . . . Your neighbour is the holiest object presented to your senses.</i> [C. S. Lewis, <i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1949), 1415; emphasis in original]</p>
<p>Make friends with a wide variety of people.</p>
<h2><b>Make Your Spouse Your Friend</b></h2>
<p>The third issue regarding friendship that I would like to discuss is that of making your spouse your friend. Some of you may marry someone you have known since you were children together, but most of you will not. You will marry someone you have gotten to know within months, or even a few years, before you marry. While your affection for one another is a good beginning for a strong relationship, it may take more to sustain a lifelong relationship. Hopefully the years will open up a wealth of experiences that you can share. But becoming true friends with each other will take time. Take time to listen to each others concerns, dreams, and interests; plan things together; and support each other as best you can. Include each other in your everyday lives. Learn to appreciate that your spouse is unique and different from you and seek to understand him or her, even if you disagree. Encourage your spouse to develop his or her talents and interests, but also do things you both enjoy together. Again, remember that it takes time to make and keep a friend.</p>
<p>My husband and I have nearly raised our children, and now we have more time to nurture our relationship. Boy, was I clever! I married an amazing person - he gets better and better as I get to know him. I enjoy talking to him, listening to him, and just being with him. We dont agree on everything, but we do agree on the important things. I wish you well in making your spouse your best friend.</p>
<h2><b>Make Christ Your Friend</b></h2>
<p>The last issue I would like to address about friendship is that precious relationship you have with Christ. Some of you may know the song "What a Friend We Have in Jesus," with words by Joseph M. Scriven and music by Charles C. Converse:</p>
<p><i>What a friend we have in Jesus,</i></p>
<p><i>All our sins and griefs to bear!</i></p>
<p><i>What a privilege to carry</i></p>
<p><i>Everything to God in prayer!</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, what peace we often forfeit,</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, what needless pain we bear,</i></p>
<p><i>All because we do not carry</i></p>
<p><i>Everything to God in prayer!</i></p>
<p>The song implores us to take our grief, our sorrow, and our burdens to the Lord in prayer. He truly is our friend, and we can take our troubles to Him. He can be the friend we need.</p>
<p>Christs atoning sacrifice is the essential cornerstone of our lives:</p>
<p><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i> [John 3:16]</p>
<p>Through His atoning sacrifice we are made whole. It is a very unique and transforming experience to know and understand Christs gift to us. Does it change you to know Him? What have you done because you know Him?</p>
<p>When I was a little older than most of you students, I moved to Utah from back East. I had made wonderful girlfriends in Boston, and a group of us moved from Boston to the West. (Weve stayed in contact - many of us are dear friends today.) One of my friends had taken a position as a schoolteacher in Cokeville, Wyoming, and five of us planned a wonderful outing to visit her there for one day in May. We planned to go horseback riding in the afternoon, stay overnight, and return to Salt Lake the next day.</p>
<p>We arrived in the late morning, and within a short while we got into our friends very large Cadillac to drive to the riding stables, which were just over a mountain pass about 45 minutes away. It was cool in the morning, but by the time we left it was warm and pleasant. Some of us were dressed for riding - wearing boots, long pants, and a coat. Others had sneakers and sweaters. The car easily held all six of us.</p>
<p>We began the climb over the pass. As we made a turn, we saw an eagle in the road. It took off and soared in slow, arcing circles. It was a spectacular sight - a great omen for a wonderful day ahead, right? As we climbed higher, snow started to dot the sides of the road. The road started turning to mush, and it was getting harder to go forward. Even though we were still going up, we thought we must have been getting close to our destination. Eventually the car would go no farther - it was so mired in mud that we could not move it forward or backward. We tried everything we could think to do.</p>
<p>Because we were almost there, we got out and started walking toward the stables. We walked for a couple of hours, and it was hard in the muck and snow. We couldnt see any stables, houses, or any kind of shelter, and it was starting to get cold - it even starting snowing. We knew we needed to get back to the car for safety for the night, so we headed back.</p>
<p>By the time we got there, it was dark. We spent the night in the car. The only food we had was a box of cereal and a few candies, but our spirits were still high. We stayed warm by turning the heater on and off, and we tried to sleep, but, as you can imagine, it did not come easily. We prayed simply and earnestly for help and courage to handle the situation.</p>
<p>As the sun came up the next morning, we still couldnt get the car out. One person was only wearing sneakers, and her feet had become red and blistered from all the walking the previous day. She was unable to walk easily or quickly. Another friend stayed with her in the car while four of us started to walk back in the direction we had come.</p>
<p>We had walked for about an hour or two when we came upon two fishermen. They told us that they could not drive us out to the town from where they were because the roads needed to dry before their jeep could get out. They had been camping and had a campfire and food; they generously prepared a wonderful breakfast for us.</p>
<p>A little later, one of the men took the jeep and went in search of our car. He returned with my other two friends, who had started to walk; they were hobbling as they got out of the car. As these men were feeding my friends, one of them heated a pot of water, and after it was warm he had my friends sit down. He took each of my friends feet and washed them, putting some salve on their sores and blisters and socks on their feet. The tender comfort and healing efforts of these two men was in similitude of our Savior. I dont know these men. The only piece of information that I remember was that they worked for the <i>Ogden Standard-Examiner.</i> A couple of hours later they drove us to my friends house, and we returned to Salt Lake later that day.</p>
<p>As I recall that day, I dont remember being afraid or even worried very much. Three decades later, I remember vividly not the near tragedy but the beautiful image of true compassion - a compassionate man washing the feet of a stranger.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for my wonderful friends. I ask those of you who know Christ, who believe in Christ, and who have faith in Christ to let His example help you be a friend to others. Make a wide variety of friends. Make your spouse your friend. And, without question, make Christ your friend. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, President Samuelson. It is great to be here today. As that choir was singing, it reminded me that my wife and I met with our seats assigned in a choir just like that a few years back, and weve been sitting next to each other ever since.
This place is really like a second home to me. I spent a good part of my adult life at BYU. When people ask me how long Ive been here - which they do at times - I say I came with Karl G. Maeser. So this is where we met, and this is where our children received their education. Its where I came to understand that learning can go on forever. I love the students here. I love the staff. I love the faculty. I love games like the one we had with Wyoming on Saturday. I like championships. I love BYU.
When Im walking across campus, I like to say hello to as many people as I can. I especially like it if they say hello back. I guess its my retro way of doing social networking. I once looked at a student approaching me on the sidewalk. She was on her cell phone - which oftentimes we are - but she still gave me a cell-phone wave. Quite often those I pass on the sidewalk are using headphones. But sometimes I even get a headphone nod. And this morning I got a headphone smile.
Once I was sitting outside a conference room in the library working on my laptop. A student approached me and asked a little awkwardly, "So, what are you doing?"
I explained that I was waiting for a meeting, but then I closed my laptop, stood up, and said, "You know, students never do that to me. They never just come up and start a conversation. Why did you do that?"
He responded, "Well, I thought I might learn something."
We had a memorable conversation. He had just returned from a mission, and he shared some of his favorite experiences with me.
Meeting new people can enrich our lives in miraculous ways. My wife and I recently visited Bucaramanga, Colombia, on a Church assignment. Bucaramanga is a city of 1.2 million very friendly people. In fact, they pride themselves on being the friendliest city on the planet. When we arrived, many were there to greet us. They made us feel like we were the most important people they had ever met. We had never been to this city before. We had never seen the people who were greeting us. And yet we felt their love.
Love is one of the most powerful positive forces in existence. It is one of the strongest statements in all of scripture, and it occurs twice in Moroni: "If ye have not charity, ye are nothing" (Moroni 7:46; also see verse 44). No matter how competent we might be, how bright, how talented, how athletic, how attractive, how hardworking - if we are not acting out of love, we are nothing. Those people in Bucaramanga were not thinking of themselves. They were not trying to prove anything to anyone. They were simply reaching out to us in love. And that student who approached me in the library literally made my day. Hi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear young friends, it is a great privilege and honor to be able to address you in this CES fireside. I am grateful to be here in the Marriott Center on the campus of Brigham Young University and to speak to those of you gathered in locations throughout the entire world in many different circumstances and languages. Thank you for coming. You honor the Lord Jesus Christ by putting aside other matters in your lives to join together at this time. I am grateful to be here with my wife, Melanie, and a number of our family and dear friends.
I pray that my remarks will be guided by the Holy Ghost and that you will feel in your own hearts that what I have to say has relevancy to what you are facing and what you are experiencing at this time in your lives.
The Importance of Righteous Friendships
Many years ago, in March of 1839, the Prophet Joseph Smith, with several of his companions, had been wrongfully incarcerated for months at Liberty Jail. Many writers of Church history have said that this experience for the Prophet Joseph was certainly one of the most difficult and darkest periods of his entire life. His words "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;C 121:1) - as recorded in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants - speak of a desperate loneliness in the bleakest of settings.
The Lord did not appear or send angels; He did not thrash the guards or swing wide the door of that damp, dirty cell. Put simply, He did not change the circumstances, but He spoke comfort and reassurance to Joseph like no other could: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" (D&amp;C 121:7). It was as if the Lord put His arm around Joseph when He said, "My son." Those are precious and tender words. And then He put a timetable on Josephs hardship - "a small moment." What a lesson for all of us to remember. Our hardships will be brief - in eternal terms - and the Lord will be right there.
Then the Lord said this: "Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands" (D&amp;C 121:9).
Here was Joseph, locked in jail by the treachery of men, some of whom had once been his close associates. But the Lord made the point so clear - "thy friends do stand by thee." How comforting that declaration was to the Prophet Joseph; how comforting to us. Think for a minute what it means to you to know you have someone standing right by you, someone you can trust to be your friend on good days and bad, someone who values you and supports you even when the two of you are apart.
Our most prized friend is Jesus Christ Himself. Is there any greater assurance than His "I will be on your right hand and on your left, . . . and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;C 84:88)? So often those "angels round about" are our friends.
My message tonight centers on the importance in each of our lives</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Let me begin by telling you a little about myself. In the process I will share with you my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ as well as the three key ingredients we need to ensure happiness and peace in this life and give us a taste of what life will be like in our heavenly home.
I grew up in the Queens borough of New York City. New York City is a wonderful place that is full of excitement and entertainment. As a youth I was heavily involved with rap music, and my brother and I belonged to a rap group called CBS. No, it was not the television station. The acronym CBS stood for Cant Be Stopped. We thought the name was cool.
We traveled throughout the city performing at wedding receptions, high school dances, and block parties. During the summer months different rap groups would visit the neighborhood park to perform free concerts. Most of the youth involved with rap visited the parks to listen and, at times, compete with the other rap groups. Often, however, these free concerts attracted drug deals and promoted random violence.
It was during the summer of my 14th year that a random violent event occurred - which I will not go into - that provided me an opportunity to leave New York City and changed the course of my life forever.
During that time I was fortunate that my mother decided to send the family money and invited all of the children to come live with her in Hawaii. The money came at the right time, and that week I purchased a one-way ticket to Hawaii.
When I arrived in Hawaii, I quickly recognized its many differences from New York City - the oceans clear blue water and the fresh cool breeze at night. I also recognized the many different nationalities and cultures. After my first day of attending Mililani High School, I came home and told my mother that it had felt like I was representing Africa at a United Nations meeting.
During the first few weeks of high school, the basketball coach noticed that I was one of the tallest young men on campus, and he invited me to try out for the basketball team. While living in New York I had not played much basketball. I enjoyed baseball and was on the bowling team, but I had never played on a basketball team. I believe it was because of my height that I started on the varsity team as a sophomore.
We won three basketball games that year, and everyone in the community was excited because it was three more games than the team had won the year before. In my junior year we won six games, and by the time I was a senior we had won 14 games and we became the Western Division champions, which advanced us to the Hawaii state play-offs. Because of my successful senior year, I was recruited to play basketball for BYUHawaii. All I knew about BYUHawaii was that it was a church school similar to Notre Dame or a St. Marys University.
At the start of the fall semester I was instructed by my academic adv</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Right up front I would like to thank Kay Johnson. She has helped me with all of the details and has granted all of my wishes except one. I asked her if I could bring my cardiologist along with me to sit by my side. Hopefully I can get through this talk without needing one.
I love BYU. I love the students here. I love the faculty and the staff and the administrators. I have made many friends while being here.
Im going to focus on being a good friend, and I ask that all of you might reflect on what kind of a friend you are. We all function so much better when we are friends. We are united.
I love to tell stories. I hope you like to listen to stories. Im going to start with life before kindergarten, then life during grade school, then junior high, then high school, and then college. Now, I very much dislike boasting, so Im going to tell you stories, by and large, of events in which I did some dumb things and good friends picked me up.
How do we qualify as a good friend? How may we be a good friend to others on a constant basis? I believe a true friend is a person who will bring out the best in us. We can have friends who do not bring out the best in us. I hope we all have friends who lift us up. We all need to be lifted in life.
My first story involves a time when I was three and a half years of age. My mother called to me and said, "Lee, hurry up and get ready for church."
I was very defensive and said, "I do not want to go to church."
She said, "But Jesus wants you to."
I defiantly stated, "I never see Him there."
Well, it is funny, but my mother wasnt amused. She knew her work was cut out for her, and she started reading from a book that she had had when she was a small girl - the same book that President Hinckley had had when he was the same age as my mother. Their mothers read to them.
This is a book that I still have. Light blue and dog-eared, its entitled The Life of Our Lord, and it was a beautiful book, especially when Mother read.
I remember that she placed a beautiful picture of the Savior over the piano in our living room as a constant reminder, and I have loved that picture. When my mother passed away, we hung the picture on the wall in our family room. Oh, how I love my family: my mother and father, my grandparents, and my many relatives. Eight of my 10 children are here, and one is in Detroit and one is in Baltimore. I know I love all of them more because I learned to love my Savior.
Going to elementary school in the fifth grade, I did something really dumb. Just before Valentines Day my teacher asked all of us children to make Valentine boxes out of shoeboxes. Youve probably done the same thing; you might still do it today. We had white paper and white paper lace and red hearts. On Valentines morning Mother said, "Now, Lee, you remember to give a Valentine to each one of the pupils in your class."
