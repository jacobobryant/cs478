  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you very much, Bob. I appreciate this great privilege each time that it is mine, my brothers and sisters. I am grateful to the choral group today for that last number, the lyrics of which I hope will linger with you somewhat, because I will turn to them as I close my speech.

I have chosen to speak today about a very pedestrian principle: patience, I hope that I do not empty the Marriott Center by that selection. Perhaps the topic was selfishly selected because of my clear and continuing need to develop further this very important attribute. But my interest in patience is not solely personal; for the necessity of having this intriguing attribute is cited several times in the scriptures, including once by King Benjamin who, when clustering the attributes of sainthood, named patience as a charter member of that cluster (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18&quot;&gt;Mosiah 3:19&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23?lang=eng#p22&quot;&gt;Alma 7:23&lt;/a&gt;).

Patience is not indifference. Actually, it means caring very much but being willing, nevertheless, to submit to the Lord and to what the scriptures call the "process of time."

Patience is tied very closely to faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient we are suggesting that we know what is best - better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than His. Either way we are questioning the reality of Gods omniscience as if, as some seem to believe, God were on some sort of postdoctoral fellowship and were not quite in charge of everything.

Saint Teresa of Avila said that unless we come to know the reality of God, including his omniscience, our mortal existence "will be no more than a night in a second-class hotel" (quoted by Malcolm Muggerridge in "The Great Liberal Death Wish," &lt;i&gt;Imprimis&lt;/i&gt; [Hillsdale College, Michigan], May 1979.) Our second estate can be a first-class experience only if you and I develop a patient faith in God and in his unfolding purposes.

We read in Mosiah about how the Lord simultaneously tries the patience of His people even as He tries their faith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.21?lang=eng#p20&quot;&gt;Mosiah 23:21&lt;/a&gt;). One is not only to endure, but to endure well and gracefully those things which the Lord "seeth fit to inflict upon [us]" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p18&quot;&gt;Mosiah 3:19)&lt;/a&gt;, just as did a group of ancient American saints who were bearing unusual burdens but who submitted "cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.15?lang=eng#p14&quot;&gt;Mosiah 24:15&lt;/a&gt;).

Paul, speaking to the Hebrews, brings us up short by writing that, even after faithful disciples had "done the will of God," they "[had] need of patience" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/10.36?lang=eng#p35&quot;&gt;Hebrews 10:36&lt;/a&gt;). How many times have good individuals done the right thing only to break or wear away under subsequent stress, canceling out much of the value of what they had already so painstakingly done? Sometimes that which we are doing is correct enough but simply needs to be persisted in patiently, not for a minute or a moment but sometimes for years. Paul speaks of the marathon of life and of how we must "run with patience the race that is set before us" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.1?lang=eng#primary&quot;&gt;Hebrews 12:1&lt;/a&gt;). Paul did not select the hundred-meter dash for his analogy!

The Lord has twice said: "And seek the face of the Lord always, that &lt;i&gt;in patience ye may possess your souls&lt;/i&gt;, and ye shall have eternal life" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.38?lang=eng#p37&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 101:38&lt;/a&gt;, emphasis added; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/21.19?lang=eng#p18&quot;&gt;Luke 21:19&lt;/a&gt;). Could it be, brothers and sisters, that only when our self-control becomes total do we come into the true possession of our souls?

Patience is not only a companion of faith but is also a friend to free agency. Inside our impatience there is sometimes an ugly reality: We are plainly irritated and inconvenienced by the need to make allowance for the free agency of others. In our impatience - which is not the same thing as divine discontent - we would override others, even though it is obvious that our individual differences and preferences are so irretrievably enmeshed with each other that the only resolution which preserves free agency is our patience and longsuffering with each other.

The passage of time is not, by itself, an automatic cure for bad choices; but often individuals like the prodigal son can "in process of time" come to their senses. The touching reunion of Jacob and Esau in the desert, so many years after their youthful rivalry, is a classic example of how generosity can replace animosity when truth is mixed with time. When we are unduly impatient, we are, in effect, trying to hasten an outcome when this kind of acceleration would be to abuse agency. Enoch - brilliant, submissive, and spiritual - knew what it meant to see a whole city-culture advance in "process of time." He could tell us much about so many things, including patience. Patience makes possible a personal spiritual symmetry which arises only, brothers and sisters, from prolonged obedience within free agency.

There is also a dimension of patience which links it to a special reverence for life. Patience is a willingness, in a sense, to watch the unfolding purposes of God with a sense of wonder and awe, rather than pacing up and down within the cell of our circumstance. Put another way, too much anxious opening of the oven door and the cake falls instead of rising. So it is with us. If we are always selfishly taking our temperature to see if we are happy, we will not be.

When we are impatient, we are neither reverential nor reflective because we are too self-centered. Whereas faith and patience are companions, so are selfishness and impatience. It is so easy to be confrontive without being informative; so easy to be indignant without being intelligent; so easy to be impulsive without being insightful. It is so easy to command others when we are not in control of ourselves.

I remember as a child going eagerly to the corner store for what we then called an "all-day sucker." It would not have lasted all day under the best usage, but it could last quite awhile. The trick was to resist the temptation to bite into it, to learn to savor rather than to crunch and chew. The same savoring was needed with a precious square of Hershey milk chocolate to make the treat last, especially in depression times.

In life, however, even patiently stretching out sweetness is sometimes not enough; in certain situations, enjoyment must actually be deferred. A patient willingness to defer dividends is a hallmark of individual maturity. It is, parenthetically, a hallmark of free nations that their citizens can discipline themselves today for a better tomorrow. Yet America is in trouble (as are other nations) precisely because a patient persistence in a wise course of public policy is so difficult to attain. Too many impatient politicians buy todays votes with tomorrows inflation.

But back to the personal relevance of patience which, among many things, permits us to deal more effectively with the unevenness of lifes experiences. I recorded the substance of this speech about three months ago while driving to a stake conference in Elko, Nevada, across that rather barren, but beautiful in its own way, stretch of desert. (Incidentally, as soon as most of this speech on patience was dictated my car threw two fan belts!) During that drive, it was brought forcibly to me that the seeming flat periods of life give us a blessed chance to reflect upon what is past as well as to be readied for some rather stirring climbs ahead. Instead of grumbling and murmuring, we should be consolidating and reflecting, which would not be possible if life were an uninterrupted sequence of fantastic scenery, confrontive events, and exhilarating conversation.

Patience helps us to use, rather than to protest, these seeming flat periods of life, becoming filled with quiet wonder over the past and with anticipation for that which may lie ahead, instead of demeaning the particular flatness through which we may be passing at the time. We should savor even the seemingly ordinary times, for life cannot be made up all of kettledrums and crashing cymbals. There must be some flutes and violins. Living cannot be all crescendo; there must be some dynamic contrast.

Clearly, without patience we will learn less in life. We will see less; we will feel less; we will hear less. Ironically, "rush" and "more" usually mean "less." The pressure of "now," time and time again, go against the grain of the gospel with its eternalism.

There is also in patience a greater opportunity for that discernment which sorts out the things that matter most from the things that matter least. The mealtime episode of the Savior in the home of Mary and Martha is an example. Anxious, impatient Martha focused on getting food on the table while Mary wisely chose "the good part" - companionship and conversation instead of calories - a good choice, the Savior said, which would not be taken from her.

In our approach to life, patience also helps us to realize that while we may be ready to move on, having had enough of a particular learning experience, our continued presence is often needed as a part of the learning environment of others. Patience is thus closely connected with two other central attributes of Christianity - love and humility. Paul said to the saints at Thessalonica, "Be patient toward all men" - clearly a part of keeping the second great commandment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.14?lang=eng#p13&quot;&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:14&lt;/a&gt;).

The patient person assumes that what others have to say is worth listening to. A patient person is not so chronically eager to put forth his or her own ideas. In true humility, we do some waiting upon others. We value them for what they say and what they have to contribute. Patience and humility are special friends.

Since our competition in life, as Elder Boyd K. Packer has perceptively said, is solely with our old self, we ought to be free, you and I, as members of the Church, from the jealousies and anxieties of the world which go with interpersonal competition. Very importantly, it is patience, when combined with love, which permits us "in process of time" to detoxify our disappointments. Patience and love take the radioactivity out of our resentments. These are neither small nor occasional needs in most of our lives.

Further, the patient person can better understand how there are circumstances when, if our hearts are set too much upon the things of this world, they must be broken - but for our sakes, and not merely as a demonstration of divine power. But it takes real patience in such circumstances to wait for the later vindication of our trust in the Lord.

Therefore, if we use the process of time well, it can cradle us as we develop patient humility. Keats tenderly observed: "Time, that aged nurse, /Rockd me to patience" (John Bartlett, &lt;i&gt;Familiar Quotations&lt;/i&gt;, 14th ed. [Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1968], p. 580). Clearly, patience so cradles us when we are in the midst of suffering. Paul, who suffered much, observed in his epistle to the Hebrews: "Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.11?lang=eng#p10&quot;&gt;Hebrews 12:11&lt;/a&gt;).

Patience permits us to cling to our faith in the Lord when we are tossed about by suffering as if by surf. When the undertow grasps us, we will realize that even as we tumble we are somehow being carried forward; we are actually being helped even as we cry for help.

One of the functions of the tribulations of the righteous is that "tribulation worketh patience" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.3?lang=eng#p2&quot;&gt;Romans 5:3&lt;/a&gt;). What a vital attribute patience is if tribulation is worth enduring to bring about its development! Patience in turn brings about the needed experience, as noted in the stunning insight the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng#p6&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 122:7&lt;/a&gt;). Perhaps one can be forgiven if, in response to this sobering insight, his soul shivers just a bit. James also stressed the importance of patience when our faith is being tried, because those grueling experiences "[work] patience," and said, in what was almost a sigh of the soul, "Let patience have her perfect work . . ." (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.3-4?lang=eng#p2&quot;&gt;James 1:3-4&lt;/a&gt;).

To Joseph Smith, the Lord described patience as having a special finishing and concluding quality, for "These things remain to overcome through patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.66?lang=eng#p65&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 63:66&lt;/a&gt;). A patient disciple, for instance, will not be surprised nor undone when the Church is misrepresented. Peter, being toughminded as well as tender, made the test of our patience even more precise and demanding when he said, "For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.20?lang=eng#p19&quot;&gt;1 Peter 2:20&lt;/a&gt;). The dues of discipleship are high indeed, and how much we can take so often determines how much we can then give. I believe it was George MacDonald who observed that, in the process of life, we are not always the already-tempered and helpful hammer which is shaping and pounding another. Sometimes we are merely the anvil.

Thus, as already indicated, patience is a vital mortal virtue in relation to our faith, our free agency, our attitude toward life, our humility, and our suffering. Moreover, patience will not be an obsolete attribute in the next world.

My brothers and sisters, the longer I examine the gospel of Jesus Christ, the more I understand that the Lords commitment to free agency is very deep - indeed, much deeper than is our own. The more I live, the more I also sense how exquisite is His perfect love of us. It is, in fact, the very interplay of Gods everlasting commitment to free agency and His everlasting and perfect love for us which inevitably places a high premium upon the virtue of patience. There is simply no other way for true growth to occur.

Gods attributes of omniscience and omnipotence no doubt made the plan of salvation feasible. But it was His perfect love which made the plan inevitable. And it is His perfect patience which makes it sustainable. Do we not, again and again, get breathtaking glimpses of Gods perfect patience in the execution of the plan of salvation, concerning which He has said that his "course is one eternal round" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.2?lang=eng#p1&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 3:2&lt;/a&gt;)?

Thus it is that patience is to human nature what photosynthesis is to nature. Photosynthesis, the most important single chemical reaction we know, brings together water, light, chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide, processing annually the hundreds of trillions of tons of carbon dioxide and converting them to oxygen as part of the process of making food and fuel. The marvelous process of photosynthesis is crucial to life on this planet, and it is a very constant and patient process. So, too, is an individuals spiritual growth. Neither patience nor photosynthesis are conspicuous processes.

Patience is always involved in the spiritual chemistry of the soul, not only when we try to turn the trials and tribulations - the carbon dioxide, as it were - into joy and growth, but also when we use it to build upon the seemingly ordinary experiences to bring about happy and spiritual outcomes.

Patience is, therefore, clearly not fatalistic, shoulder-shrugging resignation. It is the acceptance of a divine rhythm to life; it is obedience prolonged. Patience stoutly resists pulling up the daisies to see how the roots are doing. Patience is never condescending or exclusive - it is never glad when others are left out. Patience never preens itself; it prefers keeping the window of the soul open.

I have struggled to find adequate words to express these concluding feelings and these thoughts about our need to be patient with ourselves and with our circumstances in this second estate.

Some of us have been momentarily wrenched by the sound of a train whistle spilling into the night air, and we have been inexplicably subdued by the mix of feelings that this evokes. Or perhaps we have been beckoned by a lighted cottage across a snow-covered meadow at dusk. Or we have heard the warm and drawing laughter of children at a nearby playground. Or we have been tugged at by the strains of congregational singing from a nearby church. Or we have encountered a particular fragrance which has awakened memories deep within us of things which once were. In such moments, we have felt a deep yearning, as if we were temporarily outside of something to which we actually belonged and of which we so much wanted again to be a part.

There are spiritual equivalents of these moments. Such seem to occur most often when time touches eternity. In these moments we feel a longing closeness - but we are still separate. The partition which produces this paradox is something we call the veil - a partition the presence of which requires our patience. We define the veil as the border between mortality and eternity; it is also a film of forgetting which covers the memories of earlier experiences. This forgetfulness will be lifted one day, and on that day we will see forever - rather than "through a glass, darkly" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12?lang=eng#p11&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 13:12&lt;/a&gt;).

There are poignant and frequent reminders of the veil, adding to our sense of being close but still outside. In our deepest prayers, when the agency of man encounters the omniscience of God, we sometimes sense, if only momentarily, how very provincial our petitions are; we perceive that there are more good answers than we have good questions; and we realize that we have been taught more than we can tell, for the language used is not that which the tongue can transmit.

We experience this same close separateness when a baby is born, but also as we wait with those who are dying - for then we brush against the veil, as goodbyes and greetings are said almost within earshot of each other. In such moments, this resonance with realities on the other side of the veil is so obvious that it can be explained in only one way!

No wonder the Savior said that His doctrines would be recognized by His sheep, that we would know His voice, that we would follow Him (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.14?lang=eng#p13&quot;&gt;John 10:14&lt;/a&gt;). We do not, therefore, follow strangers. Deep within us, His doctrines do strike the promised chord of familiarity and underscore our true identity. Our sense of belonging grows in spite of our sense of separateness; for His teachings stir our souls, awakening feelings within us which have somehow survived underneath the encrusting experiences of mortality.

This inner serenity which the believer knows as he brushes against the veil is cousin to certitude. The peace it brings surpasses our understanding and certainly our capacity to explain. But it requires a patience which stands in stark contrast to the restlessness of the world in which, said Isaiah, the wicked are like the pounding and troubled sea which cannot rest (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/57.20?lang=eng#p19&quot;&gt;Isaiah 57:20&lt;/a&gt;).

But mercifully the veil is there. It is fixed by the wisdom of God for our good. It is no use being impatient with the Lord over that reality, for it is clearly a condition to which we agreed so long ago. Even when the veil is parted briefly, it will be on His terms, not ours. Without the veil, we would lose that precious insulation which would constantly interfere with our mortal probation and maturation. Without the veil, our brief mortal walk in a darkening world would lose its meaning - for one would scarcely carry the flashlight of faith at noonday and in the presence of the Light of the World. Without the veil, we could not experience the gospel of work and the sweat of our brow. If we had the security of having already entered into Gods rest, certain things would be unneeded; Adam and Eve did not clutch social security cards in the Garden of Eden.

And how could we learn about obedience if we were shielded from the consequences of our disobedience? And how could we learn patience under pressure if we did not experience pressure and waiting? Nor could we choose for ourselves if we were already in His holy presence, for some alternatives do not there exist. Besides, Gods Court is filled with those who have patiently overcome - whose company we do not yet deserve.

Fortunately, the veil keeps the first, second, and third estates separate - hence our sense of separateness. The veil avoids having things &quot;compound in one&quot; to our everlasting detriment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#p10&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 2:11&lt;/a&gt;). We are cocooned, as it were, in order that we might truly choose. Once, long ago, we chose to come to this very setting where we could choose. It was an irrevocable choice. And the veil is the guarantor that our ancient choice will be honored.

When the veil which encloses us is no more, time will also be no more (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.100?lang=eng#p99&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 84:100&lt;/a&gt;). Even now, time is clearly not our natural dimension. Thus it is that we are never really at home in time. Alternately, we find ourselves impatiently wishing to hasten the passage of time or to hold back the dawn. We can do neither, of course. Whereas the bird is at home in the air, we are clearly not at home in time - because we belong to eternity. Time, as much as any one thing, whispers to us that we are strangers here. If time were natural to us, why is it that we have so many clocks and wear wristwatches?

Thus the veil stands - not to shut us out forever, but to remind us of Gods tutoring and patient love for us. Any brush against the veil produces a feeling of "not yet," but also faint whispers of anticipation of that moment when, in the words of todays choral hymn, "Come, Let Us Anew," those who have prevailed "by the patience and hope and the labor of love" will hear the glorious words," Well and faithfully done; / Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne " (&lt;i&gt;Hymns&lt;/i&gt;, number 17).

May each of us live for that special moment patiently and righteously, I pray in the name of Him who is so patient with me as I strive to be an "especial witness" for him in all the world, even Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Thank you very much, Bob. I appreciate this great privilege each time that it is mine, my brothers and sisters. I am grateful to the choral group today for that last number, the lyrics of which I hope will linger with you somewhat, because I will turn to them as I close my speech.</p>
<p>I have chosen to speak today about a very pedestrian principle: patience, I hope that I do not empty the Marriott Center by that selection. Perhaps the topic was selfishly selected because of my clear and continuing need to develop further this very important attribute. But my interest in patience is not solely personal; for the necessity of having this intriguing attribute is cited several times in the scriptures, including once by King Benjamin who, when clustering the attributes of sainthood, named patience as a charter member of that cluster (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18">Mosiah 3:19</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23?lang=eng#p22">Alma 7:23</a>).</p>
<p>Patience is not indifference. Actually, it means caring very much but being willing, nevertheless, to submit to the Lord and to what the scriptures call the "process of time."</p>
<p>Patience is tied very closely to faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient we are suggesting that we know what is best - better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than His. Either way we are questioning the reality of Gods omniscience as if, as some seem to believe, God were on some sort of postdoctoral fellowship and were not quite in charge of everything.</p>
<p>Saint Teresa of Avila said that unless we come to know the reality of God, including his omniscience, our mortal existence "will be no more than a night in a second-class hotel" (quoted by Malcolm Muggerridge in "The Great Liberal Death Wish," <i>Imprimis</i> [Hillsdale College, Michigan], May 1979.) Our second estate can be a first-class experience only if you and I develop a patient faith in God and in his unfolding purposes.</p>
<p>We read in Mosiah about how the Lord simultaneously tries the patience of His people even as He tries their faith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.21?lang=eng#p20">Mosiah 23:21</a>). One is not only to endure, but to endure well and gracefully those things which the Lord "seeth fit to inflict upon [us]" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p18">Mosiah 3:19)</a>, just as did a group of ancient American saints who were bearing unusual burdens but who submitted "cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.15?lang=eng#p14">Mosiah 24:15</a>).</p>
<p>Paul, speaking to the Hebrews, brings us up short by writing that, even after faithful disciples had "done the will of God," they "[had] need of patience" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/10.36?lang=eng#p35">Hebrews 10:36</a>). How many times have good individuals done the right thing only to break or wear away under subsequent stress, canceling out much of the value of what they had already so painstakingly done? Sometimes that which we are doing is correct enough but simply needs to be persisted in patiently, not for a minute or a moment but sometimes for years. Paul speaks of the marathon of life and of how we must "run with patience the race that is set before us" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.1?lang=eng#primary">Hebrews 12:1</a>). Paul did not select the hundred-meter dash for his analogy!</p>
<p>The Lord has twice said: "And seek the face of the Lord always, that <i>in patience ye may possess your souls</i>, and ye shall have eternal life" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.38?lang=eng#p37">D&amp;C 101:38</a>, emphasis added; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/21.19?lang=eng#p18">Luke 21:19</a>). Could it be, brothers and sisters, that only when our self-control becomes total do we come into the true possession of our souls?</p>
<p>Patience is not only a companion of faith but is also a friend to free agency. Inside our impatience there is sometimes an ugly reality: We are plainly irritated and inconvenienced by the need to make allowance for the free agency of others. In our impatience - which is not the same thing as divine discontent - we would override others, even though it is obvious that our individual differences and preferences are so irretrievably enmeshed with each other that the only resolution which preserves free agency is our patience and longsuffering with each other.</p>
<p>The passage of time is not, by itself, an automatic cure for bad choices; but often individuals like the prodigal son can "in process of time" come to their senses. The touching reunion of Jacob and Esau in the desert, so many years after their youthful rivalry, is a classic example of how generosity can replace animosity when truth is mixed with time. When we are unduly impatient, we are, in effect, trying to hasten an outcome when this kind of acceleration would be to abuse agency. Enoch - brilliant, submissive, and spiritual - knew what it meant to see a whole city-culture advance in "process of time." He could tell us much about so many things, including patience. Patience makes possible a personal spiritual symmetry which arises only, brothers and sisters, from prolonged obedience within free agency.</p>
<p>There is also a dimension of patience which links it to a special reverence for life. Patience is a willingness, in a sense, to watch the unfolding purposes of God with a sense of wonder and awe, rather than pacing up and down within the cell of our circumstance. Put another way, too much anxious opening of the oven door and the cake falls instead of rising. So it is with us. If we are always selfishly taking our temperature to see if we are happy, we will not be.</p>
<p>When we are impatient, we are neither reverential nor reflective because we are too self-centered. Whereas faith and patience are companions, so are selfishness and impatience. It is so easy to be confrontive without being informative; so easy to be indignant without being intelligent; so easy to be impulsive without being insightful. It is so easy to command others when we are not in control of ourselves.</p>
<p>I remember as a child going eagerly to the corner store for what we then called an "all-day sucker." It would not have lasted all day under the best usage, but it could last quite awhile. The trick was to resist the temptation to bite into it, to learn to savor rather than to crunch and chew. The same savoring was needed with a precious square of Hershey milk chocolate to make the treat last, especially in depression times.</p>
<p>In life, however, even patiently stretching out sweetness is sometimes not enough; in certain situations, enjoyment must actually be deferred. A patient willingness to defer dividends is a hallmark of individual maturity. It is, parenthetically, a hallmark of free nations that their citizens can discipline themselves today for a better tomorrow. Yet America is in trouble (as are other nations) precisely because a patient persistence in a wise course of public policy is so difficult to attain. Too many impatient politicians buy todays votes with tomorrows inflation.</p>
<p>But back to the personal relevance of patience which, among many things, permits us to deal more effectively with the unevenness of lifes experiences. I recorded the substance of this speech about three months ago while driving to a stake conference in Elko, Nevada, across that rather barren, but beautiful in its own way, stretch of desert. (Incidentally, as soon as most of this speech on patience was dictated my car threw two fan belts!) During that drive, it was brought forcibly to me that the seeming flat periods of life give us a blessed chance to reflect upon what is past as well as to be readied for some rather stirring climbs ahead. Instead of grumbling and murmuring, we should be consolidating and reflecting, which would not be possible if life were an uninterrupted sequence of fantastic scenery, confrontive events, and exhilarating conversation.</p>
<p>Patience helps us to use, rather than to protest, these seeming flat periods of life, becoming filled with quiet wonder over the past and with anticipation for that which may lie ahead, instead of demeaning the particular flatness through which we may be passing at the time. We should savor even the seemingly ordinary times, for life cannot be made up all of kettledrums and crashing cymbals. There must be some flutes and violins. Living cannot be all crescendo; there must be some dynamic contrast.</p>
<p>Clearly, without patience we will learn less in life. We will see less; we will feel less; we will hear less. Ironically, "rush" and "more" usually mean "less." The pressure of "now," time and time again, go against the grain of the gospel with its eternalism.</p>
<p>There is also in patience a greater opportunity for that discernment which sorts out the things that matter most from the things that matter least. The mealtime episode of the Savior in the home of Mary and Martha is an example. Anxious, impatient Martha focused on getting food on the table while Mary wisely chose "the good part" - companionship and conversation instead of calories - a good choice, the Savior said, which would not be taken from her.</p>
<p>In our approach to life, patience also helps us to realize that while we may be ready to move on, having had enough of a particular learning experience, our continued presence is often needed as a part of the learning environment of others. Patience is thus closely connected with two other central attributes of Christianity - love and humility. Paul said to the saints at Thessalonica, "Be patient toward all men" - clearly a part of keeping the second great commandment (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.14?lang=eng#p13">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>).</p>
<p>The patient person assumes that what others have to say is worth listening to. A patient person is not so chronically eager to put forth his or her own ideas. In true humility, we do some waiting upon others. We value them for what they say and what they have to contribute. Patience and humility are special friends.</p>
<p>Since our competition in life, as Elder Boyd K. Packer has perceptively said, is solely with our old self, we ought to be free, you and I, as members of the Church, from the jealousies and anxieties of the world which go with interpersonal competition. Very importantly, it is patience, when combined with love, which permits us "in process of time" to detoxify our disappointments. Patience and love take the radioactivity out of our resentments. These are neither small nor occasional needs in most of our lives.</p>
<p>Further, the patient person can better understand how there are circumstances when, if our hearts are set too much upon the things of this world, they must be broken - but for our sakes, and not merely as a demonstration of divine power. But it takes real patience in such circumstances to wait for the later vindication of our trust in the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we use the process of time well, it can cradle us as we develop patient humility. Keats tenderly observed: "Time, that aged nurse, /Rockd me to patience" (John Bartlett, <i>Familiar Quotations</i>, 14th ed. [Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1968], p. 580). Clearly, patience so cradles us when we are in the midst of suffering. Paul, who suffered much, observed in his epistle to the Hebrews: "Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.11?lang=eng#p10">Hebrews 12:11</a>).</p>
<p>Patience permits us to cling to our faith in the Lord when we are tossed about by suffering as if by surf. When the undertow grasps us, we will realize that even as we tumble we are somehow being carried forward; we are actually being helped even as we cry for help.</p>
<p>One of the functions of the tribulations of the righteous is that "tribulation worketh patience" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.3?lang=eng#p2">Romans 5:3</a>). What a vital attribute patience is if tribulation is worth enduring to bring about its development! Patience in turn brings about the needed experience, as noted in the stunning insight the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng#p6">D&amp;C 122:7</a>). Perhaps one can be forgiven if, in response to this sobering insight, his soul shivers just a bit. James also stressed the importance of patience when our faith is being tried, because those grueling experiences "[work] patience," and said, in what was almost a sigh of the soul, "Let patience have her perfect work . . ." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.3-4?lang=eng#p2">James 1:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>To Joseph Smith, the Lord described patience as having a special finishing and concluding quality, for "These things remain to overcome through patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.66?lang=eng#p65">D&amp;C 63:66</a>). A patient disciple, for instance, will not be surprised nor undone when the Church is misrepresented. Peter, being toughminded as well as tender, made the test of our patience even more precise and demanding when he said, "For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.20?lang=eng#p19">1 Peter 2:20</a>). The dues of discipleship are high indeed, and how much we can take so often determines how much we can then give. I believe it was George MacDonald who observed that, in the process of life, we are not always the already-tempered and helpful hammer which is shaping and pounding another. Sometimes we are merely the anvil.</p>
<p>Thus, as already indicated, patience is a vital mortal virtue in relation to our faith, our free agency, our attitude toward life, our humility, and our suffering. Moreover, patience will not be an obsolete attribute in the next world.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, the longer I examine the gospel of Jesus Christ, the more I understand that the Lords commitment to free agency is very deep - indeed, much deeper than is our own. The more I live, the more I also sense how exquisite is His perfect love of us. It is, in fact, the very interplay of Gods everlasting commitment to free agency and His everlasting and perfect love for us which inevitably places a high premium upon the virtue of patience. There is simply no other way for true growth to occur.</p>
<p>Gods attributes of omniscience and omnipotence no doubt made the plan of salvation feasible. But it was His perfect love which made the plan inevitable. And it is His perfect patience which makes it sustainable. Do we not, again and again, get breathtaking glimpses of Gods perfect patience in the execution of the plan of salvation, concerning which He has said that his "course is one eternal round" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.2?lang=eng#p1">D&amp;C 3:2</a>)?</p>
<p>Thus it is that patience is to human nature what photosynthesis is to nature. Photosynthesis, the most important single chemical reaction we know, brings together water, light, chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide, processing annually the hundreds of trillions of tons of carbon dioxide and converting them to oxygen as part of the process of making food and fuel. The marvelous process of photosynthesis is crucial to life on this planet, and it is a very constant and patient process. So, too, is an individuals spiritual growth. Neither patience nor photosynthesis are conspicuous processes.</p>
<p>Patience is always involved in the spiritual chemistry of the soul, not only when we try to turn the trials and tribulations - the carbon dioxide, as it were - into joy and growth, but also when we use it to build upon the seemingly ordinary experiences to bring about happy and spiritual outcomes.</p>
<p>Patience is, therefore, clearly not fatalistic, shoulder-shrugging resignation. It is the acceptance of a divine rhythm to life; it is obedience prolonged. Patience stoutly resists pulling up the daisies to see how the roots are doing. Patience is never condescending or exclusive - it is never glad when others are left out. Patience never preens itself; it prefers keeping the window of the soul open.</p>
<p>I have struggled to find adequate words to express these concluding feelings and these thoughts about our need to be patient with ourselves and with our circumstances in this second estate.</p>
<p>Some of us have been momentarily wrenched by the sound of a train whistle spilling into the night air, and we have been inexplicably subdued by the mix of feelings that this evokes. Or perhaps we have been beckoned by a lighted cottage across a snow-covered meadow at dusk. Or we have heard the warm and drawing laughter of children at a nearby playground. Or we have been tugged at by the strains of congregational singing from a nearby church. Or we have encountered a particular fragrance which has awakened memories deep within us of things which once were. In such moments, we have felt a deep yearning, as if we were temporarily outside of something to which we actually belonged and of which we so much wanted again to be a part.</p>
<p>There are spiritual equivalents of these moments. Such seem to occur most often when time touches eternity. In these moments we feel a longing closeness - but we are still separate. The partition which produces this paradox is something we call the veil - a partition the presence of which requires our patience. We define the veil as the border between mortality and eternity; it is also a film of forgetting which covers the memories of earlier experiences. This forgetfulness will be lifted one day, and on that day we will see forever - rather than "through a glass, darkly" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12?lang=eng#p11">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).</p>
<p>There are poignant and frequent reminders of the veil, adding to our sense of being close but still outside. In our deepest prayers, when the agency of man encounters the omniscience of God, we sometimes sense, if only momentarily, how very provincial our petitions are; we perceive that there are more good answers than we have good questions; and we realize that we have been taught more than we can tell, for the language used is not that which the tongue can transmit.</p>
<p>We experience this same close separateness when a baby is born, but also as we wait with those who are dying - for then we brush against the veil, as goodbyes and greetings are said almost within earshot of each other. In such moments, this resonance with realities on the other side of the veil is so obvious that it can be explained in only one way!</p>
<p>No wonder the Savior said that His doctrines would be recognized by His sheep, that we would know His voice, that we would follow Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.14?lang=eng#p13">John 10:14</a>). We do not, therefore, follow strangers. Deep within us, His doctrines do strike the promised chord of familiarity and underscore our true identity. Our sense of belonging grows in spite of our sense of separateness; for His teachings stir our souls, awakening feelings within us which have somehow survived underneath the encrusting experiences of mortality.</p>
<p>This inner serenity which the believer knows as he brushes against the veil is cousin to certitude. The peace it brings surpasses our understanding and certainly our capacity to explain. But it requires a patience which stands in stark contrast to the restlessness of the world in which, said Isaiah, the wicked are like the pounding and troubled sea which cannot rest (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/57.20?lang=eng#p19">Isaiah 57:20</a>).</p>
<p>But mercifully the veil is there. It is fixed by the wisdom of God for our good. It is no use being impatient with the Lord over that reality, for it is clearly a condition to which we agreed so long ago. Even when the veil is parted briefly, it will be on His terms, not ours. Without the veil, we would lose that precious insulation which would constantly interfere with our mortal probation and maturation. Without the veil, our brief mortal walk in a darkening world would lose its meaning - for one would scarcely carry the flashlight of faith at noonday and in the presence of the Light of the World. Without the veil, we could not experience the gospel of work and the sweat of our brow. If we had the security of having already entered into Gods rest, certain things would be unneeded; Adam and Eve did not clutch social security cards in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>And how could we learn about obedience if we were shielded from the consequences of our disobedience? And how could we learn patience under pressure if we did not experience pressure and waiting? Nor could we choose for ourselves if we were already in His holy presence, for some alternatives do not there exist. Besides, Gods Court is filled with those who have patiently overcome - whose company we do not yet deserve.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the veil keeps the first, second, and third estates separate - hence our sense of separateness. The veil avoids having things &#8220;compound in one&#8221; to our everlasting detriment (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#p10">2 Nephi 2:11</a>). We are cocooned, as it were, in order that we might truly choose. Once, long ago, we chose to come to this very setting where we could choose. It was an irrevocable choice. And the veil is the guarantor that our ancient choice will be honored.</p>
<p>When the veil which encloses us is no more, time will also be no more (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.100?lang=eng#p99">D&amp;C 84:100</a>). Even now, time is clearly not our natural dimension. Thus it is that we are never really at home in time. Alternately, we find ourselves impatiently wishing to hasten the passage of time or to hold back the dawn. We can do neither, of course. Whereas the bird is at home in the air, we are clearly not at home in time - because we belong to eternity. Time, as much as any one thing, whispers to us that we are strangers here. If time were natural to us, why is it that we have so many clocks and wear wristwatches?</p>
<p>Thus the veil stands - not to shut us out forever, but to remind us of Gods tutoring and patient love for us. Any brush against the veil produces a feeling of "not yet," but also faint whispers of anticipation of that moment when, in the words of todays choral hymn, "Come, Let Us Anew," those who have prevailed "by the patience and hope and the labor of love" will hear the glorious words," Well and faithfully done; / Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne " (<i>Hymns</i>, number 17).</p>
<p>May each of us live for that special moment patiently and righteously, I pray in the name of Him who is so patient with me as I strive to be an "especial witness" for him in all the world, even Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am very grateful for the opportunity I have to speak with you today. I would like to begin with a scripture in Ecclesiastes 9:11:
The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. [emphasis added]
I ponder this scripture each time I have a conversation with someone who didnt get into the graduate program they applied to, doesnt know what job to take, came home from their mission early, or has had other unexpected experiences. As I listen to their stories, my mind returns to that scripture and the reality that "time and chance happeneth to [us] all."
Today I would like to explore this scripture with you, but I suggest that another way of talking about time and chance is to use the word uncertainty.
Uncertainty as a Core Human Experience
Though the sources of your uncertainty will likely differ from mine, I believe this scripture in Ecclesiastes speaks the truth. No one will be immune from uncertainty or from the struggle, questioning, heartache, and pain that may accompany it.
Uncertainty has many faces. It includes questions, doubts, ambiguity, and the discovery that persons (or things) are not quite what we expected. In essence, uncertainty is a reflection of the gap between our desire for the ideal and our experience of reality. The ideal represents how we think things ought to or should be; reality is how things actually are. Though we live our lives in the real world, our dreams and goals are often reflected in ideals. When we experience "a gap between the ideal and the real,"1 we experience uncertainty.
In some of my research I have studied this gap for women transitioning to parenthood. My colleagues and I have focused our attention on what new mothers thought their ideal work situations would be versus what their real work situations were. We defined work situations broadly, including opportunities to stay home, to combine work and family, or to combine school and family. The majority of the mothers in our sample (more than 70 percent) experienced a gap between what they believed to be ideal and what their actual work and family situation was.2 I tell you this to exemplify the claim in Ecclesiastes that "chance happeneth to them all."
Uncertainty Challenges Us
My colleagues and I also discovered that the greater the gap, the higher the likelihood that a mother would experience depression. I think this finding reflects something else about uncertainty: gaps between our ideals and our real circumstances challenge us. When reality hits or when things dont go as planned, we may struggle.
About two and a half years ago, after many years of hoping another child would come to our family, my husband and I discovered we were pre</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Using the literary technique of repetition and completion, the prophet Isaiah wrote this magnificent promise: "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint" (Isaiah 40:31). My text is guided today by this scriptural passage, drawing on personal and professional life experiences, other scriptural passages, and the words of the prophets.
Waiting upon the Lord: As a woman and a nurse researcher focusing on womens health, when I first think of the word waiting, I think of women bearing children. Old Testament Hannah spoke of her experience when she said, "For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him" (1 Samuel 1:27). Hannah waited upon the Lord. Patricia T. Holland has suggested that "women appreciate that word labor in a way that no man ever can" (Within Whispering Distance of Heaven: A Message for Mothers [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1989], p. 11). I believe this is so. For nine months a woman carries a child both beneath and within her heart. Waiting long months and then laboring long hours, she then gives birth.
Over the past decade my research has focused on the meaning of childbirth. I have listened to the birth stories of women living in North and Central America, Scandinavia, and the Middle East. What wonderful experiences have been mine. I have learned through interviewing women that there is a connectedness that transcends the barriers of language and culture when sacred experiences such as childbirth are shared. The pictures of my own children and grandchildren became dog-eared and worn from being held in so many womens hands as we shared our commonalities. I listened to "woman talk" sitting on worn, century-old wooden benches in maternal and child health clinics and on dirt floors in humble homes and in refugee camps. I sat among these women - women whose life circumstances are so different than my own - and listened. I see in my minds eye the Guatemalan women wearing brightly colored woven clothing, made by their own hands - creating beauty in stark contrast to the harshness and poverty of their life circumstances. I think of the Orthodox Jewish women, their hair covered in symbolism of their modesty before the Lord. Many of the Muslim women were robed and veiled, covered from head to toe in black as a symbol of their devotion to God. I think in contrast of Mormon women who have made temple covenants wearing the symbol of their devotion in sacred white clothing worn next to their skin.
In thousands of pages of transcribed narrative data, I found that women made sacred the experience of giving birth, supporting the thesis that there is deep meaning in womens ordinary and commonplace lives regardless of sociocultural context (see Sue Bender, Everyday Sacred: A Womans Journey Home</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a joyful noise comes from this congregation! It fills my heart with joy to be here with you, to sing the songs of Zion, and to hear your prayers and share in your spirit. How good you are! Your mothers probably tell you that, but I want to tell you, too. The members of the Church are blessed with the goodness of your generation.
The opening hymn was so appropriate for the first of January: "Come, let us anew our journey pursue, Roll round with the year, And never stand still till the Master appear" ("Come, Let Us Anew," Hymns, 1985, no. 217). As Latter-day Saints, those words have special meaning to us. They echo a theme about this journey of life that has characterized our entire dispensation: "No toil nor labor fear; But with joy wend your way" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints," Hymns, 1985, no. 30).
These stirring words inspired the early pioneer Saints who traveled west to find a sanctuary for religious freedom. This year, throughout the Church, we will observe the sesquicentennial of that great westward trek with a celebration that has been titled "Faith in Every Footstep." Today the headquarters of the Church is in the desert valleys the pioneers settled. It is also the setting for the 2002 Olympics and home to Brigham Young University. The spirit that characterized the pioneer era is very much a part of our lives today.
At the beginning of this new year, most of us have closed our journals on 1996 and opened new ones. Before us are blank pages to be filled in day by day as we each give shape to the year 1997. The first of January is usually marked by the tradition of making resolutions - the always well-intentioned list of what we are going to do differently in the months ahead.
A scripture in 1 Thessalonians can be a good guide for us in this process. In verse 3 the apostle Paul praises the Saints of Thessalonica: "Remembering without ceasing [their] work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in [the] Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thessalonians 1:3).
I like Pauls choice of words in commending those Saints. To me they speak as a powerful reminder of our need to set priorities and to center our work, labor, and patience of hope in Jesus Christ, to believe in him and in his ways enough to abandon selfish inclinations and develop direction in our spiritual journey.
This scripture makes some interesting connections. Work is tied to faith, labor is associated with love, and patience is woven in with hope. This juxtaposition points out that what we do is balanced by how we do it. The ordinary tasks of work, labor, and patience are transformed into faith, love, and hope in Jesus Christ when we realize that it is through these seemingly commonplace tasks that we bring glory to our Father.
In my message tonight I want to focus on the quality of patience. What kind of patience was Paul speaking of in this scripture? I dont think the praise was for st</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Im grateful to be with you tonight. And I appreciate what it means for you to have decided to spend your time with me. I watched you take your seats and wait. Id like to talk with you tonight about those two things: about time. And about waiting.
A Time to Every Purpose
I was riding in a car with a wise man a few years ago. We talked about some tragedies in lives of people we knew. Some had waited too long, missing the chance to act. And some had waited not long enough. He said quietly, more to himself than to me, "Timing is everything."
Ecclesiastes said, with an elegance that goes beyond poetry to frame our problem:
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.
And then later:
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away. [Ecclesiastes 3:12, 6]
Waiting for a harvest takes more judgment in life than it does in gardening. In your garden, you can tell if the seed sprouts. And even an amateur can tell when the corn or carrots are ready. But I remember a story told to me long ago, far from here, by a sad voice. I remember it not because it was unique but because I have heard the same story told, again and again, about waiting or failing to wait. The details vary, but not the feeling of drama.
She said it happened on a summer Saturday afternoon. She was tired. Tired of being single. Tired of trying to be a faithful Latter-day Saint. Not so much tired of being kind and virtuous as tired of nothing good seeming to come of it. Shed not had a date in months.
She saw no prospect of even becoming friends with, let alone marrying, a man who shared her faith and ideals. In frustration she found herself deciding something. She decided that afternoon, consciously, that years of good works and restraint had produced too little and promised no more. She said to herself almost aloud, "Oh, whats the use?"
The phone rang. It was a mans voice, a man she knew. He lived in the same apartment building. Hed asked her out before. Shed refused because she was sure hed expect her to compromise her standards shed preserved at great effort. But, almost as if directed by a scriptwriter, he called at that instant.
She didnt say, "Yes." She said, "Ill think about it." She thought about it. He called again. And finally, she repeated to herself, "Oh, whats the use?" She went. She found she had been right about his intentions. And in a choice about time and about waiting or not waiting, her life changed. So, she will never know what might have been ahead on the path she decided wasnt worth the price; she knew quickly the other one was uphill, and a hard climb.
All of us make decisions every day, almost every hour, about whether its </span>
