  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="I am truly  grateful for this recognition. And thanks to all of you for your presence here today, especially to  my family to whom I owe so much. I’m glad my brother Jim could play the organ today. He and I were  roommates in Helaman Halls in 1968. With great talents, he is a brother I have always looked up to.  Also, it is fun to be able to address you here in the de Jong Concert Hall. I remember ushering here  as a freshman in 1964. My wife, Jeannie, and I have many good memories of dates and events here in  this building. I’m so glad that she and I have been able to share such an abundant life  together.

Concerning this award, let me note that we are currently celebrating several 50th  jubilee anniversaries: of BYU Studies, of the BYU Honors Program, and of the Harold B. Lee Library.  This year is also the King James Version’s 400th anniversary (its eighth jubilee) and Mormon’s  1,600th birthday (his 32nd jubilee)—all of these representing huge parts of my life. So, I count it  as a special privilege to be added as the 50th recipient to the list of this award’s previous  designees, who include many of my teachers, mentors, role models, and senior colleagues. In addition  to our family trees, we also have our intellectual genealogies, made up of people who have forged  the roots and filled out the branches of our minds, interests, ideals, and testimonies. How  fortunate we are for such influences in our lives.

What a challenge it has been to prepare  this talk! As this talk has developed and changed, it has also changed me. At times like this, words  simply fail. Preparing this talk has made me more grateful than ever for BYU. This university is a  beacon on a hill that cannot be hid. Its influence will go forth to bring to pass much goodness and  righteousness.

As I puzzled over what to say, I felt directed to reread the BYU Mission  Statement.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I have read this statement many times over the years, though probably not  often enough. I now see it as something like a patriarchal blessing for the university. As I looked  at it and at my 31 years on the faculty, I felt like the boy in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story of  the old man of the mountain&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as it dawned on me how closely my experiences and desires  have come to track the contours of this mission statement. While that statement is not holy  scripture, I hope it’s okay for a true-blue Cougar to bear testimony that the BYU Mission Statement  is good and true. I believe it was inspired. It was drafted in 1981, in short order, at a quiet  mountain retreat, by the recently installed BYU president Jeffery R. Holland.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; It was  tweaked only a little and then approved without hesitation by the Board of Trustees, led by  President Spencer W. Kimball. As an overriding take-home message for you from my remarks today, it  would be: “Follow this mission statement.” You can find it on the BYU website. Take any line in it,  and it will bless your intellectual life with perspective and purpose.

My title, “Thy  Mind, O Man, Must Stretch,” comes from the poignant letter dictated by Joseph Smith from the dungeon  of Liberty Jail (that so-called temple-prison that was more often prison than temple). The Prophet  revealed these words almost five months into his miserable and legally unjustifiable detention  there. After counseling the Church to avoid pride and trifling conversations, the Prophet burst  beyond the walls of his surroundings with these expansive words:

&lt;i&gt;The things of God  are of deep import, and time and experience and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only  find them out. Thy mind, O Man &lt;/i&gt;[and we may add O Woman as well],&lt;i&gt; if thou wilt lead a soul  unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost Heavens, and search into and contemplate the  lowest considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand upon the broad considerations of eternal  expanse; he must commune with God. How much more dignified&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and noble are the thoughts of God,  than the vain imaginations of the human heart, none but fools will trifle with the souls of  men.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Altogether, these expansive words reward deep reflection. Here  is a most compelling mandate for a broad BYU education and a lifetime of learning. Joseph’s  prophetic words impel, to the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;th degree, all who are not just scholars who happen to be  Mormons, but Mormons who happen to be scholars.

Being a part of Mormon scholarship at BYU  has been a perpetually rewarding, mind-expanding experience for me. There is nothing closed-minded  about being a true Latter-day Saint. With the Holy Ghost, you will never get a “disk full” warning.  Every year there have been new and amazing discoveries.

You might wonder: So, how does  this happen? How does one’s mind expand to see or discover new things? In this acceptance speech  today, I thought it would be appropriate to try to explain how this has worked for me personally,  and, as I know, for many others as well. Actually, saying how any discovery happens is a pretty tall  order, because most discoveries are not planned or orchestrated. They often come as flashes of  inspiration or, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, “as . . . moved upon by the Holy Ghost” (D&amp;amp;C  68:3). But whenever they happen, especially when they involve seeing some new extension or  application of gospel truth, the moment is unmistakable, bringing an abiding sense of joy and  satisfaction.

Consider these lines from a &lt;i&gt;Peanuts&lt;/i&gt; comic strip. Charlie Brown, Lucy,  and Linus are lying on a hillside looking up at the clouds. Lucy asks, “What do you think you see,  Linus?”

Linus says, “Well, those clouds up there look to me like the map of the British  Honduras on the Caribbean. That cloud up there looks a little like the profile of Thomas Eakins, the  famous painter and sculptor. And that group of clouds over there gives me the impression of the  stoning of Stephen. I can see the Apostle Paul standing there to one side.”

Lucy says,  “That’s very good,” and asks Charlie Brown, “What do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; see?”

He answers, “Well, I  was going to say I saw a ducky and a horsie, but I changed my mind!”

What might help us to  see like Linus? The first thing is to be looking, purposefully and constructively, for something of  value. The mind expands by recognition, or re-cognizing. Seeing in one thing something that is  faintly reminiscent of something else that is higher, deeper, or of greater substance is the  beginning of knowing and not just observing. Connecting and seeing recurring patterns, such as those  with which the gospel is replete, is the beginning of discernment and the development of potentially  meaningful relationships.

For example, one day as my wife and I were visiting Chartres  Cathedral, we listened to a guide explain a stained-glass window that had 12 scenes depicting the  parable of the Good Samaritan on the bottom and 12 scenes telling the story of Adam and Eve on the  top.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; This pairing, which struck me at first as very odd, turned out to spawn meaningful  connections at every point, not with just a single act of kindness but with the broad pattern of the  eternal plan of salvation. In this context the man who goes down from Jerusalem, a holy place, and  falls among robbers, represents the Fall of Adam and Eve and of all mankind, as we all have come  down from our heavenly home and have fallen among the forces of evil. The Good Samaritan, who saves  the injured man, represents the Savior, who comes, has compassion, and alone is able to save all who  have been left half dead, having suffered the first but not yet the second death. He anoints with  oil, washes wounds with his wine, binds us, and promises to return a second time. But the initial  burst of connective insight is just the beginning of the discovery process. Extensive reading,  pondering, and lots of work soon yielded further insights and even found that this understanding of  the gospel of Jesus Christ was evidenced in this long-lost line of allegorical Christian  interpretation stretching back at least as far as the second century  A.D.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Indeed, most discoveries require lots of hard work. As a tax lawyer in  Los Angeles, I repeatedly saw the value of the Mormon commitment to hard work. In one case, I  represented movie star Burt Reynolds. A tax issue over whether he was a California or a Florida  resident had arisen, and his case hung in the balance. People had been over the documents many  times. A couple days before our hearing in Sacramento, I decided to double-check everything. I even  went back over Burt’s appointment books to see if any detail might have been missed. And there it  was: every year Burt was always in Florida on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Well, I walked into  the hearing humming “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.” The legal issue of residency, after all, is all  about where home is. I introduced this new fact into the record, and the state asked for a recess.  When they returned, they dropped the case. The point of this little story is simply that I was glad  to have gone the extra mile.

Indeed, most academic discoveries come after poring over  materials again and again. The mind expands by hard work over sustained stretches. Thus, the first  paragraph of the BYU Mission Statement emphasizes that a BYU education demands “a period of  intensive learning” with a high “commitment to excellence.” Our BYU way of doing things  enthusiastically embraces work. There are no shortcuts to good scholarship. Brilliant ideas remain  mere figments until they are verbalized, embodied in images, and brought to life. In Joseph Smith’s  words, this takes “time and experience and careful and ponderous . . . thoughts.”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; We  learn best by strenuous effort. I remember vividly my student days at BYU, at Oxford, and at Duke,  because those experiences were so intense; they indelibly seared words and ideas upon my mind. Think  of how much you have learned in accelerated courses, in the compressed MTC experience, during  intense travel abroad, or by competing under pressure-packed circumstances. A Mormon motto is “We do  hard things.” Do not shy away from hard work, from long course assignments, or from demanding  challenges, for work precedes the aha moment.

But hard work alone is also not enough. It  is possible to exert endless energy spinning one’s wheels. To expand our understanding, we must  formulate more precise, potentially answerable questions and then keep searching, believing that an  answer is out there somewhere, giving the scriptures credence, suspending judgment, giving God the  benefit of the doubt, praying every day for His guidance, trusting that He knows the answer, that it  can somehow make sense, and not presuming that the answer must necessarily come out your way. What  we are looking for is frequently going to be found outside of the box. Sometimes the answer is “none  of the above” or “all of the above.”

Under its second bullet point, the BYU Mission  Statement speaks of “the pursuit” of truth. It doesn’t speak of “inventing” or “voting on” truth,  but rather of “pursuing” truth. We expand our knowledge by looking for things, pursuing things that  exist beyond our current understanding. How can one logically pursue something that one assumes does  not exist? As former BYU academic vice president Robert K. Thomas said, “Skeptics—by  definition—cannot affirm anything, even their own skepticism.”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Thus, discoveries that  have given me the greatest satisfaction have begun by assuming the correctness of a text, the  truthfulness of a proposition, or the wisdom of an instruction given by one in  authority.

In a recent e-mail, Terry Warner, one of my philosophy mentors and the creator  of the &lt;i&gt;Education in Zion&lt;/i&gt; exhibit here on campus, spoke of what he sees as the astonishing  momentum that has been developed in Mormon studies by many first-rate scholars here at BYU. He  said:

&lt;i&gt;I have wondered whether the first dislodged stone, in what is becoming  almost an avalanche of scholarship, was not Nibley’s gutsy determination to see what could be made  of the available historical evidence by assuming (at least the possibility of) the truth of LDS  claims, rather than by assuming their falsehood. . . . It was Leibniz who insisted that one cannot  adequately understand the meaning of a proposition without assuming its  truth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

Of course, the scientific method rightly propounds a  hypothesis and then tries to invalidate it; but still the hypothesis is not considered false  &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it has been found to have failed. There is something wrong—as much in academic halls  as in courtrooms—about assuming something or someone to be guilty until proven  innocent.

As an example, when I began teaching a course on ancient laws in the Book of  Mormon, I ran across the case of Seantum, the man who secretly stabbed his brother seated on the  judgment seat and was detected by Nephi’s prophecy in Helaman 8–9. Since there were no witnesses,  how could Seantum be executed under the law of Moses, which required two or three witnesses in order  to convict? Rather than sadly conceding that there must be an embarrassing blunder here, I continued  studying more about ancient Hebrew law, only to learn quite unexpectedly at a Jewish law conference  that an ancient exception to the two-witness rule, which was traced in rabbinic law as far back as  Joshua 7, allowed that the two-witness rule could be satisfied if the culprit confessed voluntarily  outside of court or if God’s hand was involved in the detection of the offender and if corroborating  physical evidence (such as blood on the skirts of his cloak) was found. As it turns out, the Book of  Mormon goes out of its way to report these very points. The case against Seantum is not an  embarrassment but remarkably sound.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

When we come up against things that seem  out of sorts or nonsensical, our critical instincts lure us into thinking that there must be  something wrong. But a special joy attaches to the discovery of a new insight that began with the  thought that something was wrong but turned out to be right. It’s the joy of finally seeing an odd  little puzzle piece snap into place in the bigger picture. It’s the joy that comes from the great  gospel principle of reversal: that by small things come great purposes; that the Lord’s ways are not  always the world’s ways (see Isaiah 55:8); that the poor are rich; and that those who lose their  lives for Christ’s sake will be the ones who will ultimately find eternal joy (see Matthew  10:39).

So, I go on high alert when I notice interesting anomalies, which are often clues  of something going on below the surface. Truth will be found in odd places, as high and low and  broad as the eternal expanse, as Joseph said. Moses’ mind was certainly stretched by the amazing  things he saw in unexpected places, which things he had never supposed (see Moses 1:10). No one was  more surprised by what Joseph Smith was told in his First Vision than was he himself. It was not at  all what he was expecting.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;

Recently, reading on a plane to Portland, Oregon,  I noticed something unexpected in the hardly ever mentioned parable of the two sons in Matthew 21.  After Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the chief priests approached Him in the temple and  demanded: “By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?” (Matthew  21:23). Jesus answered by telling a story about a certain man who had two sons. When asked to go  down and work in the vineyard, the first son initially refused, but then he went, while the other  initially said yes but then does not go, or so it seems (see Matthew 21:28–30). This parable may be  useful in parenting, and it can be read at that level; but remember, that’s not what Jesus was asked  about. With the question of authority in mind, as I read this parable in the Greek, something jumped  off the page at me. Think about it: When did a certain father have two sons, One who went and the  other who did not? When did the First (the Firstborn) say, “&lt;i&gt;Ou thelo&lt;/i&gt;,” which in Greek means  “I will it not,” or “I’d rather not,” or “it is not my &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;.” As the Greek continues, that  Son reconciled Himself (not repented Himself) and went. In contrast, the “other” (the  &lt;i&gt;heteros&lt;/i&gt;) son simply said, “&lt;i&gt;Ego&lt;/i&gt;,” meaning “I.” But I &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;? Readers must fill in  this blank. In this verse, the word &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt; in the King James Version is italicized, because it  has only been implied there. One might as well supply other words: “I . . . will have it my way,” or  “I . . . will get the glory.” In any event, this egotistic son did not go. As Latter-day Saints, we  can easily but unexpectedly see at this deeper level how this unassuming little parable answers the  all-important questions about Jesus’ authority. He received it from the Father in the Council in  Heaven when He was commissioned to go down and do, not His will, but the will of the  Father.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Believing that God has revealed and yet will reveal many great and  important things commits us to approach some things differently from the rest of the world, and for  me that’s okay. There will always be worldly things that will make it difficult to be a Latter-day  Saint by making some Mormon beliefs objectionable, frustrating, or awkward. And we won’t always have  all the answers to these difficulties, certainly not the moment they first arise. But this too  invites further stretching and expansion. Our ongoing task as Latter-day Saints is to locate  defensible answers that are also consistent with our scriptures, doctrines, and assumptions and to  understand how opposing views often depend principally upon other fundamentally different  assumptions.

For example, the Mormon point of view sees work differently from the world,  because we know that God Himself has a work, and it is His glory; and we affirm, by our actions,  that faith without works is dead (see Moses 1:39; James 2:26).

We also see ethics quite  differently because, for us, humans are not disconnected creatures with whom we selectively enter  into social contracts, but all are related to us, as members of our premortal family.&lt;a href=&quot;http://lds.org/family/proclamation?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  That expansive factor transforms the foundations of ethics and the meaning of  ethnicity.

We see moral agency differently. As President Hinckley taught, false freedom is  freedom to do what one likes; true freedom is freedom to do what one  ought.&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

We see history differently. The reality of the Apostasy shows that the  fittest don’t always survive.

We see power differently, because we take seriously the  scriptural curse placed on anyone who misuses power for glory or gain, and we know that the greatest  must be the servants of all (D&amp;amp;C 121:36–39; Matt. 23:11). Because of this, we do not share the  common animus against hierarchy and authority.

We see issues of gender equality  differently. The secular world would collapse equality into sameness. But equality does not mean  identity.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Four plus four and two plus six are different, but both are equal to  eight.

At BYU we have the constant opportunity to bring many Mormon insights to bear on  scholarly topics and just as much to bring scholarly perspectives to bear on topics of importance to  Latter-day Saints. If we think there isn’t a Mormon point of view on any subject, it may well be  that we haven’t yet looked high or deep or wide enough.

With stretching the mind comes an  openness to embrace more. The BYU Mission Statement speaks of the pursuit of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; truth. Our  desire is for further light and understanding, to circumscribe all truth. To me, Mormonism thrives  because it welcomes the idea that the world is fundamentally pluralistic by nature. Over and over,  the Mormon worldview relishes multiplicity. Words found traditionally only in the singular are  boldly spoken of as plurals in Mormon doctrine: we speak of priesthoods, intelligences, noble and  great ones, two creations, worlds without number, continuing revelations, scriptures, covenants,  degrees of glory, eternal lives, saviors on Mt. Zion, and even gods. Joseph Smith spoke of there  being many kingdoms and that “unto every kingdom is given [its own] law,” and “all truth is  independent in that sphere in which God has placed it” (D&amp;amp;C 88:38, 93:30). To me, such  statements of cosmological relativities unleash and transfigure the concepts of natural law and  eternal truths.&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

It took a century for the world to even begin to catch up  with this expansive notion revealed by Joseph Smith. For example, I am fascinated by the  implications of Gödel’s 1931 incompleteness theorem, which demonstrates that a system can be either  complete or consistent, but not both.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, systematic theologies or rational  philosophies may well be internally consistent, but they do so at the expense of completeness. Sets  and abstractions may be helpful, but they are simply extractions of selected elements of otherwise  messy realities. Mormon thought, in contrast, privileges fullness, abundance, completeness, and all  that the Father has, even if that means that Mormon life becomes joyously overloaded or torn by  competing pressures that pull, stretch, and expand us in many ways. This may produce episodes of  cognitive dissonance, social quandaries, mystery, and uncertainty, but if forced to choose, Mormon  thought will always prefer openness over closedness, boldly inviting further growth, progression,  and—fortunately for us in academia—further questions.

This dynamic view has certainly  influenced my legal thinking. Over the years I have taught classes about corporations, partnerships,  and other organizations that are all managed by various kinds of officers, trustees, and  administrators. The law holds these people to standards called fiduciary duties. Despite thousands  of cases, the law hasn’t addressed the question of what makes one fiduciary duty high and another  low. But in our complex world, one size does not fit all. Thinking more expansively, Professor Brett  Scharffs and I have identified a set of factors that reveal whether a fiduciary duty is high,  medium, or low and what degree of duty is required of fiduciaries in all kinds of  settings.&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Thinking this way may seem obvious enough to you as a Latter-day Saint, since  you already believe that there will be varying degrees of treatment and glory for every person  according to their individual deeds and circumstances. But recent events in the corporate world show  how much in need we are of a more robust legal approach to the duties owed by people in positions of  greatest trust.

Concerning duties, let me mention one other part of this subject that has  occupied much of my thought in the last decade.&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Because we know that there must be an  opposition in all things, LDS thought often harmonizes traditional paradoxes. The world has fought  wars over whether we are saved by faith or by works. We peacefully say, “Both.” People argue over  whether we come to know by study or by faith. We confidently say, “Both.” “Each of us must  accommodate the mixture of reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but  &lt;i&gt;requires&lt;/i&gt; it,” President Boyd K. Packer has said.&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_say-unto-one/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the same way, Mormon thought  brings together both rights and duties. Rights and duties go hand in glove with each other, for with  all rights come duties. I think this is because with all rights come powers and privileges, and with  powers and privileges come duties. As Latter-day Saints, again, we intuitively sense this, for we  know that all who have been warned have the duty to warn their neighbors (D&amp;amp;C 88:81), that with  greater knowledge comes greater stewardship and accountability, and that “Because I have been given  much, I too must give.”&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;

But this is decidedly not the way people usually  think about rights. The world usually thinks that, because I have a right, someone else has a duty,  namely to protect or fulfill my right. While that is true enough, at the same time, if I claim a  right, power, or privilege, I also acquire a duty as its necessary flip  side.&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;

I have no doubt that the 20th century will go down in history as the  century of rights: voting rights, workers’ rights, civil rights, human rights, privacy rights,  disability rights, and many more. With these rights in place, I can only hope that the 21st century  will someday go down in history as the century of duties: civic duties, human duties, fiduciary  duties, religious duties, environmental duties, and duties to future generations. I yearn for the  day when we will have a Bill of Duties to go with our Bill of Rights. As world resources become  scarcer, and as all nations, tongues, and peoples become more vulnerably interdependent, the idea of  individual rights will necessarily change. How many rights can the world support without all people  assuming commensurate duties? The point is not to take rights away but to recognize the duties that  are inherent in those very privileges.

Speaking of privileges, we in the academic world  are certainly among the most privileged. We enjoy the extraordinary blessings of time to read,  think, write, listen, and talk about things we love. With those blessings, one would have thought,  would also come a great awareness of our responsibilities. As Joseph said, “None but fools will  trifle with the souls of [others].”&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, as Stanford President Donald Kennedy wrote in  1997, “The responsibility of the professoriate is a difficult subject about which surprisingly  little has been said,”&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; and that serious defect still remains inexcusably  unaddressed.

I am pleased that we at BYU Studies have adopted a code of academic  duties.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; This multidisciplinary LDS quarterly journal is open to all authors and  readers. Its code draws on scriptural mandates, hoping to encourage among LDS scholars such things  as unity (“if ye are not one ye are not mine” [D&amp;amp;C 38:27]); charity (for if we have not charity,  we are nothing [see 1 Corinthians 13:2]); edification (the goal is to be spiritually and  intellectually upbuilding); and honesty and integrity (for accuracy and reliability are the essence  of scholarship). And, by the way, it’s all right, like Charlie Brown, to see a ducky and a horsie,  if that’s what you honestly see.

As President Monson has often said, duty basically means  charitably putting other people ahead of one’s own self-interests.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/do-your-duty-that-is-best?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our minds stretch  the farthest when they are pure and actively concerned about the welfare of others. Unselfishness is  what allows the mind to stretch without snapping. Thus, for good reason, the BYU Mission Statement  again stretches us to know as much as possible, not only about our own culture but also about the  cultures of others. It is rightly said that he who knows only one culture knows no  culture.

I like the way George Handley, an associate editor of BYU Studies, sees this. He  writes, “My discovery [has been] that listening carefully to other voices and other cultures doesn’t  have to involve sacrificing our values,” but rather helps me to understand better my own  “Mormonness.”&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;

As Brigham Young charged the elders going out into the world,  he said: “Whether a truth be found with professed infidels, . . . or the Church of Rome, . . . it is  the [duty] of the Elders of this Church . . . to gather up all the truths in the world pertaining to  life and salvation, to the Gospel we preach, to mechanism of every kind, to the sciences, and to  philosophy, wherever it may be found . . . and bring it to Zion.”&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;

Indeed, it  was from a Catholic Jesuit that I first learned about chiasmus&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; and from a Jewish  barrister that I learned about the ancient legal difference between thieves and  robbers.&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; And, by the way, both of those scholars were genuinely glad to see in the Book  of Mormon these things that they had found in Hebraic settings.

As Latter-day Saints we  certainly understand the benefits of learning from others and reaching out to collaborate with  others. Our experiences in councils and presidencies instill in us a sociality that easily carries  over into our way of doing scholarship. Identify a project, assemble the right team, and see what  you can accomplish. Team victories magnify the thrill. Among the best memories of my academic life  are many team efforts, such as Macmillan’s&lt;i&gt;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&lt;/i&gt; with Dan Ludlow’s team  of eight hundred contributors.&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; I am now thrilled to be working on the legal team of the  vital Joseph Smith Papers Project.&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; We now know that Joseph was distracted by over 200  lawsuits in his lifetime, and their documentary records are astonishingly more complex than any one  person can sort out. Two or three lawsuits are usually enough to overwhelm most men, but Joseph  succeeded by working collaboratively and expansively with numerous associates, including the Holy  Ghost as his regular companion.

Well, our time is nearly gone, and we’ve only scratched  the surface of the BYU Mission Statement. I intend no disregard of any word in it. Equally important  to me are its dozens of other vital elements, upon which we could equally expand: assisting  individuals in realizing their full human potential; staging a variety of extracurricular  experiences; preparing people to meet personal and family challenges; competing with the best in  each field; making scholarly resources available to the Church when asked; loving God  devoutly;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speeches.byu.edu/posts/never-good-enough/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the living prophets, and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to  all—in other words, no child of God left behind. If nothing else, I hope my comments today have  opened up some intriguing possibilities for you to think about.

In the end the BYU Mission  Statement calls on us to “have a strong effect on the course of higher education” and to “be an  influence in a world we wish to improve.” In this, our uniqueness can be an asset. As mediators  between competing views, we can offer alternative solutions. And we need not be reluctant. We have  all been electrified this season by Jimmer Fredette’s incredible, dramatic long shots. The sign I  liked the best was “Jimmer’s in range when he steps off the bus.” Mormon thought is also capable of  hitting a stunning array of intellectual long shots, doing things that traditional Western thinkers  have said cannot be done. Everywhere you turn, Joseph’s words hit the mark. He was in range every  time he opened his mouth.

In a book now at press with Oxford, Stephen Webb, a non-LDS  professor of religion, writes of Mormonism: “No other religious movement lies so close to  traditional Christianity. . . . Mormon theology is Christology unbound. . . . Of all the branches of  Christianity, Mormonism is the most imaginative, and if nothing else, its intellectual audacity  should make it the most exciting conversational partner for traditional Christians for the  twenty-first century.”&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;

I know that we can accomplish the goals of the BYU  Mission Statement. Like many other Latter-day Saints, I have spoken to various academic groups, with  their respect and genuine interest. After one paper I gave to a meeting of the Jewish Law  Association in Boston,&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; an older rabbi congratulated me and said, “Very, very good, but  why does a &lt;i&gt;goyyim&lt;/i&gt; [a Gentile] have to show us these things in our own Torah!” After a paper I  presented on ritual theory and temple themes in the Sermon on the Mount,&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; of all the  comments I received, I was most gratified by this one: “I have been attending these conferences for  30 years. You, for the first time, brought the Spirit into the room.” Latter-day Saints can indeed  be an influence in a world we wish to improve.

So, let us rejoice! Shall we not, each in  our own way, go on in so great a cause? The point is to come to think more as God thinks and to see  His children and this creation more as He does. The more we become like that, the more the stone  face on the mountain of the Lord, that stone that some builders have refused, can become the head of  the corner and that image can be received in our countenances.

We need not be ashamed of  the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was truly a prophet. The scriptures are true and  in them we find our way. The expansiveness of the truth invites us to venture forward, as high and  as deep and as broad as our minds may go. Thy mind, O man, must stretch. Indeed, it can and will  stretch, if you will lead a soul (including your own) unto salvation and will commune with God, that  our joy may be full and abundant, in time and all eternity. For your thoughtful attention and  goodness, I thank you very, very much.

Brigham  Young University Mission Statement

The mission of Brigham Young University—founded, supported,  and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—is to assist individuals in their  quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning  in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of  human potential is pursued.

All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide  variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced  development of the total person. Such a broadly prepared individual will not only be capable of  meeting personal challenge and change but will also bring strength to others in the tasks of home  and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.

To succeed in  this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets and sustained  by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God. In that  environment these four major educational goals should prevail:

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;All  students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is  inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can  be saved. Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and  a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Because the  gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth, students at BYU should receive a broad university  education. The arts, letters, and sciences provide the core of such an education, which will help  students think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural  tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual  integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;In addition to a strong general education, students should also  receive instruction in the special fields of their choice. The university cannot provide programs in  all possible areas of professional or vocational work, but in those it does provide the preparation  must be excellent. Students who graduate from BYU should be capable of competing with the best in  their fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty  and students, including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence, are essential and  will be encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

In meeting these objectives BYU’s faculty, staff,  students, and administrators should be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide. In an era of  limited enrollments, BYU can continue to expand its influence both by encouraging programs that are  central to the Church’s purposes and by making its resources available to the Church when called  upon to do so.

We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a  strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University’s  influence in a world we wish to improve.

&lt;i&gt;—Approved by the BYU Board of  TrusteesNovember 4, 1981&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appendix B&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
BYU Studies Author Guidelines: Article  Submissions

&lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt; strives to explore scholarly perspectives on LDS topics.  Contributions from all fields of learning are invited. &lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt; strives to publish  articles that openly reflect a Latter-day Saint point of view and are obviously relevant to subjects  of general interest to Latter-day Saints, while conforming to high scholarly standards. &lt;i&gt;BYU  Studies&lt;/i&gt; seeks articles that document or analyze, in a scholarly manner, topics related to LDS  history, culture, society, art, language, literature, science, thought, or experience. Short studies  and research involving significant historical documents are also welcomed.

&lt;i&gt;BYU  Studies&lt;/i&gt; is dedicated to the correlation of revealed and discovered truth and to the conviction  that the spiritual and the intellectual can be complementary and fundamentally harmonious avenues of  knowledge. All who venture to write for &lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt;should morally confront certain  responsibilities that may be said to comprise a sort of academic code of professional conduct. Some  important components of such a code would embrace at least the following  precepts.

&lt;b&gt;Unity. &lt;/b&gt;The Lord has clearly stated: “If ye are not one ye are not mine”  (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). In a shifting world that necessarily and fortunately features diversity,  individuality, heterodoxy, and change, the goal of unity with God and our fellow beings must be  continually cultivated and nourished. The goal of unity does not imply that all scholarly methods or  personal views must be the same.

&lt;b&gt;Harmony.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt; is committed to  seeking truth “by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). It proceeds on the premise that faith  and reason, revelation and scholarly learning, obedience and creativity are compatible. Traditional  dichotomies such as mind and body, God and man, spirit and matter, time and eternity, are not viewed  in the gospel of Jesus Christ as competing opposites. The objective is to embrace both: ancient and  modern, word and deed, intellectual and spiritual, research and teaching, reason and revelation, the  “ought” and the “is,” community and individuality, male and female, nature and custom, induction and  deduction, analysis and synthesis, rights and duties, subjectivity and objectivity, theory and  practice, even mortality and godhood. We can grow beyond issues over which is greater, the spirit or  the intellect. As Elder Boyd K. Packer has stated, “Each of us must accommodate the mixture of  reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but &lt;i&gt;requires&lt;/i&gt;  it.”

&lt;b&gt;Honesty.&lt;/b&gt; As a primary trait of character, “we believe in being honest”  (Articles of Faith 1:13). Accuracy and reliability are of the essence of scholarship. All scholars  worth their salt have wrestled long with the questions of what can and cannot, what should and  should not, what must or must not be said. They acknowledge and evaluate data both for and against  their ideas and theories. They eschew all forms of plagiarism and generously recognize their  indebtedness to other scholars. They guard on all sides against the covert influences of unstated  assumptions, bias, and esoteric terminology. They avoid material omissions, for often what is not  said can be as misleading as what is said.

&lt;b&gt;Thoroughness.&lt;/b&gt; “If there is anything  virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things” (Articles of Faith  1:13). &lt;i&gt;BYU Studies&lt;/i&gt; welcomes contributions from all disciplines,  addressing

&lt;i&gt;all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for  you to understand;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth;  things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are  at home, things which are abroad, . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That ye may be prepared in all things when  I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C  88:78–80]

&lt;b&gt;Humility.&lt;/b&gt; Pride has been identified as the pervading sin of our  day. As scholars we have more than our share of exposure to this problem. Arrogance, disdain,  overconfidence, dogmatism, and many other manifestations of intellectual and spiritual pride may  well be the main occupational hazards of academia. But the perspectives of scholarship and the  gospel can also provide the antidote. First is the acknowledgement that all people are at different  stages in the eternal journey toward the glory of God, which is intelligence. Second is the humble  awareness that scholarship is not an end in itself. Research cannot create faith; it can only set  the stage for greater light and knowledge.

&lt;b&gt;Charity.&lt;/b&gt; In order for communication to  occur, there must be charity, for no statement exists (including this one) that cannot be  misconstrued. If fellowship and goodwill do not exist, especially in an academic setting, we will  not communicate with one another. Paul’s confession comes to mind: “Though I have the gift of  prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge . . . and have not charity, I am nothing”  (1 Corinthians 13:2). Charity is also necessary to avoid offending even the weakest of the Saints.  Jesus said:

&lt;i&gt;It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through  whom they come!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his  neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.&lt;/i&gt; [Luke  17:1–2]" />

			<p>I am truly  grateful for this recognition. And thanks to all of you for your presence here today, especially to  my family to whom I owe so much. I’m glad my brother Jim could play the organ today. He and I were  roommates in Helaman Halls in 1968. With great talents, he is a brother I have always looked up to.  Also, it is fun to be able to address you here in the de Jong Concert Hall. I remember ushering here  as a freshman in 1964. My wife, Jeannie, and I have many good memories of dates and events here in  this building. I’m so glad that she and I have been able to share such an abundant life  together.</p>
<p>Concerning this award, let me note that we are currently celebrating several 50th  jubilee anniversaries: of BYU Studies, of the BYU Honors Program, and of the Harold B. Lee Library.  This year is also the King James Version’s 400th anniversary (its eighth jubilee) and Mormon’s  1,600th birthday (his 32nd jubilee)—all of these representing huge parts of my life. So, I count it  as a special privilege to be added as the 50th recipient to the list of this award’s previous  designees, who include many of my teachers, mentors, role models, and senior colleagues. In addition  to our family trees, we also have our intellectual genealogies, made up of people who have forged  the roots and filled out the branches of our minds, interests, ideals, and testimonies. How  fortunate we are for such influences in our lives.</p>
<p>What a challenge it has been to prepare  this talk! As this talk has developed and changed, it has also changed me. At times like this, words  simply fail. Preparing this talk has made me more grateful than ever for BYU. This university is a  beacon on a hill that cannot be hid. Its influence will go forth to bring to pass much goodness and  righteousness.</p>
<p>As I puzzled over what to say, I felt directed to reread the BYU Mission  Statement.<sup>1</sup> I have read this statement many times over the years, though probably not  often enough. I now see it as something like a patriarchal blessing for the university. As I looked  at it and at my 31 years on the faculty, I felt like the boy in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story of  the old man of the mountain<sup>2</sup> as it dawned on me how closely my experiences and desires  have come to track the contours of this mission statement. While that statement is not holy  scripture, I hope it’s okay for a true-blue Cougar to bear testimony that the BYU Mission Statement  is good and true. I believe it was inspired. It was drafted in 1981, in short order, at a quiet  mountain retreat, by the recently installed BYU president Jeffery R. Holland.<sup>3</sup> It was  tweaked only a little and then approved without hesitation by the Board of Trustees, led by  President Spencer W. Kimball. As an overriding take-home message for you from my remarks today, it  would be: “Follow this mission statement.” You can find it on the BYU website. Take any line in it,  and it will bless your intellectual life with perspective and purpose.</p>
<p>My title, “Thy  Mind, O Man, Must Stretch,” comes from the poignant letter dictated by Joseph Smith from the dungeon  of Liberty Jail (that so-called temple-prison that was more often prison than temple). The Prophet  revealed these words almost five months into his miserable and legally unjustifiable detention  there. After counseling the Church to avoid pride and trifling conversations, the Prophet burst  beyond the walls of his surroundings with these expansive words:</p>
<p><i>The things of God  are of deep import, and time and experience and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only  find them out. Thy mind, O Man </i>[and we may add O Woman as well],<i> if thou wilt lead a soul  unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost Heavens, and search into and contemplate the  lowest considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand upon the broad considerations of eternal  expanse; he must commune with God. How much more dignified</i> <i>and noble are the thoughts of God,  than the vain imaginations of the human heart, none but fools will trifle with the souls of  men.</i><sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Altogether, these expansive words reward deep reflection. Here  is a most compelling mandate for a broad BYU education and a lifetime of learning. Joseph’s  prophetic words impel, to the <i>n</i>th degree, all who are not just scholars who happen to be  Mormons, but Mormons who happen to be scholars.</p>
<p>Being a part of Mormon scholarship at BYU  has been a perpetually rewarding, mind-expanding experience for me. There is nothing closed-minded  about being a true Latter-day Saint. With the Holy Ghost, you will never get a “disk full” warning.  Every year there have been new and amazing discoveries.</p>
<p>You might wonder: So, how does  this happen? How does one’s mind expand to see or discover new things? In this acceptance speech  today, I thought it would be appropriate to try to explain how this has worked for me personally,  and, as I know, for many others as well. Actually, saying how any discovery happens is a pretty tall  order, because most discoveries are not planned or orchestrated. They often come as flashes of  inspiration or, as the Doctrine and Covenants says, “as . . . moved upon by the Holy Ghost” (D&amp;C  68:3). But whenever they happen, especially when they involve seeing some new extension or  application of gospel truth, the moment is unmistakable, bringing an abiding sense of joy and  satisfaction.</p>
<p>Consider these lines from a <i>Peanuts</i> comic strip. Charlie Brown, Lucy,  and Linus are lying on a hillside looking up at the clouds. Lucy asks, “What do you think you see,  Linus?”</p>
<p>Linus says, “Well, those clouds up there look to me like the map of the British  Honduras on the Caribbean. That cloud up there looks a little like the profile of Thomas Eakins, the  famous painter and sculptor. And that group of clouds over there gives me the impression of the  stoning of Stephen. I can see the Apostle Paul standing there to one side.”</p>
<p>Lucy says,  “That’s very good,” and asks Charlie Brown, “What do <i>you</i> see?”</p>
<p>He answers, “Well, I  was going to say I saw a ducky and a horsie, but I changed my mind!”</p>
<p>What might help us to  see like Linus? The first thing is to be looking, purposefully and constructively, for something of  value. The mind expands by recognition, or re-cognizing. Seeing in one thing something that is  faintly reminiscent of something else that is higher, deeper, or of greater substance is the  beginning of knowing and not just observing. Connecting and seeing recurring patterns, such as those  with which the gospel is replete, is the beginning of discernment and the development of potentially  meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>For example, one day as my wife and I were visiting Chartres  Cathedral, we listened to a guide explain a stained-glass window that had 12 scenes depicting the  parable of the Good Samaritan on the bottom and 12 scenes telling the story of Adam and Eve on the  top.<sup>5</sup> This pairing, which struck me at first as very odd, turned out to spawn meaningful  connections at every point, not with just a single act of kindness but with the broad pattern of the  eternal plan of salvation. In this context the man who goes down from Jerusalem, a holy place, and  falls among robbers, represents the Fall of Adam and Eve and of all mankind, as we all have come  down from our heavenly home and have fallen among the forces of evil. The Good Samaritan, who saves  the injured man, represents the Savior, who comes, has compassion, and alone is able to save all who  have been left half dead, having suffered the first but not yet the second death. He anoints with  oil, washes wounds with his wine, binds us, and promises to return a second time. But the initial  burst of connective insight is just the beginning of the discovery process. Extensive reading,  pondering, and lots of work soon yielded further insights and even found that this understanding of  the gospel of Jesus Christ was evidenced in this long-lost line of allegorical Christian  interpretation stretching back at least as far as the second century  A.D.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Indeed, most discoveries require lots of hard work. As a tax lawyer in  Los Angeles, I repeatedly saw the value of the Mormon commitment to hard work. In one case, I  represented movie star Burt Reynolds. A tax issue over whether he was a California or a Florida  resident had arisen, and his case hung in the balance. People had been over the documents many  times. A couple days before our hearing in Sacramento, I decided to double-check everything. I even  went back over Burt’s appointment books to see if any detail might have been missed. And there it  was: every year Burt was always in Florida on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Well, I walked into  the hearing humming “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.” The legal issue of residency, after all, is all  about where home is. I introduced this new fact into the record, and the state asked for a recess.  When they returned, they dropped the case. The point of this little story is simply that I was glad  to have gone the extra mile.</p>
<p>Indeed, most academic discoveries come after poring over  materials again and again. The mind expands by hard work over sustained stretches. Thus, the first  paragraph of the BYU Mission Statement emphasizes that a BYU education demands “a period of  intensive learning” with a high “commitment to excellence.” Our BYU way of doing things  enthusiastically embraces work. There are no shortcuts to good scholarship. Brilliant ideas remain  mere figments until they are verbalized, embodied in images, and brought to life. In Joseph Smith’s  words, this takes “time and experience and careful and ponderous . . . thoughts.”<sup>7</sup> We  learn best by strenuous effort. I remember vividly my student days at BYU, at Oxford, and at Duke,  because those experiences were so intense; they indelibly seared words and ideas upon my mind. Think  of how much you have learned in accelerated courses, in the compressed MTC experience, during  intense travel abroad, or by competing under pressure-packed circumstances. A Mormon motto is “We do  hard things.” Do not shy away from hard work, from long course assignments, or from demanding  challenges, for work precedes the aha moment.</p>
<p>But hard work alone is also not enough. It  is possible to exert endless energy spinning one’s wheels. To expand our understanding, we must  formulate more precise, potentially answerable questions and then keep searching, believing that an  answer is out there somewhere, giving the scriptures credence, suspending judgment, giving God the  benefit of the doubt, praying every day for His guidance, trusting that He knows the answer, that it  can somehow make sense, and not presuming that the answer must necessarily come out your way. What  we are looking for is frequently going to be found outside of the box. Sometimes the answer is “none  of the above” or “all of the above.”</p>
<p>Under its second bullet point, the BYU Mission  Statement speaks of “the pursuit” of truth. It doesn’t speak of “inventing” or “voting on” truth,  but rather of “pursuing” truth. We expand our knowledge by looking for things, pursuing things that  exist beyond our current understanding. How can one logically pursue something that one assumes does  not exist? As former BYU academic vice president Robert K. Thomas said, “Skeptics—by  definition—cannot affirm anything, even their own skepticism.”<sup>8</sup>Thus, discoveries that  have given me the greatest satisfaction have begun by assuming the correctness of a text, the  truthfulness of a proposition, or the wisdom of an instruction given by one in  authority.</p>
<p>In a recent e-mail, Terry Warner, one of my philosophy mentors and the creator  of the <i>Education in Zion</i> exhibit here on campus, spoke of what he sees as the astonishing  momentum that has been developed in Mormon studies by many first-rate scholars here at BYU. He  said:</p>
<p><i>I have wondered whether the first dislodged stone, in what is becoming  almost an avalanche of scholarship, was not Nibley’s gutsy determination to see what could be made  of the available historical evidence by assuming (at least the possibility of) the truth of LDS  claims, rather than by assuming their falsehood. . . . It was Leibniz who insisted that one cannot  adequately understand the meaning of a proposition without assuming its  truth.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Of course, the scientific method rightly propounds a  hypothesis and then tries to invalidate it; but still the hypothesis is not considered false  <i>before</i> it has been found to have failed. There is something wrong—as much in academic halls  as in courtrooms—about assuming something or someone to be guilty until proven  innocent.</p>
<p>As an example, when I began teaching a course on ancient laws in the Book of  Mormon, I ran across the case of Seantum, the man who secretly stabbed his brother seated on the  judgment seat and was detected by Nephi’s prophecy in Helaman 8–9. Since there were no witnesses,  how could Seantum be executed under the law of Moses, which required two or three witnesses in order  to convict? Rather than sadly conceding that there must be an embarrassing blunder here, I continued  studying more about ancient Hebrew law, only to learn quite unexpectedly at a Jewish law conference  that an ancient exception to the two-witness rule, which was traced in rabbinic law as far back as  Joshua 7, allowed that the two-witness rule could be satisfied if the culprit confessed voluntarily  outside of court or if God’s hand was involved in the detection of the offender and if corroborating  physical evidence (such as blood on the skirts of his cloak) was found. As it turns out, the Book of  Mormon goes out of its way to report these very points. The case against Seantum is not an  embarrassment but remarkably sound.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>When we come up against things that seem  out of sorts or nonsensical, our critical instincts lure us into thinking that there must be  something wrong. But a special joy attaches to the discovery of a new insight that began with the  thought that something was wrong but turned out to be right. It’s the joy of finally seeing an odd  little puzzle piece snap into place in the bigger picture. It’s the joy that comes from the great  gospel principle of reversal: that by small things come great purposes; that the Lord’s ways are not  always the world’s ways (see Isaiah 55:8); that the poor are rich; and that those who lose their  lives for Christ’s sake will be the ones who will ultimately find eternal joy (see Matthew  10:39).</p>
<p>So, I go on high alert when I notice interesting anomalies, which are often clues  of something going on below the surface. Truth will be found in odd places, as high and low and  broad as the eternal expanse, as Joseph said. Moses’ mind was certainly stretched by the amazing  things he saw in unexpected places, which things he had never supposed (see Moses 1:10). No one was  more surprised by what Joseph Smith was told in his First Vision than was he himself. It was not at  all what he was expecting.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Recently, reading on a plane to Portland, Oregon,  I noticed something unexpected in the hardly ever mentioned parable of the two sons in Matthew 21.  After Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the chief priests approached Him in the temple and  demanded: “By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?” (Matthew  21:23). Jesus answered by telling a story about a certain man who had two sons. When asked to go  down and work in the vineyard, the first son initially refused, but then he went, while the other  initially said yes but then does not go, or so it seems (see Matthew 21:28–30). This parable may be  useful in parenting, and it can be read at that level; but remember, that’s not what Jesus was asked  about. With the question of authority in mind, as I read this parable in the Greek, something jumped  off the page at me. Think about it: When did a certain father have two sons, One who went and the  other who did not? When did the First (the Firstborn) say, “<i>Ou thelo</i>,” which in Greek means  “I will it not,” or “I’d rather not,” or “it is not my <i>will</i>.” As the Greek continues, that  Son reconciled Himself (not repented Himself) and went. In contrast, the “other” (the  <i>heteros</i>) son simply said, “<i>Ego</i>,” meaning “I.” But I <i>what</i>? Readers must fill in  this blank. In this verse, the word <i>go</i> in the King James Version is italicized, because it  has only been implied there. One might as well supply other words: “I . . . will have it my way,” or  “I . . . will get the glory.” In any event, this egotistic son did not go. As Latter-day Saints, we  can easily but unexpectedly see at this deeper level how this unassuming little parable answers the  all-important questions about Jesus’ authority. He received it from the Father in the Council in  Heaven when He was commissioned to go down and do, not His will, but the will of the  Father.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Believing that God has revealed and yet will reveal many great and  important things commits us to approach some things differently from the rest of the world, and for  me that’s okay. There will always be worldly things that will make it difficult to be a Latter-day  Saint by making some Mormon beliefs objectionable, frustrating, or awkward. And we won’t always have  all the answers to these difficulties, certainly not the moment they first arise. But this too  invites further stretching and expansion. Our ongoing task as Latter-day Saints is to locate  defensible answers that are also consistent with our scriptures, doctrines, and assumptions and to  understand how opposing views often depend principally upon other fundamentally different  assumptions.</p>
<p>For example, the Mormon point of view sees work differently from the world,  because we know that God Himself has a work, and it is His glory; and we affirm, by our actions,  that faith without works is dead (see Moses 1:39; James 2:26).</p>
<p>We also see ethics quite  differently because, for us, humans are not disconnected creatures with whom we selectively enter  into social contracts, but all are related to us, as members of our premortal family.<a href="http://lds.org/family/proclamation?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>13</sup></a>  That expansive factor transforms the foundations of ethics and the meaning of  ethnicity.</p>
<p>We see moral agency differently. As President Hinckley taught, false freedom is  freedom to do what one likes; true freedom is freedom to do what one  ought.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>We see history differently. The reality of the Apostasy shows that the  fittest don’t always survive.</p>
<p>We see power differently, because we take seriously the  scriptural curse placed on anyone who misuses power for glory or gain, and we know that the greatest  must be the servants of all (D&amp;C 121:36–39; Matt. 23:11). Because of this, we do not share the  common animus against hierarchy and authority.</p>
<p>We see issues of gender equality  differently. The secular world would collapse equality into sameness. But equality does not mean  identity.<sup>15</sup> Four plus four and two plus six are different, but both are equal to  eight.</p>
<p>At BYU we have the constant opportunity to bring many Mormon insights to bear on  scholarly topics and just as much to bring scholarly perspectives to bear on topics of importance to  Latter-day Saints. If we think there isn’t a Mormon point of view on any subject, it may well be  that we haven’t yet looked high or deep or wide enough.</p>
<p>With stretching the mind comes an  openness to embrace more. The BYU Mission Statement speaks of the pursuit of <i>all</i> truth. Our  desire is for further light and understanding, to circumscribe all truth. To me, Mormonism thrives  because it welcomes the idea that the world is fundamentally pluralistic by nature. Over and over,  the Mormon worldview relishes multiplicity. Words found traditionally only in the singular are  boldly spoken of as plurals in Mormon doctrine: we speak of priesthoods, intelligences, noble and  great ones, two creations, worlds without number, continuing revelations, scriptures, covenants,  degrees of glory, eternal lives, saviors on Mt. Zion, and even gods. Joseph Smith spoke of there  being many kingdoms and that “unto every kingdom is given [its own] law,” and “all truth is  independent in that sphere in which God has placed it” (D&amp;C 88:38, 93:30). To me, such  statements of cosmological relativities unleash and transfigure the concepts of natural law and  eternal truths.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>It took a century for the world to even begin to catch up  with this expansive notion revealed by Joseph Smith. For example, I am fascinated by the  implications of Gödel’s 1931 incompleteness theorem, which demonstrates that a system can be either  complete or consistent, but not both.<sup>17</sup> Thus, systematic theologies or rational  philosophies may well be internally consistent, but they do so at the expense of completeness. Sets  and abstractions may be helpful, but they are simply extractions of selected elements of otherwise  messy realities. Mormon thought, in contrast, privileges fullness, abundance, completeness, and all  that the Father has, even if that means that Mormon life becomes joyously overloaded or torn by  competing pressures that pull, stretch, and expand us in many ways. This may produce episodes of  cognitive dissonance, social quandaries, mystery, and uncertainty, but if forced to choose, Mormon  thought will always prefer openness over closedness, boldly inviting further growth, progression,  and—fortunately for us in academia—further questions.</p>
<p>This dynamic view has certainly  influenced my legal thinking. Over the years I have taught classes about corporations, partnerships,  and other organizations that are all managed by various kinds of officers, trustees, and  administrators. The law holds these people to standards called fiduciary duties. Despite thousands  of cases, the law hasn’t addressed the question of what makes one fiduciary duty high and another  low. But in our complex world, one size does not fit all. Thinking more expansively, Professor Brett  Scharffs and I have identified a set of factors that reveal whether a fiduciary duty is high,  medium, or low and what degree of duty is required of fiduciaries in all kinds of  settings.<sup>18</sup> Thinking this way may seem obvious enough to you as a Latter-day Saint, since  you already believe that there will be varying degrees of treatment and glory for every person  according to their individual deeds and circumstances. But recent events in the corporate world show  how much in need we are of a more robust legal approach to the duties owed by people in positions of  greatest trust.</p>
<p>Concerning duties, let me mention one other part of this subject that has  occupied much of my thought in the last decade.<sup>19</sup> Because we know that there must be an  opposition in all things, LDS thought often harmonizes traditional paradoxes. The world has fought  wars over whether we are saved by faith or by works. We peacefully say, “Both.” People argue over  whether we come to know by study or by faith. We confidently say, “Both.” “Each of us must  accommodate the mixture of reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but  <i>requires</i> it,” President Boyd K. Packer has said.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_say-unto-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>20</sup></a> In the same way, Mormon thought  brings together both rights and duties. Rights and duties go hand in glove with each other, for with  all rights come duties. I think this is because with all rights come powers and privileges, and with  powers and privileges come duties. As Latter-day Saints, again, we intuitively sense this, for we  know that all who have been warned have the duty to warn their neighbors (D&amp;C 88:81), that with  greater knowledge comes greater stewardship and accountability, and that “Because I have been given  much, I too must give.”<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>But this is decidedly not the way people usually  think about rights. The world usually thinks that, because I have a right, someone else has a duty,  namely to protect or fulfill my right. While that is true enough, at the same time, if I claim a  right, power, or privilege, I also acquire a duty as its necessary flip  side.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>I have no doubt that the 20th century will go down in history as the  century of rights: voting rights, workers’ rights, civil rights, human rights, privacy rights,  disability rights, and many more. With these rights in place, I can only hope that the 21st century  will someday go down in history as the century of duties: civic duties, human duties, fiduciary  duties, religious duties, environmental duties, and duties to future generations. I yearn for the  day when we will have a Bill of Duties to go with our Bill of Rights. As world resources become  scarcer, and as all nations, tongues, and peoples become more vulnerably interdependent, the idea of  individual rights will necessarily change. How many rights can the world support without all people  assuming commensurate duties? The point is not to take rights away but to recognize the duties that  are inherent in those very privileges.</p>
<p>Speaking of privileges, we in the academic world  are certainly among the most privileged. We enjoy the extraordinary blessings of time to read,  think, write, listen, and talk about things we love. With those blessings, one would have thought,  would also come a great awareness of our responsibilities. As Joseph said, “None but fools will  trifle with the souls of [others].”<sup>23</sup> Yet, as Stanford President Donald Kennedy wrote in  1997, “The responsibility of the professoriate is a difficult subject about which surprisingly  little has been said,”<sup>24</sup> and that serious defect still remains inexcusably  unaddressed.</p>
<p>I am pleased that we at BYU Studies have adopted a code of academic  duties.<sup>25</sup> This multidisciplinary LDS quarterly journal is open to all authors and  readers. Its code draws on scriptural mandates, hoping to encourage among LDS scholars such things  as unity (“if ye are not one ye are not mine” [D&amp;C 38:27]); charity (for if we have not charity,  we are nothing [see 1 Corinthians 13:2]); edification (the goal is to be spiritually and  intellectually upbuilding); and honesty and integrity (for accuracy and reliability are the essence  of scholarship). And, by the way, it’s all right, like Charlie Brown, to see a ducky and a horsie,  if that’s what you honestly see.</p>
<p>As President Monson has often said, duty basically means  charitably putting other people ahead of one’s own self-interests.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/do-your-duty-that-is-best?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>26</sup></a>Our minds stretch  the farthest when they are pure and actively concerned about the welfare of others. Unselfishness is  what allows the mind to stretch without snapping. Thus, for good reason, the BYU Mission Statement  again stretches us to know as much as possible, not only about our own culture but also about the  cultures of others. It is rightly said that he who knows only one culture knows no  culture.</p>
<p>I like the way George Handley, an associate editor of BYU Studies, sees this. He  writes, “My discovery [has been] that listening carefully to other voices and other cultures doesn’t  have to involve sacrificing our values,” but rather helps me to understand better my own  “Mormonness.”<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>As Brigham Young charged the elders going out into the world,  he said: “Whether a truth be found with professed infidels, . . . or the Church of Rome, . . . it is  the [duty] of the Elders of this Church . . . to gather up all the truths in the world pertaining to  life and salvation, to the Gospel we preach, to mechanism of every kind, to the sciences, and to  philosophy, wherever it may be found . . . and bring it to Zion.”<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>Indeed, it  was from a Catholic Jesuit that I first learned about chiasmus<sup>29</sup> and from a Jewish  barrister that I learned about the ancient legal difference between thieves and  robbers.<sup>30</sup> And, by the way, both of those scholars were genuinely glad to see in the Book  of Mormon these things that they had found in Hebraic settings.</p>
<p>As Latter-day Saints we  certainly understand the benefits of learning from others and reaching out to collaborate with  others. Our experiences in councils and presidencies instill in us a sociality that easily carries  over into our way of doing scholarship. Identify a project, assemble the right team, and see what  you can accomplish. Team victories magnify the thrill. Among the best memories of my academic life  are many team efforts, such as Macmillan’s<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i> with Dan Ludlow’s team  of eight hundred contributors.<sup>31</sup> I am now thrilled to be working on the legal team of the  vital Joseph Smith Papers Project.<sup>32</sup> We now know that Joseph was distracted by over 200  lawsuits in his lifetime, and their documentary records are astonishingly more complex than any one  person can sort out. Two or three lawsuits are usually enough to overwhelm most men, but Joseph  succeeded by working collaboratively and expansively with numerous associates, including the Holy  Ghost as his regular companion.</p>
<p>Well, our time is nearly gone, and we’ve only scratched  the surface of the BYU Mission Statement. I intend no disregard of any word in it. Equally important  to me are its dozens of other vital elements, upon which we could equally expand: assisting  individuals in realizing their full human potential; staging a variety of extracurricular  experiences; preparing people to meet personal and family challenges; competing with the best in  each field; making scholarly resources available to the Church when asked; loving God  devoutly;<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/posts/never-good-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>33</sup></a> following the living prophets, and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to  all—in other words, no child of God left behind. If nothing else, I hope my comments today have  opened up some intriguing possibilities for you to think about.</p>
<p>In the end the BYU Mission  Statement calls on us to “have a strong effect on the course of higher education” and to “be an  influence in a world we wish to improve.” In this, our uniqueness can be an asset. As mediators  between competing views, we can offer alternative solutions. And we need not be reluctant. We have  all been electrified this season by Jimmer Fredette’s incredible, dramatic long shots. The sign I  liked the best was “Jimmer’s in range when he steps off the bus.” Mormon thought is also capable of  hitting a stunning array of intellectual long shots, doing things that traditional Western thinkers  have said cannot be done. Everywhere you turn, Joseph’s words hit the mark. He was in range every  time he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>In a book now at press with Oxford, Stephen Webb, a non-LDS  professor of religion, writes of Mormonism: “No other religious movement lies so close to  traditional Christianity. . . . Mormon theology is Christology unbound. . . . Of all the branches of  Christianity, Mormonism is the most imaginative, and if nothing else, its intellectual audacity  should make it the most exciting conversational partner for traditional Christians for the  twenty-first century.”<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>I know that we can accomplish the goals of the BYU  Mission Statement. Like many other Latter-day Saints, I have spoken to various academic groups, with  their respect and genuine interest. After one paper I gave to a meeting of the Jewish Law  Association in Boston,<sup>35</sup> an older rabbi congratulated me and said, “Very, very good, but  why does a <i>goyyim</i> [a Gentile] have to show us these things in our own Torah!” After a paper I  presented on ritual theory and temple themes in the Sermon on the Mount,<sup>36</sup> of all the  comments I received, I was most gratified by this one: “I have been attending these conferences for  30 years. You, for the first time, brought the Spirit into the room.” Latter-day Saints can indeed  be an influence in a world we wish to improve.</p>
<p>So, let us rejoice! Shall we not, each in  our own way, go on in so great a cause? The point is to come to think more as God thinks and to see  His children and this creation more as He does. The more we become like that, the more the stone  face on the mountain of the Lord, that stone that some builders have refused, can become the head of  the corner and that image can be received in our countenances.</p>
<p>We need not be ashamed of  the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was truly a prophet. The scriptures are true and  in them we find our way. The expansiveness of the truth invites us to venture forward, as high and  as deep and as broad as our minds may go. Thy mind, O man, must stretch. Indeed, it can and will  stretch, if you will lead a soul (including your own) unto salvation and will commune with God, that  our joy may be full and abundant, in time and all eternity. For your thoughtful attention and  goodness, I thank you very, very much.</p>

<p>Brigham  Young University Mission Statement</p>
<p>The mission of Brigham Young University—founded, supported,  and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—is to assist individuals in their  quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning  in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of  human potential is pursued.</p>
<p>All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide  variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced  development of the total person. Such a broadly prepared individual will not only be capable of  meeting personal challenge and change but will also bring strength to others in the tasks of home  and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.</p>
<p>To succeed in  this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets and sustained  by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God. In that  environment these four major educational goals should prevail:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>All  students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is  inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can  be saved. Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and  a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because the  gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth, students at BYU should receive a broad university  education. The arts, letters, and sciences provide the core of such an education, which will help  students think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural  tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual  integrity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition to a strong general education, students should also  receive instruction in the special fields of their choice. The university cannot provide programs in  all possible areas of professional or vocational work, but in those it does provide the preparation  must be excellent. Students who graduate from BYU should be capable of competing with the best in  their fields.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty  and students, including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence, are essential and  will be encouraged.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In meeting these objectives BYU’s faculty, staff,  students, and administrators should be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide. In an era of  limited enrollments, BYU can continue to expand its influence both by encouraging programs that are  central to the Church’s purposes and by making its resources available to the Church when called  upon to do so.</p>
<p>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a  strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University’s  influence in a world we wish to improve.</p>
<p><i>—Approved by the BYU Board of  TrusteesNovember 4, 1981</i></p>
<h2><b>Appendix B</b></h2>
<p>BYU Studies Author Guidelines: Article  Submissions</p>
<p><i>BYU Studies</i> strives to explore scholarly perspectives on LDS topics.  Contributions from all fields of learning are invited. <i>BYU Studies</i> strives to publish  articles that openly reflect a Latter-day Saint point of view and are obviously relevant to subjects  of general interest to Latter-day Saints, while conforming to high scholarly standards. <i>BYU  Studies</i> seeks articles that document or analyze, in a scholarly manner, topics related to LDS  history, culture, society, art, language, literature, science, thought, or experience. Short studies  and research involving significant historical documents are also welcomed.</p>
<p><i>BYU  Studies</i> is dedicated to the correlation of revealed and discovered truth and to the conviction  that the spiritual and the intellectual can be complementary and fundamentally harmonious avenues of  knowledge. All who venture to write for <i>BYU Studies</i>should morally confront certain  responsibilities that may be said to comprise a sort of academic code of professional conduct. Some  important components of such a code would embrace at least the following  precepts.</p>
<p><b>Unity. </b>The Lord has clearly stated: “If ye are not one ye are not mine”  (D&amp;C 38:27). In a shifting world that necessarily and fortunately features diversity,  individuality, heterodoxy, and change, the goal of unity with God and our fellow beings must be  continually cultivated and nourished. The goal of unity does not imply that all scholarly methods or  personal views must be the same.</p>
<p><b>Harmony.</b> <i>BYU Studies</i> is committed to  seeking truth “by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 88:118). It proceeds on the premise that faith  and reason, revelation and scholarly learning, obedience and creativity are compatible. Traditional  dichotomies such as mind and body, God and man, spirit and matter, time and eternity, are not viewed  in the gospel of Jesus Christ as competing opposites. The objective is to embrace both: ancient and  modern, word and deed, intellectual and spiritual, research and teaching, reason and revelation, the  “ought” and the “is,” community and individuality, male and female, nature and custom, induction and  deduction, analysis and synthesis, rights and duties, subjectivity and objectivity, theory and  practice, even mortality and godhood. We can grow beyond issues over which is greater, the spirit or  the intellect. As Elder Boyd K. Packer has stated, “Each of us must accommodate the mixture of  reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but <i>requires</i>  it.”</p>
<p><b>Honesty.</b> As a primary trait of character, “we believe in being honest”  (Articles of Faith 1:13). Accuracy and reliability are of the essence of scholarship. All scholars  worth their salt have wrestled long with the questions of what can and cannot, what should and  should not, what must or must not be said. They acknowledge and evaluate data both for and against  their ideas and theories. They eschew all forms of plagiarism and generously recognize their  indebtedness to other scholars. They guard on all sides against the covert influences of unstated  assumptions, bias, and esoteric terminology. They avoid material omissions, for often what is not  said can be as misleading as what is said.</p>
<p><b>Thoroughness.</b> “If there is anything  virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things” (Articles of Faith  1:13). <i>BYU Studies</i> welcomes contributions from all disciplines,  addressing</p>
<p><i>all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for  you to understand;</i></p>
<p><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth;  things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are  at home, things which are abroad, . . .</i></p>
<p><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when  I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you.</i> [D&amp;C  88:78–80]</p>
<p><b>Humility.</b> Pride has been identified as the pervading sin of our  day. As scholars we have more than our share of exposure to this problem. Arrogance, disdain,  overconfidence, dogmatism, and many other manifestations of intellectual and spiritual pride may  well be the main occupational hazards of academia. But the perspectives of scholarship and the  gospel can also provide the antidote. First is the acknowledgement that all people are at different  stages in the eternal journey toward the glory of God, which is intelligence. Second is the humble  awareness that scholarship is not an end in itself. Research cannot create faith; it can only set  the stage for greater light and knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Charity.</b> In order for communication to  occur, there must be charity, for no statement exists (including this one) that cannot be  misconstrued. If fellowship and goodwill do not exist, especially in an academic setting, we will  not communicate with one another. Paul’s confession comes to mind: “Though I have the gift of  prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge . . . and have not charity, I am nothing”  (1 Corinthians 13:2). Charity is also necessary to avoid offending even the weakest of the Saints.  Jesus said:</p>
<p><i>It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through  whom they come!</i></p>
<p><i>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his  neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</i> [Luke  17:1–2]</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:
I want you to remember that you ought not to tea</span>

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
