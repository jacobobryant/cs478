  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is indeed my pleasure to welcome you, my dear friends, back to a new semester at Brigham Young University in a new year - 2009. I tend to view a new year as somewhat of a fresh start in my life. It offers me the opportunity to reflect on the previous year and to evaluate my life and the growth I hopefully have made as I strive to become the person I want to be in relation to the teachings of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I would surmise that most of you have done the same as you attempt to set New Years goals.

As I went through this process and reflected upon the birth of Christ this past Christmas season, I felt deeply that the world today has an even greater need to make room in our hearts for Him. This past year we have seen that conditions of the world economically, politically, and socially can be extremely dark and depressing without the hope and knowledge of the Saviors mission and message.

A short time ago a friend related to a group of women an experience she had in 1980. While she was attending Sunday School at a church meeting in eastern Washington, the class was informed that there were unusual cloud formations in the sky. The class went outside to view them and saw that the formations were indeed very strange and unique. The entire sky consisted of huge, puffy gray clouds for as far as they could see. They were told it was possible that a volcano had erupted on the coast. Then they heard over a car radio that Mount Saint Helens had erupted and that, even though the volcano was hundreds of miles away from them, the wind was blowing the clouds of ash toward the east. At that point no one was too concerned.

However, later in the afternoon the sky began to get darker and darker. Before long it was completely black with an eerie darkness that she had never seen before or since. The members were counseled to be careful as they drove home.

As my friend continued telling her experience to our group, she said:

There was a sense of concern and fear of the unknown. When we went to the cars, there was powdery stuff everywhere. It was falling all around us. It was coming down like a dry rain and contributed to the darkness. There were now clouds of ash surrounding us. It was so dark that we could barely see a person standing three feet away. We held hands and ran to our cars.

As we drove, we could barely see what was in front of us. Even with the headlights on, our visibility was minimal. The windshield wipers were working hard to push away the constantly falling ash. As we slowly drove into the blackness, one thing stood out to me. Birds were flying directly into the beams of the headlights. It was obvious that they were seeking light in this time of turmoil and confusion.

After we got to our grandmothers house, the same thing happened. This time the birds were flying toward the windows of the home, often hitting the glass. It was apparent that they were disoriented and fearful. The only thing they wanted was light. They were searching for some kind of hope in the distant lights ahead.

It was obvious to my friend, as she related this experience, that when surrounded by darkness, confusion, fear, and panic, the birds sought the only hope of safety they had at that time - and to them their only hope was the light.

You young men and women are on a wonderful journey during this stage of your lives as you move ahead in gaining an education. There will be pathways to follow that you cannot yet imagine and experiences that will teach you many lessons of life. Just as the birds experienced darkness, confusion, and fear at one point in their lives, so will you. There are wonderful joys and blessings in your futures but challenges, fears, sorrows, and disappointments as well.

I am certain that even now you could relate numerous examples in your lives that illustrate all of these different circumstances. You have faced challenges and had disappointments as well as successes and wonderful achievements. You have been excited and joyful, and you have felt inadequate and fearful. However, you are so blessed that whenever you find yourselves amidst difficult and dark times in this troubled world, you have a safe and sure guiding light to bring you peace, joy, and happiness. It is available to anyone who would seek it in every nation, kindred, and tongue.

The scriptures teach us that "when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of [the] gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 45:28). The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the sure light that shines for those who seek Him - even when we see the workings and mighty influence of the adversary in todays world. Satan seeks to bring darkness into the lives of the children of our Father in Heaven - and thus into yours.

The previous scripture continues and states, "But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men" (D&amp;amp;C 45:29). Many are like those in Lehis dream, described in the Book of Mormon, who could not hold fast to the iron rod - or the word of God - and go toward the tree of life. They succumbed to the temptations of Satan and to the pride, wisdom, and vanity of the world. This is much too common in the world in which you live today.

In Mosiah 16:9 we are taught that our Savior, Jesus Christ, "is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened." Jesus and His gospel are the lights that can guide you throughout your journey here on earth. These lights are brighter and stronger than any darkness you will encounter in this life.

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught this wonderful principle as he related Christs message to us in the Doctrine and Covenants: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). However, Christs light and the gospel message of light can be darkened in your own lives when you choose to disobey the commandments or when your faith grows dim.

Each of you makes choices every day. Some choices can keep you walking in the light; others can cause you to begin walking toward darkness. You make choices about those with whom you associate. Do they help instill the light of the gospel in your life? Do they walk the path toward the light with you, or do they tend to nudge you in another direction?

The gospel teaches: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). Conversely, we are warned, "And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness" (D&amp;amp;C 50:23).

In September 1989, Joshua Dennis was a 10-year-old Scout who found himself alone, trapped, and lost on a ledge in an abandoned mine in Tooele County, Utah. He spent five days in pitch-black darkness as searchers frantically tried to find him. To this day, I can recall reading the accounts of this story and following the reports on television. I remember thinking how frightened I would be if I were the one lost or if it were one of my loved ones in such a circumstance. I could not imagine being alone in total darkness, not daring to move in any direction. I couldnt see myself in that situation at any age - and for five days! Imagine what Joshua must have felt when he first heard the searchers and saw the light from a flashlight - a light that let him know he had been found and would soon be with his family.

When young Josh spoke at a fireside sometime after his recovery, he said, "I wasnt alone in the mine. Heavenly Father sent angels to be with me. I didnt see them, but I knew they were there because I was comforted" (in Carolyn Goates Campbell, "Hidden Treasure: Ten-Year-Old Josh Dennis Lost in Mine," Ensign, August 1991, 35).

I am sure Josh had been taught that Jesus Christ is a light in our lives and that His light can be with us whatever darkness surrounds us. Josh surely knew that he had the Light of Christ with him. This light sustained him and thus helped him find the courage to be brave during his ordeal. It gave him the hope that he would be found.

Each one of you has the light of Jesus Christ within you. How wonderful that is for you as you strive to discern what is truly of great worth in your life. The world of today will offer you many counterfeits to tempt you to turn away from the light of the gospel. Riches, power, and status are all worldly aspirations that have been built up to great importance in the eyes of men, but these can take you down the path toward darkness if you let them. Live so that you are worthy to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to help guide you in your choices and in the paths you take that will lead you in righteousness and eternal joy.

During President Gordon B. Hinckleys service as our prophet, we heard often that the Church had come out of obscurity. We have become very visible, and our work, which is the work of our Savior, is being viewed by the world. It cannot and will not be hidden. This brings many challenges as well as opportunities for all of us. The adversary knows this and will attempt to dim the light of the gospel so that it cannot shine brightly in the world or in our lives. We must be a light of the gospel of Jesus Christ to others. Christ Himself commanded, "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).

You wonderful young men and women are the leaders of the future. You will be leaders in your communities, in the Church, and, most important, in your families. You will not and cannot be hidden from the world. Others will view you not only as representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but also as representatives of the Savior and the message He taught. The Lord loves you and will bless you each day. He has given you the light of the gospel and has asked that you "let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).

That each one of you here will continually let the light of the gospel shine in your faces wherever you go and in whatever you do is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>It is indeed my pleasure to welcome you, my dear friends, back to a new semester at Brigham Young University in a new year - 2009. I tend to view a new year as somewhat of a fresh start in my life. It offers me the opportunity to reflect on the previous year and to evaluate my life and the growth I hopefully have made as I strive to become the person I want to be in relation to the teachings of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I would surmise that most of you have done the same as you attempt to set New Years goals.</p>
<p>As I went through this process and reflected upon the birth of Christ this past Christmas season, I felt deeply that the world today has an even greater need to make room in our hearts for Him. This past year we have seen that conditions of the world economically, politically, and socially can be extremely dark and depressing without the hope and knowledge of the Saviors mission and message.</p>
<p>A short time ago a friend related to a group of women an experience she had in 1980. While she was attending Sunday School at a church meeting in eastern Washington, the class was informed that there were unusual cloud formations in the sky. The class went outside to view them and saw that the formations were indeed very strange and unique. The entire sky consisted of huge, puffy gray clouds for as far as they could see. They were told it was possible that a volcano had erupted on the coast. Then they heard over a car radio that Mount Saint Helens had erupted and that, even though the volcano was hundreds of miles away from them, the wind was blowing the clouds of ash toward the east. At that point no one was too concerned.</p>
<p>However, later in the afternoon the sky began to get darker and darker. Before long it was completely black with an eerie darkness that she had never seen before or since. The members were counseled to be careful as they drove home.</p>
<p>As my friend continued telling her experience to our group, she said:</p>
<p>There was a sense of concern and fear of the unknown. When we went to the cars, there was powdery stuff everywhere. It was falling all around us. It was coming down like a dry rain and contributed to the darkness. There were now clouds of ash surrounding us. It was so dark that we could barely see a person standing three feet away. We held hands and ran to our cars.</p>
<p>As we drove, we could barely see what was in front of us. Even with the headlights on, our visibility was minimal. The windshield wipers were working hard to push away the constantly falling ash. As we slowly drove into the blackness, one thing stood out to me. Birds were flying directly into the beams of the headlights. It was obvious that they were seeking light in this time of turmoil and confusion.</p>
<p>After we got to our grandmothers house, the same thing happened. This time the birds were flying toward the windows of the home, often hitting the glass. It was apparent that they were disoriented and fearful. The only thing they wanted was light. They were searching for some kind of hope in the distant lights ahead.</p>
<p>It was obvious to my friend, as she related this experience, that when surrounded by darkness, confusion, fear, and panic, the birds sought the only hope of safety they had at that time - and to them their only hope was the light.</p>
<p>You young men and women are on a wonderful journey during this stage of your lives as you move ahead in gaining an education. There will be pathways to follow that you cannot yet imagine and experiences that will teach you many lessons of life. Just as the birds experienced darkness, confusion, and fear at one point in their lives, so will you. There are wonderful joys and blessings in your futures but challenges, fears, sorrows, and disappointments as well.</p>
<p>I am certain that even now you could relate numerous examples in your lives that illustrate all of these different circumstances. You have faced challenges and had disappointments as well as successes and wonderful achievements. You have been excited and joyful, and you have felt inadequate and fearful. However, you are so blessed that whenever you find yourselves amidst difficult and dark times in this troubled world, you have a safe and sure guiding light to bring you peace, joy, and happiness. It is available to anyone who would seek it in every nation, kindred, and tongue.</p>
<p>The scriptures teach us that "when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of [the] gospel" (D&amp;C 45:28). The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the sure light that shines for those who seek Him - even when we see the workings and mighty influence of the adversary in todays world. Satan seeks to bring darkness into the lives of the children of our Father in Heaven - and thus into yours.</p>
<p>The previous scripture continues and states, "But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men" (D&amp;C 45:29). Many are like those in Lehis dream, described in the Book of Mormon, who could not hold fast to the iron rod - or the word of God - and go toward the tree of life. They succumbed to the temptations of Satan and to the pride, wisdom, and vanity of the world. This is much too common in the world in which you live today.</p>
<p>In Mosiah 16:9 we are taught that our Savior, Jesus Christ, "is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened." Jesus and His gospel are the lights that can guide you throughout your journey here on earth. These lights are brighter and stronger than any darkness you will encounter in this life.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught this wonderful principle as he related Christs message to us in the Doctrine and Covenants: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you" (D&amp;C 88:67). However, Christs light and the gospel message of light can be darkened in your own lives when you choose to disobey the commandments or when your faith grows dim.</p>
<p>Each of you makes choices every day. Some choices can keep you walking in the light; others can cause you to begin walking toward darkness. You make choices about those with whom you associate. Do they help instill the light of the gospel in your life? Do they walk the path toward the light with you, or do they tend to nudge you in another direction?</p>
<p>The gospel teaches: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter" (D&amp;C 50:24). Conversely, we are warned, "And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness" (D&amp;C 50:23).</p>
<p>In September 1989, Joshua Dennis was a 10-year-old Scout who found himself alone, trapped, and lost on a ledge in an abandoned mine in Tooele County, Utah. He spent five days in pitch-black darkness as searchers frantically tried to find him. To this day, I can recall reading the accounts of this story and following the reports on television. I remember thinking how frightened I would be if I were the one lost or if it were one of my loved ones in such a circumstance. I could not imagine being alone in total darkness, not daring to move in any direction. I couldnt see myself in that situation at any age - and for five days! Imagine what Joshua must have felt when he first heard the searchers and saw the light from a flashlight - a light that let him know he had been found and would soon be with his family.</p>
<p>When young Josh spoke at a fireside sometime after his recovery, he said, "I wasnt alone in the mine. Heavenly Father sent angels to be with me. I didnt see them, but I knew they were there because I was comforted" (in Carolyn Goates Campbell, "Hidden Treasure: Ten-Year-Old Josh Dennis Lost in Mine," Ensign, August 1991, 35).</p>
<p>I am sure Josh had been taught that Jesus Christ is a light in our lives and that His light can be with us whatever darkness surrounds us. Josh surely knew that he had the Light of Christ with him. This light sustained him and thus helped him find the courage to be brave during his ordeal. It gave him the hope that he would be found.</p>
<p>Each one of you has the light of Jesus Christ within you. How wonderful that is for you as you strive to discern what is truly of great worth in your life. The world of today will offer you many counterfeits to tempt you to turn away from the light of the gospel. Riches, power, and status are all worldly aspirations that have been built up to great importance in the eyes of men, but these can take you down the path toward darkness if you let them. Live so that you are worthy to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to help guide you in your choices and in the paths you take that will lead you in righteousness and eternal joy.</p>
<p>During President Gordon B. Hinckleys service as our prophet, we heard often that the Church had come out of obscurity. We have become very visible, and our work, which is the work of our Savior, is being viewed by the world. It cannot and will not be hidden. This brings many challenges as well as opportunities for all of us. The adversary knows this and will attempt to dim the light of the gospel so that it cannot shine brightly in the world or in our lives. We must be a light of the gospel of Jesus Christ to others. Christ Himself commanded, "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).</p>
<p>You wonderful young men and women are the leaders of the future. You will be leaders in your communities, in the Church, and, most important, in your families. You will not and cannot be hidden from the world. Others will view you not only as representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but also as representatives of the Savior and the message He taught. The Lord loves you and will bless you each day. He has given you the light of the gospel and has asked that you "let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).</p>
<p>That each one of you here will continually let the light of the gospel shine in your faces wherever you go and in whatever you do is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Shortly after accepting my job at BYU, I called Elder Jeffrey R. Hollands office to ask if he would do the voice-over for an athletics commercial during the height of Jimmermania. Because of my football career I had gotten to know Elder Holland, and I thought he would be the perfect person, with his distinctive voice, for the job.
Then I had a meeting with Tom Holmoe, BYUs athletic director, and I let him know how excited I was about the possibility of including Elder Holland in our project. I naively assumed that Tom would be thrilled about my phone call and invitation.
I was wrong. It was a major faux pas. He let me know that any invitation to one of the leaders of the Church needed to go through the president of the school. I quickly wrote an apology to President Samuelson, and this was his inspiring reply:
Chad,
No need to worry. We sometimes forget to inform those coming into BYU employment of the unique way things are done at BYU, particularly when it relates to contacts and requests of the senior Brethren. You are like those guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom because no one ever taught them the gospel. We probably should not take this one up the line, but feel free to raise any good ideas you have. Sorry we didnt loop you in earlier. I know Elder Hollands only concern would be disappointing you. Know that you are loved and appreciated. All the best.
Cec
I love that letter. It is a shining example of my topic today: "The World Needs to See and Feel Your Light." What does President Samuelsons letter, with his good-natured correction for me, have to do with this theme? Everything! How do you think it made me feel as a new BYU employee to receive that letter? It inspired me. He didnt crush me with his authority; it was just the opposite. I could feel his light and the love he had for me.
As I share my thoughts with you today, I hope to better prepare you for tomorrow. Many of you will run your own companies. You may hold positions of leadership. You would be wise to follow President Samuelsons great example of how to correct and inspire others.
President Samuelson has tried to respond to every email from every student. Think of the encouragement and faith that he has shared with you and other students over the last eleven years. He has certainly followed the counsel of the Savior to let his light shine. He and Sister Samuelson are awesome, and I will miss my association with them. President Kevin Worthen and his wife, Peggy, will likewise win your hearts and earn your respect as they serve you. I know President Worthen and have complete confidence in him.
Our Savior Jesus Christ said, "Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 12:16). That is my favorite scripture. Let your light shine.
When President Thomas S.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a glorious sight you are! Its an honor, my young friends, to be here with you. I feel the tremendous weight of the responsibility which is mine to provide you with a message which will hopefully be helpful to you not only for today but, indeed, throughout your lives.
As I gaze at this vast audience, Im reminded that each of you is one of a kind. Each has had experiences unique to you and you alone. You have come to Brigham Young University from locations across the country and the world. You come from varied backgrounds. And yet there is much that we have in common one with another. We know where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we leave this life. We know that we are children of our Heavenly Father and that He loves us. We know we want to return to Him after we leave this earthly existence. We know that what we do - and dont do - here in mortality is of utmost importance. We also know that, should we fall short, our Savior has provided us with the precious gift of the Atonement and that, if we change our lives and our hearts and take advantage of the power of the Atonement, our sins and shortcomings will be forgiven and forgotten.
We have in common the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we know it is our responsibility to share the truths of the gospel with others. One of the chief ways in which we can share the gospel is to be a righteous example, and it is about this that I wish to speak to you today. The Apostle Paul admonished, "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."1 He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be "as lights in the world."2
This is what I would hope for each of us - that we might be a light to the world.
What is light? Websters dictionary lists no less than fifteen definitions for the noun light. I prefer the simple "something that illuminates." Just as turning on a light switch in a dark room will bathe the room in light, so providing an example of righteousness - and therefore being a light - can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.
Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. Said President Harold B. Lee:
Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God - that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed. Moroni spoke of [that light,] that Spirit when he said:
"For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises. And, I have to say, you are an awesome sight! My oldest daughter, Mackenzie, is graduating today, so I am especially grateful to be here to express my appreciation for this university and the personal joy our family experiences through having children attend BYU.
Kathy Christensen, the recipient of a scholarship at BYU, thanked her donors by expressing this thought:
I felt an intense gratitude warm my heart. There is nowhere else I would rather be. BYU has provided an environment in which I have been able to flourish. I have been challenged academically, pushed physically and stretched spiritually. ["Your Gifts Bless Generations," insert, Annual Giving quarterly mailing]
I hope you feel, too, that you have been inspired and enlightened by your BYU experience. President Hinckley called BYU a remarkable place. I know it is. I hope you feel that as well.
Congratulations on being a graduate of BYU. You have worked hard and passed many tests - some academic and some in other aspects of your lives. As alumni of BYU, it now becomes your responsibility to take BYU with you, to stay engaged with the university, and to return your talent and resources to BYU.
It was 5:30 a.m. on a day in December 2004 when
Bronco Mendenhall, then the second-youngest Division I head football coach in America, stepped into his office on the still-dark second floor of the Student Athlete Building for his first full day on the job. There was nothing on his desk or shelves. "It was a surreal experience. I was wondering, What have I done? and, What do I do now?" he recalls. "I found myself on my knees within minutes."
Sometime around 8 a.m. a knock interrupted his prayer. At his door stood the patriarch of BYU football, LaVell Edwards (EdD 78). Edwards set a chair directly in front of Mendenhalls chair, and the two sat down, knee to knee.
"[LaVell Edwards] first words were You have a tough job. Then there was a pause and silence," says Mendenhall. "It wasnt very comforting to hear that. But then [LaVell] just said, But its a great job. I didnt know what he meant by either at the time."
Mendenhall has come to consider [Coach] Edwards a mentor and an advocate. "Its nice to have someone who has done the job better than anyone, who clearly understands what its like to be a head coach here." The relationship has helped Mendenhall frame what a BYU football team ought to be. [Peter B. Gardner, "The Bronco Way," BYU Magazine, winter 2007, 2223]
Coach Edwards was a mentor for Coach Mendenhall. Mentoring is one of the best experiences a student can have at BYU. It can happen anywhere, and it is very powerful. For those who will be staying close to the university, co</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">His reputation for concern for the one - particularly the widow or the wounded, the poor or the persecuted - is widely known. Perhaps you would also like to know, if you dont already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear for now.
When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.
As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, I recalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monsons close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because Im sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, Id like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.
When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didnt know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.
I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.
Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions a</span>
