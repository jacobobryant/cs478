  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="What an amazing sight you are this morning! What a vibrant spirit you exude - so full of life and energy and hope for the future. I am so glad to be here with you today.

In case some of you may not have noticed, today is Valentines Day. And of course, that being the case, our thoughts turn to love.

Love is such a wonderful thing. And there are many types of love. Love, as it is defined by the world, can be misguided, frivolous, and selfish. For instance, we may love chocolate, love shoes, or love a good joke. While appropriately enjoying and benefiting from the things of the world is part of Gods plan for us, we must be sure that we keep our desire and "love" for these things in balance with lifes more important blessings. The love for material things can sidetrack us from seeking those things that bring eternal happiness.

Worldly "love" between people is ofttimes nothing more than lust. This kind of love brings dissatisfaction, misery, and sorrow.

On the other hand, Gods love is pure. True love as described by the prophets is deep devotion, affection, adoration, mercy, forgiveness, service, grace, gratitude, and kindness. Real love motivates us to be the best we can be. It is the most powerful force on the earth and can bring great joy and happiness. Pure love is a gift from God and is at the very foundation of His gospel. While Gods love for us is perfect, our love for Him is constantly being redefined as we learn, grow, and experience.

Today I would like to share a few thoughts about this kind of love - Gods love.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two Great Commandments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The Savior has directed our understanding. In the book of Matthew, Jesus was asked:

&lt;i&gt;Master, which is the great commandment in the law?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;This is the first and great commandment.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&lt;/i&gt; [Matthew 22:3639]

In order to understand how to keep these two great commandments, we have to first understand our relationship with our Heavenly Father and we have to understand His love for us.

We are our Heavenly Fathers children. It is as we learn in the favorite Primary song: "I am a child of God, And he has sent me here" (&lt;i&gt;Songbook,&lt;/i&gt; 2). He loves us because we &lt;i&gt;are.&lt;/i&gt; He loves us with a perfect love that we cannot earn or destroy. Now, to be sure, we can disappoint Him and we can cause Him great sorrow. We can forfeit many of His promised blessings if we fail to be obedient. But He will never stop loving us. He loves us with a love that we cannot fully comprehend. He loves us even when we dont deserve it.

The greatest example of Gods love for His children is found in the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ. In John 3:16 we read: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

This means that when we do disappoint Him and make mistakes, there is a way that He has provided whereby we can be forgiven and make our way back to Him.

I am sure that if I were to ask the question "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" that probably all of you would say yes. But let me ask you this: Do you believe Him when He says He gave His life for you so that you might be forgiven of your sins and live with Him and Father in Heaven again? Do you really understand that the Atonement was made for you? Do you believe that you are worth it or worthy of it? Do you believe that anyone could possibly love you that much? I want to assure you today that you are worth it! You are loved more than you will ever know, and as we turn to our Heavenly Father in our times of need, we most assuredly can feel of His love.

Do you remember the story in John 8 of the woman who had been caught in adultery? Surely she must have felt very unworthy of Jesus forgiveness, and yet that is exactly what He gave her after all her accusers had departed. "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:11).

Not only did Christ not condemn her, but He gave her the opportunity to repent as He directed her to "go, and sin no more." The love of Christ is a wonderful thing.

Again referring to the two great commandments found in Matthew, we are to love God, to love others, and to love ourselves. Lets begin by looking at how we can love ourselves. It begins by opening our hearts and accepting Gods love, because then and only then can we know who we are and that we are of great worth. Only then will we be able to love ourselves.

What does it mean to love ourselves? Are we talking about being selfish or self-centered? Are we talking about being self-absorbed? No, we are talking about knowing who we are, where we came from, what we are to do, and where we are going. We are talking about appreciating who we are and the blessings and opportunities we have been given. We are talking about a love that gives us the confidence to serve God and our fellowmen.

Do you really understand the difference between loving yourself in a righteous manner and, on the other hand, being selfish and turned inward? Does your life reflect this understanding? If you do understand it, how well do you love yourself? How do you demonstrate that love? Lets explore four ways we can show love for ourselves. As we do so, we will turn to the scriptures, for we are taught in 2 Nephi 32:3 that we are to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Respect Our Bodies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One important way to show love for ourselves is to respect our bodies. What has the Lord said about this? In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 89, we find the Word of Wisdom. In verse 2 it is proclaimed to be "the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days." In this Word of Wisdom we are not only told what not to take into our bodies, we are taught what is good for our health and well-being. Now I am sure that none of you are drinking or smoking, but do you eat the right kinds of food at the right times in order to maintain good health? Are you avoiding fad diets and other foolish practices in order to become and stay thin? Our objective regarding these things should be optimum health rather than weight loss. We are given a great promise if we will keep this Word of Wisdom:

&lt;i&gt;And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 89:1821]

If you really love yourself, you will want all of these promised blessings.

Another principle of good health is exercise. This not only adds to our health but also invigorates the mind. It is a great way to learn discipline.

About now you may be thinking, "Wow, she sounds just like my mom!" Well, I am just like your mom. And let me tell you something: When moms tell us what to do, it is never just because they can - it is because they care and they want the very best for you.

That being the case, I am going to tell you one more thing that is important to do to respect your body, to love yourself. Actually, I am not telling you, the Lord is telling you.

In the Doctrine and Covenants we are taught:

&lt;i&gt;Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 88:124]

Listen again to the blessings associated with this commandment: to not be weary but to have invigorated minds and bodies. These are blessings that I surely need. How about you?

Do you love yourself enough to claim the blessings that are promised if we use wisdom in eating, exercising, sleeping, and practicing general good health habits?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep Ourselves Pure and Clean&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The second way to show love to ourselves is to keep ourselves pure and clean. In 1 Corinthians 3:1617 we read:

&lt;i&gt;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.&lt;/i&gt;

If we really love and respect ourselves, we will do everything to protect ourselves from the influences of the world that would have us defile this temple called our body. Sister Susan Tanner, Young Women general president, taught the following in her October 2005 general conference talk:

&lt;i&gt;Satan . . . tries to do everything he can to get us to abuse or misuse this precious gift&lt;/i&gt; [our body]. &lt;i&gt;He has filled the world with lies and deceptions about the body. He tempts many to defile this great gift of the body through unchastity, immodesty, self-indulgence, and addictions. He seduces some to despise their bodies; others he tempts to worship their bodies.&lt;/i&gt; [Susan W. Tanner, "The Sanctity of the Body," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2005, 13]

Knowing that we are children of God should enable us to make worthy choices when it comes to chastity, modesty, music, activities, and companions. Loving ourselves should enable us to stay clear of those things that, while acceptable and even desired by the world, would undermine our self-worth. All of us have been taught since our youth what it means to keep ourselves morally clean, and Gods rules have not changed. But do we ever find ourselves standing on the very edge of those rules?

Two of my children love to rock climb. They take pictures of their adventures and bring them home to scare me to death. Even though they are roped in and use all the safety measures prescribed, to me they still look like they are in terrible danger. They look like they are barely holding on.

I have thought as I have seen those pictures that I am so glad that they do not make eternal choices in the same manner that they climb rocks. When it comes to keeping the commandments, their choices keep them firmly planted on a solid foundation, well away from the edge of disaster. In John 14:15 we are told, "If ye love me, keep my commandments."

Today we might add, "If you love yourself, keep His commandments."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appreciate Who We Are&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third thing we can do to develop love for ourselves is to appreciate who we are. Give yourself credit for all of the great things you do and have done. Its an interesting exercise to write down on a piece of paper all of your good qualities and then just sit back and look at all you have done. Actually, what we are looking at is what the Lord has done. We owe all that we are to our Heavenly Father.

When we love ourselves, we recognize that our Heavenly Father has given us special gifts. We are each unique. In Doctrine and Covenants 6:10 it says, "Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh from above."

It is so important that we do not compare ourselves to others but rather work to appreciate and develop who we are. It is never too late to be what you might have been (see Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, &lt;i&gt;John Halifax, Gentleman&lt;/i&gt; [1857], chapter 36). Dont ever become discouraged. Set goals, work hard, be patient, and believe that you can do it. My dad always taught me that I could do anything and be anything I wanted to be if I was just willing to work hard enough. We have to work with a purpose. And when you do, and when you understand your potential, you will have the confidence that this knowledge brings. You will be willing to try new things and discover new talents. You will then be free to become all that you can be.

Loving yourself is demonstrated through a life of discipline. You dont have to become disciplined all at once. Remember the principle taught in 2 Nephi 28:30: "line upon line, precept upon precept." Do your best one day at a time - sometimes just one hour at a time. Its okay to start small - but &lt;i&gt;start!&lt;/i&gt; You are in a wonderful place in your life. You have so many opportunities before you. Take advantage of your years here at school. "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).

Now, dont misunderstand, you are young and you should enjoy your life and have fun - but never at the expense of your eternal welfare. Anything that is worth having is going to take some effort. Hard work is the only way to learn and grow, but it is important to balance that with good, wholesome fun.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forgive Ourselves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The fourth way to love ourselves is to forgive ourselves. If we truly love ourselves, we will recognize that when we make mistakes, we can turn to our Father in Heaven and partake of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He will help us to turn our lives around and have the strength to get back on the right path. He loves us and will forgive us if we sincerely repent and change our lives. He will help us forgive ourselves and regain our self-respect and selfworth.

As we love ourselves the way the Lord would have us do, we are prepared to truly love others. Self-love and a love of God should become the foundation upon which a life of love and service to others is based. We have to learn to love ourselves, but then we have to forget ourselves. In Matthew 16:25 we learn, "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."

Loving oneself and yet forgetting oneself may seem contradictory, but it is not. It is a demonstration of the kind of love offered us by the Savior. It is also a demonstration of the kind of love the Savior expects from us to Him and the Father.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Life of Love and Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now, in your busy daily lives, how can you really serve others? There are the obvious ways: accepting calls in your wards, helping someone who is in need, doing service projects, paying fast offerings. But what is it that the Lord really has in mind here?

It occurs to me that many times our service is just a matter of going through the motions. We may do it because we have a sense of duty. We may do it because there is no one else there to do it. We may do it so we can check it off our list. We may do it so we wont feel guilty now. None of these motivations are bad, but is it true service? Is it the kind of service the Lord has in mind? Is it the service that is founded in the pure love of Christ?

This leads us to questions like these: Is my service really based on a love I feel deep in my heart for other people? Who is my neighbor? How can I really love him?

When we serve others just because we are supposed to, we are still serving, and it is true that we grow to love those whom we serve. But drawing close to our Father in Heaven and living worthy of the Holy Ghost in our lives can qualify us with a love that fills our heart and spills out to all those we meet.

Everyone in our lives is our neighbor. Our family is our neighbor. Our roommates are our neighbors. Our friends, our enemies, our acquaintances, and those we have never met - all of these are our neighbors. We demonstrate our love for them by nurturing feelings of tolerance, patience, kindness, helpfulness, and compassion in our hearts as well as in our actions. We overcome critical, angry feelings toward others. We look to understand rather than condemn. We accept differences as strengths and we learn from one another.

I experienced this kind of love when I traveled to Africa to do work for the Primary. I had been asked by President Hinckley, when he called me to serve as the Primary general president, to take care of the children of the world. As I prepared for this trip, I felt apprehensive about what I would see there. Would I be able to stand the conditions in which I would see the children? But what I experienced was something totally unexpected. I saw children living in terrible conditions, it is true. I realized that I could do nothing to change that. But, at the same time, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of love for them and a realization of the love that our Heavenly Father feels for them. That love comforted my heart.

Our service may be doing things that really change others lives for the better, or our service can be as simple as a smile that lifts a heavy heart. It can be something that may involve some sacrifice. We may have to forgo something we want in order to serve, protect, or strengthen another. When we do this, our service is sanctified, and we begin to feel the pure love of Christ.

If our life is all about "me," we are missing the point. We are here to love and to serve one another. The motto here at BYU reflects this: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."

We read in Matthew 25:40: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

And the same principle is taught in Mosiah 2:17: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."

As these scriptures tell us, when we love and serve our neighbor, we are showing our love for our Father in Heaven. Our love for Him will never be judged by our words alone. Our actions must follow, and those actions must come from the inside out. They must spring naturally from love. Love for our God, for ourselves, and for others must become the very center of our being. It must become our motivation and our foundation. We can pray for that love. We can work for that love.

Mormon said:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.&lt;/i&gt; [Moroni 7:48]

We began today by reading in Matthew 22. In conclusion, let us turn there again. After the Lord gives us the first two commandments, which are both based on love, He says in verse 40, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

If we can understand the law of love - for God, for others, and for ourselves - we will be able to follow all of the rest of the commandments and teachings in the scriptures and from latter-day prophets. If we can understand pure love that is charity, we will be blessed indeed: "But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him" (Moroni 7:47).

I bear my witness of the truths found in the scriptures. The scriptures are the word of the Lord. I am so grateful for our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, who directs us to read them and to make them a part of our lives. I know that God lives and Jesus is the Christ. I know that They love us and that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I know that as we follow His words, there is a sweet promise, for He has said, "Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love" (D&amp;amp;C 6:20).

May we all feel His love and love Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>What an amazing sight you are this morning! What a vibrant spirit you exude - so full of life and energy and hope for the future. I am so glad to be here with you today.</p>
<p>In case some of you may not have noticed, today is Valentines Day. And of course, that being the case, our thoughts turn to love.</p>
<p>Love is such a wonderful thing. And there are many types of love. Love, as it is defined by the world, can be misguided, frivolous, and selfish. For instance, we may love chocolate, love shoes, or love a good joke. While appropriately enjoying and benefiting from the things of the world is part of Gods plan for us, we must be sure that we keep our desire and "love" for these things in balance with lifes more important blessings. The love for material things can sidetrack us from seeking those things that bring eternal happiness.</p>
<p>Worldly "love" between people is ofttimes nothing more than lust. This kind of love brings dissatisfaction, misery, and sorrow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gods love is pure. True love as described by the prophets is deep devotion, affection, adoration, mercy, forgiveness, service, grace, gratitude, and kindness. Real love motivates us to be the best we can be. It is the most powerful force on the earth and can bring great joy and happiness. Pure love is a gift from God and is at the very foundation of His gospel. While Gods love for us is perfect, our love for Him is constantly being redefined as we learn, grow, and experience.</p>
<p>Today I would like to share a few thoughts about this kind of love - Gods love.</p>
<h2><b>Two Great Commandments</b></h2>
<p>The Savior has directed our understanding. In the book of Matthew, Jesus was asked:</p>
<p><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i></p>
<p><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i></p>
<p><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i></p>
<p><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i> [Matthew 22:3639]</p>
<p>In order to understand how to keep these two great commandments, we have to first understand our relationship with our Heavenly Father and we have to understand His love for us.</p>
<p>We are our Heavenly Fathers children. It is as we learn in the favorite Primary song: "I am a child of God, And he has sent me here" (<i>Songbook,</i> 2). He loves us because we <i>are.</i> He loves us with a perfect love that we cannot earn or destroy. Now, to be sure, we can disappoint Him and we can cause Him great sorrow. We can forfeit many of His promised blessings if we fail to be obedient. But He will never stop loving us. He loves us with a love that we cannot fully comprehend. He loves us even when we dont deserve it.</p>
<p>The greatest example of Gods love for His children is found in the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ. In John 3:16 we read: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>
<p>This means that when we do disappoint Him and make mistakes, there is a way that He has provided whereby we can be forgiven and make our way back to Him.</p>
<p>I am sure that if I were to ask the question "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" that probably all of you would say yes. But let me ask you this: Do you believe Him when He says He gave His life for you so that you might be forgiven of your sins and live with Him and Father in Heaven again? Do you really understand that the Atonement was made for you? Do you believe that you are worth it or worthy of it? Do you believe that anyone could possibly love you that much? I want to assure you today that you are worth it! You are loved more than you will ever know, and as we turn to our Heavenly Father in our times of need, we most assuredly can feel of His love.</p>
<p>Do you remember the story in John 8 of the woman who had been caught in adultery? Surely she must have felt very unworthy of Jesus forgiveness, and yet that is exactly what He gave her after all her accusers had departed. "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:11).</p>
<p>Not only did Christ not condemn her, but He gave her the opportunity to repent as He directed her to "go, and sin no more." The love of Christ is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Again referring to the two great commandments found in Matthew, we are to love God, to love others, and to love ourselves. Lets begin by looking at how we can love ourselves. It begins by opening our hearts and accepting Gods love, because then and only then can we know who we are and that we are of great worth. Only then will we be able to love ourselves.</p>
<p>What does it mean to love ourselves? Are we talking about being selfish or self-centered? Are we talking about being self-absorbed? No, we are talking about knowing who we are, where we came from, what we are to do, and where we are going. We are talking about appreciating who we are and the blessings and opportunities we have been given. We are talking about a love that gives us the confidence to serve God and our fellowmen.</p>
<p>Do you really understand the difference between loving yourself in a righteous manner and, on the other hand, being selfish and turned inward? Does your life reflect this understanding? If you do understand it, how well do you love yourself? How do you demonstrate that love? Lets explore four ways we can show love for ourselves. As we do so, we will turn to the scriptures, for we are taught in 2 Nephi 32:3 that we are to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."</p>
<h2><b>Respect Our Bodies</b></h2>
<p>One important way to show love for ourselves is to respect our bodies. What has the Lord said about this? In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 89, we find the Word of Wisdom. In verse 2 it is proclaimed to be "the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days." In this Word of Wisdom we are not only told what not to take into our bodies, we are taught what is good for our health and well-being. Now I am sure that none of you are drinking or smoking, but do you eat the right kinds of food at the right times in order to maintain good health? Are you avoiding fad diets and other foolish practices in order to become and stay thin? Our objective regarding these things should be optimum health rather than weight loss. We are given a great promise if we will keep this Word of Wisdom:</p>
<p><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i></p>
<p><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i></p>
<p><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i></p>
<p><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i> [D&amp;C 89:1821]</p>
<p>If you really love yourself, you will want all of these promised blessings.</p>
<p>Another principle of good health is exercise. This not only adds to our health but also invigorates the mind. It is a great way to learn discipline.</p>
<p>About now you may be thinking, "Wow, she sounds just like my mom!" Well, I am just like your mom. And let me tell you something: When moms tell us what to do, it is never just because they can - it is because they care and they want the very best for you.</p>
<p>That being the case, I am going to tell you one more thing that is important to do to respect your body, to love yourself. Actually, I am not telling you, the Lord is telling you.</p>
<p>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are taught:</p>
<p><i>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i> [D&amp;C 88:124]</p>
<p>Listen again to the blessings associated with this commandment: to not be weary but to have invigorated minds and bodies. These are blessings that I surely need. How about you?</p>
<p>Do you love yourself enough to claim the blessings that are promised if we use wisdom in eating, exercising, sleeping, and practicing general good health habits?</p>
<h2><b>Keep Ourselves Pure and Clean</b></h2>
<p>The second way to show love to ourselves is to keep ourselves pure and clean. In 1 Corinthians 3:1617 we read:</p>
<p><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i></p>
<p><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i></p>
<p>If we really love and respect ourselves, we will do everything to protect ourselves from the influences of the world that would have us defile this temple called our body. Sister Susan Tanner, Young Women general president, taught the following in her October 2005 general conference talk:</p>
<p><i>Satan . . . tries to do everything he can to get us to abuse or misuse this precious gift</i> [our body]. <i>He has filled the world with lies and deceptions about the body. He tempts many to defile this great gift of the body through unchastity, immodesty, self-indulgence, and addictions. He seduces some to despise their bodies; others he tempts to worship their bodies.</i> [Susan W. Tanner, "The Sanctity of the Body," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2005, 13]</p>
<p>Knowing that we are children of God should enable us to make worthy choices when it comes to chastity, modesty, music, activities, and companions. Loving ourselves should enable us to stay clear of those things that, while acceptable and even desired by the world, would undermine our self-worth. All of us have been taught since our youth what it means to keep ourselves morally clean, and Gods rules have not changed. But do we ever find ourselves standing on the very edge of those rules?</p>
<p>Two of my children love to rock climb. They take pictures of their adventures and bring them home to scare me to death. Even though they are roped in and use all the safety measures prescribed, to me they still look like they are in terrible danger. They look like they are barely holding on.</p>
<p>I have thought as I have seen those pictures that I am so glad that they do not make eternal choices in the same manner that they climb rocks. When it comes to keeping the commandments, their choices keep them firmly planted on a solid foundation, well away from the edge of disaster. In John 14:15 we are told, "If ye love me, keep my commandments."</p>
<p>Today we might add, "If you love yourself, keep His commandments."</p>
<h2><b>Appreciate Who We Are</b></h2>
<p>The third thing we can do to develop love for ourselves is to appreciate who we are. Give yourself credit for all of the great things you do and have done. Its an interesting exercise to write down on a piece of paper all of your good qualities and then just sit back and look at all you have done. Actually, what we are looking at is what the Lord has done. We owe all that we are to our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>When we love ourselves, we recognize that our Heavenly Father has given us special gifts. We are each unique. In Doctrine and Covenants 6:10 it says, "Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh from above."</p>
<p>It is so important that we do not compare ourselves to others but rather work to appreciate and develop who we are. It is never too late to be what you might have been (see Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, <i>John Halifax, Gentleman</i> [1857], chapter 36). Dont ever become discouraged. Set goals, work hard, be patient, and believe that you can do it. My dad always taught me that I could do anything and be anything I wanted to be if I was just willing to work hard enough. We have to work with a purpose. And when you do, and when you understand your potential, you will have the confidence that this knowledge brings. You will be willing to try new things and discover new talents. You will then be free to become all that you can be.</p>
<p>Loving yourself is demonstrated through a life of discipline. You dont have to become disciplined all at once. Remember the principle taught in 2 Nephi 28:30: "line upon line, precept upon precept." Do your best one day at a time - sometimes just one hour at a time. Its okay to start small - but <i>start!</i> You are in a wonderful place in your life. You have so many opportunities before you. Take advantage of your years here at school. "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 88:118).</p>
<p>Now, dont misunderstand, you are young and you should enjoy your life and have fun - but never at the expense of your eternal welfare. Anything that is worth having is going to take some effort. Hard work is the only way to learn and grow, but it is important to balance that with good, wholesome fun.</p>
<h2><b>Forgive Ourselves</b></h2>
<p>The fourth way to love ourselves is to forgive ourselves. If we truly love ourselves, we will recognize that when we make mistakes, we can turn to our Father in Heaven and partake of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He will help us to turn our lives around and have the strength to get back on the right path. He loves us and will forgive us if we sincerely repent and change our lives. He will help us forgive ourselves and regain our self-respect and selfworth.</p>
<p>As we love ourselves the way the Lord would have us do, we are prepared to truly love others. Self-love and a love of God should become the foundation upon which a life of love and service to others is based. We have to learn to love ourselves, but then we have to forget ourselves. In Matthew 16:25 we learn, "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."</p>
<p>Loving oneself and yet forgetting oneself may seem contradictory, but it is not. It is a demonstration of the kind of love offered us by the Savior. It is also a demonstration of the kind of love the Savior expects from us to Him and the Father.</p>
<h2><b>A Life of Love and Service</b></h2>
<p>Now, in your busy daily lives, how can you really serve others? There are the obvious ways: accepting calls in your wards, helping someone who is in need, doing service projects, paying fast offerings. But what is it that the Lord really has in mind here?</p>
<p>It occurs to me that many times our service is just a matter of going through the motions. We may do it because we have a sense of duty. We may do it because there is no one else there to do it. We may do it so we can check it off our list. We may do it so we wont feel guilty now. None of these motivations are bad, but is it true service? Is it the kind of service the Lord has in mind? Is it the service that is founded in the pure love of Christ?</p>
<p>This leads us to questions like these: Is my service really based on a love I feel deep in my heart for other people? Who is my neighbor? How can I really love him?</p>
<p>When we serve others just because we are supposed to, we are still serving, and it is true that we grow to love those whom we serve. But drawing close to our Father in Heaven and living worthy of the Holy Ghost in our lives can qualify us with a love that fills our heart and spills out to all those we meet.</p>
<p>Everyone in our lives is our neighbor. Our family is our neighbor. Our roommates are our neighbors. Our friends, our enemies, our acquaintances, and those we have never met - all of these are our neighbors. We demonstrate our love for them by nurturing feelings of tolerance, patience, kindness, helpfulness, and compassion in our hearts as well as in our actions. We overcome critical, angry feelings toward others. We look to understand rather than condemn. We accept differences as strengths and we learn from one another.</p>
<p>I experienced this kind of love when I traveled to Africa to do work for the Primary. I had been asked by President Hinckley, when he called me to serve as the Primary general president, to take care of the children of the world. As I prepared for this trip, I felt apprehensive about what I would see there. Would I be able to stand the conditions in which I would see the children? But what I experienced was something totally unexpected. I saw children living in terrible conditions, it is true. I realized that I could do nothing to change that. But, at the same time, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of love for them and a realization of the love that our Heavenly Father feels for them. That love comforted my heart.</p>
<p>Our service may be doing things that really change others lives for the better, or our service can be as simple as a smile that lifts a heavy heart. It can be something that may involve some sacrifice. We may have to forgo something we want in order to serve, protect, or strengthen another. When we do this, our service is sanctified, and we begin to feel the pure love of Christ.</p>
<p>If our life is all about "me," we are missing the point. We are here to love and to serve one another. The motto here at BYU reflects this: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."</p>
<p>We read in Matthew 25:40: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</p>
<p>And the same principle is taught in Mosiah 2:17: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."</p>
<p>As these scriptures tell us, when we love and serve our neighbor, we are showing our love for our Father in Heaven. Our love for Him will never be judged by our words alone. Our actions must follow, and those actions must come from the inside out. They must spring naturally from love. Love for our God, for ourselves, and for others must become the very center of our being. It must become our motivation and our foundation. We can pray for that love. We can work for that love.</p>
<p>Mormon said:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</i> [Moroni 7:48]</p>
<p>We began today by reading in Matthew 22. In conclusion, let us turn there again. After the Lord gives us the first two commandments, which are both based on love, He says in verse 40, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."</p>
<p>If we can understand the law of love - for God, for others, and for ourselves - we will be able to follow all of the rest of the commandments and teachings in the scriptures and from latter-day prophets. If we can understand pure love that is charity, we will be blessed indeed: "But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him" (Moroni 7:47).</p>
<p>I bear my witness of the truths found in the scriptures. The scriptures are the word of the Lord. I am so grateful for our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, who directs us to read them and to make them a part of our lives. I know that God lives and Jesus is the Christ. I know that They love us and that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I know that as we follow His words, there is a sweet promise, for He has said, "Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love" (D&amp;C 6:20).</p>
<p>May we all feel His love and love Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">How many of you recall seeing the great arch of the Milky Way span the sky over your head, along with millions of other stars that cover the dome of the heavens?
Because I live in a city, one of the things that I forget is the glory of that night sky stretching from one horizon to the other. Prior to the industrialization of society, a view of the night sky filled with stars would have been common. It is breathtaking to realize that the stars seen from Earth are only a few of the stars in our Milky Way Galaxy, which is estimated to contain on the order of 300 billion stars.
Sometime back our friends who have a cabin in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado invited us to a star party in which a group gathered with telescopes far from city lights to view interesting features such as planets in our own solar system and nebulae in our galaxy, as well as the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbor. The telescopes ranged in size from small refracting telescopes on tripods to large reflecting telescopes that required a ladder to get to the eyepiece. As powerful as these amateur telescopes were, astronomy research requires much more powerful instruments.
One of those powerful instruments is the Hubble Space Telescope, built in 1990. It orbits about 350 miles above the earth, far above the interference of the atmosphere. Hubbles mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter, and the entire telescope weighs more than ten tons. Since its launch it has made more than one million observations, resulting in more than 100 terabytes of data. Astronomers from all over the world use the Hubble in their research. Many of you have likely seen images from the Hubble.
Even amateur telescopes can capture a detailed view of Saturn, but the Hubble Telescope is able to catch colorful views of Saturn in wavelengths not visible to the human eye. Saturn is, in my view, the most beautiful planet in our solar system, and it lies only about 1.1 light-hours from Earth at its nearest approach.
Although viewing the planets of our own solar system has yielded spectacular results, the Hubble isnt limited to close-range objects.
Looking beyond our solar system, the Hubble Telescope has captured images of the Ring Nebula, located about 2,000 light-years from Earth, that shows the varying colors of each ring of debris from the supernova that created the nebula thousands of years ago. C. Robert ODell noted that
the nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, its like a jelly doughnut, because its filled with material in the middle. . . . With Hubbles detail, we see a completely different shape than whats been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought. [Quoted in "Hubble Reveals the Ring Nebulas True Shape," NASA, 23 May 2013, nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/ring</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I testify that God, our Heavenly Father, loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son, Jesus Christ. Like Alma, "I testify unto you that I do know that these things . . . are true. . . . They are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God" (Alma 5:4546). I know these things because of my own journey. And if Heavenly Father loves me and knows of me - since He is no respecter of persons - He loves you as well.
My purpose today is to share with you five facets of my testimony that show God loves us. These are simple and quite personal. I pray that your testimony of Gods love for you will grow as you think of your own experiences and that together we may receive the "word of truth" through the Holy Ghost (D&amp;C 50:17). I hope that as I speak, you will contemplate the many ways that God loves you. As I conclude today, I will ask you a question: "So what are you going to do?"
First: I testify that God loves us because He grants unto us the revelator known as the Holy Ghost.
It was October of 1972, a clear and sunny Sunday. I was a freshman at BYU. I rode my bicycle up Provo Canyon to Upper Falls. There I contemplated what in the world I was doing here. You see, I came to BYU as a nonmember. Why? Well, several friends at high school were going to BYU, and they simply invited me along. I applied to BYU, and when my parents and I visited campus, coming from smoggy and dry Southern California, we were sold. I knew very little about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints except that they didnt smoke or drink.
I had arrived on campus a week or so early to attend a late summer honors program. There I met my first roommate, Rahn Price. After a long day we were ready to go to sleep in our room in Deseret Towers (may they rest in peace). Then something unusual happened. Rahn rolled out of bed, knelt at his bedside, and prayed silently. I didnt know what to do. I was quite astonished. I finally said my own prayer:
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;
Should I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.
I was done well before he was. Much later, Rahn said that was the most awkward prayer he had ever said. However, Im grateful that he did say that prayer.
As the semester began, I learned about agency from a Book of Mormon teacher named Bruce Hafen. I learned of the Atonement. Although I had grown up in a Christian church and was raised by "goodly parents" (1 Nephi 1:1), these concepts were certainly deeper than the wading pool of doctrine I had grown up with.
Once the semester began, my friends in Helaman Halls invited me to church, but I respectfully declined. They did not pester me or make me feel out of place. On Sundays I would just do my ow</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a pleasure to welcome all of you back to Brigham Young University in 2006. It is a new year and a time for many resolutions to improve and change, but hopefully most of these are made throughout the year when needed and appropriate. For all of you 2006 is a year for realizing countless opportunities, setting goals, and anticipating accomplishments. It will present many choices and decisions for you. They are yours to grasp, make, and lead you forward - if you always remember to seek and do the Lords will amidst the challenges and excitement of life each and every day. It is both my husbands and my wish that this year of your time here at the university will be a wonderful and successful one.
It was a little over a year ago when the devastating tsunami occurred in parts of Asia. We were all shocked and saddened by this news. Our hearts were deeply touched as we witnessed the devastation and loss of life as well the examples of compassion and goodness of people throughout the world seeking to help those who were suffering. A few days following the tragedy, I was watching a television program that was describing and discussing the tsunami and its aftermath. I cant recall the names or titles of the participants on the program; however, I vividly recall - and have never forgotten - a response to a question by the commentator given by a woman associated with and knowledgeable about the efforts being done to help the victims as well as to account for those who had lost their lives.
The interviewer put forth this question: "Can you give an estimate of how many lives have probably been lost as a result of this natural disaster?"
Her response was, "In many parts of the area where much damage was done, people are not counted in life; therefore, it is impossible to count them in death."
My first thought after a short and shocked hesitation - caused by the bluntness of her answer - was: "You are wrong. You neither are knowledgeable about nor understand the Lords magnificent plan of salvation. If only you really knew that our Heavenly Father counts each one of these men, women, and children as His son or daughter."
We are instructed in the Doctrine and Covenants and reassured many, many times throughout the scriptures to "remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&amp;C 18:10). These souls include those who may never have had the opportunity in mortality to hear the message of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the principles of the gospel it teaches. As I listened to that program, I was so thankful for my testimony of these principles and the knowledge that all who have lived, are living, and will yet live in this earthly realm are sons and daughters of a loving Father in Heaven.
There have been times in my life when I have been in the midst of hundreds or thousands of people: for example, at a football game in LaVell Edwards Stadium, with 65,000 people screaming and c</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear brothers and sisters, it is thrilling to be with you today. I bring you greetings from President Hinckley and the First Presidency. Sister McMullin and I marvel over the goodness of your lives and the potential you represent. It is humbling to realize that Heavenly Father has selected you to come forth in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.
I should like to tell you a story. If you have already heard something similar, no matter - the moral is worth revisiting. As the story goes, the airline company Air France opened an office in Atlanta, Georgia. Some weeks later, the companys chief officer called the Atlanta office. A receptionist answered and, in her charming Southern accent, said, "Air France."
The proper Frenchman was disturbed. Speaking to the office manager, he said, "We cannot have someone answering the phone Air France; it must be Air France!"
Some weeks later, the company executive called again. The same receptionist answered the phone. She said, "Air France - can I hep ya?"
The moral is clear. It is much easier to dress up the outside than to change what is within. It is easier to put on an appearance than it is to alter ones nature. Today I hope to be helpful in changing our natures, in lifting us above the things of this world to "a more excellent way" (Ether 12:11).
You are living in a momentous day in the history of this modern world. Much is expected of you. Your interests and challenges run the gamut from the sciences to the humanities, from the newest discoveries to the most ancient studies. Neither solar systems nor DNA escape your inquisitive probing. Furthermore, that which was arduous for your predecessors you now accomplish in nanoseconds. You are at the forefront of change. Such is the nature of your day and time.
Unfortunately there is a darker side as well. Exciting and beneficial advances are often eclipsed by things sordid and sensual. Concerning today, the scriptures speak of false Christs and false prophets; nations at war; kingdoms arrayed against each other; famines, plagues, earthquakes, and hailstorms; even cataclysmic events that will shake the very orbs and powers of heaven (see JS - M 1:2934).
On a personal level, the Lord speaks of conditions and dangers besetting His covenant people. We read:
For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;
They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall. [D&amp;C 1:1516]
This, too, is part of your day and time.
In todays world much is said about being holistic in ones approach and empowered in on</span>
