  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="One of my favorite religious hymns was written in 1757 by Robert Robinson. The melodic stanzas of the song “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” bring a certain reflective feeling that prompts me to ponder the love that God has for His children. Each time I hear this hymn I find myself humming the tune throughout the day with the words playing in my mind.

I have always found the first phrase of the second verse to be particularly curious: “Here I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I’ve come” (“Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Thou_Fount_of_Every_Blessing).

“Here I raise my Ebenezer”? What is the meaning behind this phrase? Certainly it is not a reference to the resurrection of the lead character in Charles Dickens’ &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol—&lt;/i&gt;Ebenezer Scrooge. But admittedly that was my only reference to the word.

It is in the Old Testament that we gain further understanding of what it means to “raise my Ebenezer.” In 1 Samuel 7 we read that the Israelites were under attack by the Philistines. Outnumbered and in fear for their lives, they pled with the prophet Samuel to pray for God’s help. Samuel offered a sacrifice and prayed for protection. In response the Lord smote the Philistines, and they retreated to their territory. This victory is recorded in verse 12: “Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.”

In Hebrew the word &lt;i&gt;ebenezer&lt;/i&gt; means “stone of help.” This raised stone was a reminder to the Israelites of what the Lord had done for them. This Eben-ezer quite literally was a monument set to remember the great help that God granted the one raising the stone. The Old Testament is replete with examples of the children of Israel forgetting the many miracles and spiritual experiences given to them by the Lord.

In an address given to religious educators, President Spencer W. Kimball said that &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; could be the most important word in the dictionary (see “Circles of Exaltation,” BYU summer school devotional address, 28 June 1968, 8). This is a strong statement that gives us pause to reflect on why a modern-day prophet would make such a deliberate and specific reference to the importance of one word. Today my comments will be centered on this very principle—more specifically, on the importance and value of remembering our own spiritual experiences and recognizing that these experiences, given to us by the Lord, have brought us to where each of us is today. In other words, by remembering we are raising our own Ebenezer.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raising My Own Ebenezer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One such experience in my life took place nearly thirty years ago when I was a young missionary serving in southern Chile. On a warm summer evening in a small Chilean village filled with humble homes linked by dirt roads, my companion and I were engaged in routine missionary activities. Tucked in my pocket was a trifold organizer that contained our calendar for the week. On this particular evening we were scheduled to teach the second discussion to a newly contacted family. We artfully dodged the barefoot children who were playing soccer in the streets. The smoke-filled air was evidence that most people were cooking their evening meal.

As we approached the small house, the children ran to alert their parents that we had arrived. We entered the humble home, and the family gathered for our lesson. In those days the second discussion was the plan of salvation—one of my favorites. As the lesson progressed I made eye contact with the mother and the father and shared my testimony of the truthfulness of this plan. The normally energetic children sat quietly on the knees of their parents. We spoke about how they had lived before coming to earth and about God’s plan for how they could return to live with Him and their family forever.

As my companion gave his portion of the discussion, I had a profound experience. The Spirit touched my heart in a way I had never felt before. At that very moment I could see with great clarity that this family had divine potential. I was overcome with the Spirit and remember feeling that the Holy Ghost was bearing witness to me in a very personal way that the work I was engaged in was true and that God was the author of this plan of salvation.

I did not know at the time if this family was having the same experience, but my feelings were undeniably from God. The sweet witness was profound and clear. At the conclusion of the discussion I felt an urgency to get back to my apartment and record this special experience in my journal. I did not want to forget one detail.

That evening I carefully wrote about my experience, making special note of the spiritual confirmations I had received. I concluded my journal entry that night with the following sentence: “If someday in the future I ever find myself questioning my faith, please read this journal entry!” This experience is an example of a monument that I raised to help me remember what Heavenly Father had done for me.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;“What Mean These Stones?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I remember as a child that each year during the month of April our family would gather around the television on Sunday evenings and watch the annual showing of Cecil B. DeMille’s 1956 production of &lt;i&gt;The Ten Commandments.&lt;/i&gt; Visions of Charlton Heston standing on the mountain with his arms raised high above his head, holding the stone tablets as the wind blew his silver-white hair and red robes, are still present in my memory. Keep in mind that this was before VCR and DVR machines; there was no pausing and no rewinding. It was only during the commercial breaks that we had time to grab a snack or run to get a blanket. Somehow this immediacy made the movie even more exciting to watch. After all, if you missed something you would have to wait another year before you could see it again.

Who could forget the most glorious scene of the movie, when Moses raised his staff and parted the Red Sea? The special effects that were used are impressive even today. With age, my understanding of the story increased, and I began to wonder how the children of Israel could forget so many amazing miracles and return to wickedness.

A lesser-known—but equally meaningful—story of the children of Israel takes place on the banks of the River Jordan. In Joshua 3 we read that, after many years of wandering through the wilderness, the children of Israel were poised to enter the promised land. With Joshua as their leader, the Israelites experienced yet another miracle.

The Lord spoke to Joshua: “This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee” (Joshua 3:7).

As the children of Israel approached the banks of the River Jordan, Joshua was commanded that twelve men—one from each tribe of Israel—should carry the ark of the covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, into the River Jordan. Verse 17 gives a description of what happened as these men walked into the river: “And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.”

Once again the Lord miraculously parted the waters for the children of Israel. However, this time the Lord had additional instructions. After the children of Israel had crossed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua and commanded him that a representative of each tribe pick up a large stone from the dry river bed and stack the stones as a memorial to remember what God had done for them.

&lt;i&gt;And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over.&lt;/i&gt; [Joshua 4:21–23]

It seems the Lord recognized the tendency of the natural man to quickly forget his God. Perhaps this monument would help the Israelites remember the Lord and turn their hearts to Him. I also find it particularly significant that this scripture references that this monument, built by the Israelites, would also stand as a witness to their children, who might ask of its meaning.

This story has great application for us even today. Each experience that we have with the Spirit can be like placing a stone on our own personal monument, reminding us of God’s hand in our lives. These monuments can also serve to strengthen others as we share our experiences.

Some of us may have large, stable monuments that are continually built and fortified with great personal spiritual experiences that acknowledge God. Others may believe that their monuments are small or insignificant—maybe even eroding. If you have these feelings, I invite you to do two things.

First, look to your past and reflect upon your life. You will see the divine guidance of our Heavenly Father and how He has brought you to where you are today.

Second, earnestly seek opportunities and environments in which the Spirit can touch your heart.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reflect upon the Past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As we look to our past we gain insight. Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard proclaimed: “Life must be understood backwards. But . . . it must be lived forwards” (journal entry, 1843). Understanding life by looking backward invites us to reflect upon our past. As we do this with a proper spiritual perspective, we can more clearly see that perhaps seemingly insignificant experiences from our past have set us on a specific path.

Each of us was born into this world with the Light of Christ, and most of us have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost. At some point you have felt the presence of God. Maybe it was through a small prompting to make a particular decision, or maybe you felt a simple witness when someone bore testimony. By recognizing these experiences you are building your own monument. If we do not reflect upon these moments, then we risk forgetting that they ever happened—like the children of Israel did. Allow me to share a personal experience of how an almost-forgotten event in my past suddenly had new meaning.

In my current role as a teacher I have the opportunity to work with students over the course of several years. Through these prolonged associations I have the chance to get to know these students on a more personal level. It is with the permission of one such former student that I share the following story.

In most ways Julie was a typical student. She was bright and articulate, and she enjoyed all the blessings of being raised in the restored gospel. I knew a little of her family background. Her parents were former mission presidents and her siblings were strong in the faith. Julie married a wonderful man who had also been raised in the gospel. I was surprised that they didn’t choose the temple to make their marital covenants, nor did they embrace the gospel in their new life together. I often thought of Julie and her husband and would occasionally see them around town with their growing family. I wondered how they were doing and if they would once again embrace the gospel.

Several years ago I spent an extended amount of time in Nauvoo. I enjoyed visiting the historical sites of the Church and was particularly touched as I stood on the property of one of my ancestors, a pioneer of the Church—James Sawyer Holman. I marveled at the roster that showed the date when he received his temple endowments in the Nauvoo Temple. It became very clear to me that the unwavering faith of James Sawyer Holman and other ancestors had provided me with the blessings of the restored gospel. In my mind’s eye I could see that I was the last link in the chain of a long line of faithful members of the Church. I pondered how different my life would be if one of those ancestors had made different choices. Suddenly it occurred to me that my responsibility was to remain strong in my faith not only for my sake but also for the sake of my children and my posterity. In a new way I understood that my decisions didn’t just affect me.

Several days later, while sitting in my apartment, I continued to ponder this personal revelation. Suddenly the name of this former student—Julie—came to my mind. It had been years since I had seen Julie and her husband or had even thought about them. The thought came to my mind that I should share these thoughts with them, that I should tell them they are links in their own chain for their own posterity. At first I pushed aside these feelings, but as they persisted I followed through and began to write a thoughtful letter. I admit I questioned if what I felt was truly a spiritual prompting or just my own thoughts. I finished the letter and reluctantly sent it, not knowing if I had overstepped my bounds. I received no response.

Several years have passed since I sent the letter, and the original circumstances are now far from my memory. A few months ago my wife came home from the grocery store and said that she had bumped into Julie while shopping.

During their conversation Julie said, “Please tell your husband thank you for the letter he wrote many years ago about being a strong link in our chain. He should know that my husband and I are now married in the temple. My husband is the elders quorum president in our ward, and I am serving in the Young Women organization. We now have an eternal family.”

At first when I was told this I didn’t recall writing the letter, but upon further reflection I did remember the strong feelings many years ago that resulted in my writing the letter. For me this experience is a stone added to my personal monument—one that helps me remember the importance of following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actively Seek to Feel the Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Elder Steven E. Snow of the Quorum of the Seventy said:

&lt;i&gt;When it comes to our own gospel progression, we cannot rely alone on our long-term memory. That is why in all our remembering we must remember to renew. Our testimonies must be continually fed with new spiritual experiences.&lt;/i&gt; [“Remembering and Renewing,” audio, BYU–Idaho devotional address, 12 September 2006]

If my testimony is based upon one spiritual experience I had thirty years ago on my mission, then my testimony is at risk and my monument is in danger of eroding. We must actively seek opportunities and place ourselves in environments where we can feel of the Spirit.

The following example illustrates the importance of choosing to participate in activities and be in environments where the Spirit can be present. Not too long ago my teenage daughter had an opportunity to attend a routine Church fireside on a Sunday evening. I am sure that you will not be surprised when I tell you that this teenager was not excited about getting dressed up again to go to “yet another” Church meeting. However, with constant prodding from her mother and me, she decided to attend.

When she returned home I asked, “So how was the fireside?”

She replied, “It was &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; good. I am really glad that I went.”

She enjoyed the blessings of the Spirit because she placed herself in an environment where the Spirit could be present. Had she not attended the fireside she would have missed an opportunity to build her faith. Choosing to attend your church meetings, attend the temple regularly, read the scriptures, and even attend university devotionals makes it more likely for you to have spiritual experiences. After all, it is hard for the Spirit to bear witness to us of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon if we aren’t reading it.

The inspired document “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” states that “successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1995, 102). As parents, our favorite part of this statement is “forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, [and] work.” However, our kids really like the “recreational activities” part.

Over the years we have enjoyed some very exciting and fun family vacations. In an effort to add value and excitement to the vacation, we have often made the actual announcement of the vacation an event itself. For example, when we traveled to Florida to visit Disney World, we cut out magazine pictures of things like palm trees, the Everglades, and alligators. Each week during family home evening we would present one of these pictures, and the children would try to guess where we were going. Prior to a family vacation to New York we gave the children “I Love New York” T-shirts and had them put them on while in the dark. Then, on the count of three we turned on the lights to reveal the summer vacation plans. It was a thrill to see the excitement in the faces of our children when they discovered where we were headed.

This summer we decided our vacation would be different. Rather than just take a vacation, we wanted to have an experience. We applied to be in the Hill Cumorah Pageant in Palmyra, New York. As parents, we knew that this would be a wonderful experience for our family and an opportunity for them to feel of the Spirit as they portrayed the sacred stories of the Book of Mormon on the very hill where the gold plates had been buried. We also knew that it might not sound as exciting as Disney World or New York City, so we intentionally decided to just let these vacation plans slip out in casual conversation.

My conversation with my fourteen-year-old son went something like this: “Hey, by the way, your Mom and I are so excited that our family has been accepted to be part of the Hill Cumorah Pageant this summer. We will be spending seventeen days in Palmyra, New York. Isn’t that great?”

I curiously awaited his response. As expected, the plans did not elicit the normal outburst of excitement. All I got was a blank stare.

After a long pause he gave me a thoughtful and respectful response. “Dad, no offense,” he said, “but this kind of reminds me of being in second grade, when the teacher comes into class all excited about a field trip to a museum and we just have to slap a smile on our faces and pretend we’re excited as well.” He finished up the conversation by saying, “Are you sure that you and Mom aren’t just wanting to relive your performing glory days?”

I assured him that was not our intent. Quite the opposite, our hope was that our participation in the pageant would place our children in an environment in which they would have an opportunity to have their very own personal and meaningful spiritual experiences. It would be a way for them to build their own testimony and place a stone in their own monument that they would always remember.

The day we arrived at the pageant was particularly hot and humid. We gathered for instructions on how the event would unfold. Within moments we were alive with the idea of portraying the stories of the Book of Mormon on the Hill Cumorah. The children were excited as they received their roles, tried on costumes, and began rehearsals. Those seventeen days were filled with opportunities to feel of the Spirit as we reenacted scenes from the Book of Mormon, visited the Sacred Grove, and relived details of the restored gospel.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Remember, and Perish Not”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Each night as I watched the production unfold from backstage under a starlit sky, I was reminded how much of the turmoil and strife in the Book of Mormon was the result of the people not remembering. Even though Laman and Lemuel had seen angels and had had other heavenly manifestations, they seemingly forgot them and constantly murmured against their father and their brother. In their case the inability to remember resulted in an entire nation turning from God.

Former Church historian and recorder Elder Marlin K. Jensen emphasized the importance of remembering. He said:

&lt;i&gt;If we pay close attention to the uses of the word &lt;b&gt;remember&lt;/b&gt; in the holy scriptures, we will recognize that remembering in the way God intends is a fundamental and saving principle of the gospel. This is so because prophetic admonitions to remember are frequently calls to action: to listen, to see, to do, to obey, to repent. When we remember in God’s way, we overcome our human tendency simply to gird for the battle of life and actually engage in the battle itself, doing all in our power to resist temptation and avoid sinning.&lt;/i&gt; [“Remember and Perish Not,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 2007, 36]

When we think of remembering, it is easy to conjure up an image of an aged man in a rocking chair recalling events of the past. Elder Jensen reminded us that remembering is not enough. Those memories must propel us to action and to continually seek to do the will of our Heavenly Father.

In the book of Mosiah, King Benjamin gave a warning:

&lt;i&gt;But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 4:30]

These final words—“remember, and perish not”—underscore the plea of prophets both modern and old that if we do not want to perish, we must remember. On a personal level this means that our memories of God’s hand in our lives are not only monuments to God but also living testaments that He loves us and is aware of each one of our personal needs.

One of the final scenes of the pageant is the portrayal of the destruction of the Nephite nation. With bodies strewn about the stage and smoke filling the air, Mormon hands the plates to Moroni. Later there is a final plea from Moroni:

&lt;i&gt;And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?&lt;/i&gt; [Moroni 10:27]

A week ago today we returned from the pageant. My once-skeptical son is now earnestly asking if we could please do this again. As we traveled home we all exchanged our favorite quotes from the now-memorized script and spoke of the memories that we would carry with us. We all felt a renewed commitment to nurture future spiritual experiences. In an effort to follow Moroni’s exhortation “to remember these things,” we took time together as a family to write down in our journals what we had experienced and how we felt. These delicate, precious memories deserved all our efforts to preserve them. After all, it is possible that the very recollection of these moments at a yet undetermined time in the future might provide much-needed strength. This experience certainly served as a very large stone in each of our monuments to remember.

As Robert Robinson penned the last verse of “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” he noted the tendency of man forget God:

&lt;i&gt;Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it;
Seal it for Thy courts above.&lt;/i&gt;
[“Come Thou Fount”]

The author of this song died in 1790. It is believed that he had also wandered from the God he loved. A widely told but unverifiable story relates that while he was riding in a stagecoach, a lady passenger sitting next to him was humming the tune of this now well-known hymn. Robinson turned to the lady and responded, saying, “Madam, I am the poor unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds, if I had them, to enjoy the feelings I had then” (see Kenneth W. Osbeck, &lt;i&gt;101 Hymn Stories: The Inspiring True Stories Behind 101 Favorite Hymns&lt;/i&gt; [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Kregel Publications, 1982], 52).

Brothers and sisters, I testify that as we seek opportunities to feel of the Spirit and make efforts to reflect often upon those experiences, we will raise our own Ebenezers—our own stones of remembrance—that will enable us to see God’s hand in our past and will give us assurance and faith that He will provide for us in the future.

I share these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>One of my favorite religious hymns was written in 1757 by Robert Robinson. The melodic stanzas of the song “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” bring a certain reflective feeling that prompts me to ponder the love that God has for His children. Each time I hear this hymn I find myself humming the tune throughout the day with the words playing in my mind.</p>
<p>I have always found the first phrase of the second verse to be particularly curious: “Here I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I’ve come” (“Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Thou_Fount_of_Every_Blessing).</p>
<p>“Here I raise my Ebenezer”? What is the meaning behind this phrase? Certainly it is not a reference to the resurrection of the lead character in Charles Dickens’ <i>A Christmas Carol—</i>Ebenezer Scrooge. But admittedly that was my only reference to the word.</p>
<p>It is in the Old Testament that we gain further understanding of what it means to “raise my Ebenezer.” In 1 Samuel 7 we read that the Israelites were under attack by the Philistines. Outnumbered and in fear for their lives, they pled with the prophet Samuel to pray for God’s help. Samuel offered a sacrifice and prayed for protection. In response the Lord smote the Philistines, and they retreated to their territory. This victory is recorded in verse 12: “Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.”</p>
<p>In Hebrew the word <i>ebenezer</i> means “stone of help.” This raised stone was a reminder to the Israelites of what the Lord had done for them. This Eben-ezer quite literally was a monument set to remember the great help that God granted the one raising the stone. The Old Testament is replete with examples of the children of Israel forgetting the many miracles and spiritual experiences given to them by the Lord.</p>
<p>In an address given to religious educators, President Spencer W. Kimball said that <i>remember</i> could be the most important word in the dictionary (see “Circles of Exaltation,” BYU summer school devotional address, 28 June 1968, 8). This is a strong statement that gives us pause to reflect on why a modern-day prophet would make such a deliberate and specific reference to the importance of one word. Today my comments will be centered on this very principle—more specifically, on the importance and value of remembering our own spiritual experiences and recognizing that these experiences, given to us by the Lord, have brought us to where each of us is today. In other words, by remembering we are raising our own Ebenezer.</p>
<h2><b>Raising My Own Ebenezer</b></h2>
<p>One such experience in my life took place nearly thirty years ago when I was a young missionary serving in southern Chile. On a warm summer evening in a small Chilean village filled with humble homes linked by dirt roads, my companion and I were engaged in routine missionary activities. Tucked in my pocket was a trifold organizer that contained our calendar for the week. On this particular evening we were scheduled to teach the second discussion to a newly contacted family. We artfully dodged the barefoot children who were playing soccer in the streets. The smoke-filled air was evidence that most people were cooking their evening meal.</p>
<p>As we approached the small house, the children ran to alert their parents that we had arrived. We entered the humble home, and the family gathered for our lesson. In those days the second discussion was the plan of salvation—one of my favorites. As the lesson progressed I made eye contact with the mother and the father and shared my testimony of the truthfulness of this plan. The normally energetic children sat quietly on the knees of their parents. We spoke about how they had lived before coming to earth and about God’s plan for how they could return to live with Him and their family forever.</p>
<p>As my companion gave his portion of the discussion, I had a profound experience. The Spirit touched my heart in a way I had never felt before. At that very moment I could see with great clarity that this family had divine potential. I was overcome with the Spirit and remember feeling that the Holy Ghost was bearing witness to me in a very personal way that the work I was engaged in was true and that God was the author of this plan of salvation.</p>
<p>I did not know at the time if this family was having the same experience, but my feelings were undeniably from God. The sweet witness was profound and clear. At the conclusion of the discussion I felt an urgency to get back to my apartment and record this special experience in my journal. I did not want to forget one detail.</p>
<p>That evening I carefully wrote about my experience, making special note of the spiritual confirmations I had received. I concluded my journal entry that night with the following sentence: “If someday in the future I ever find myself questioning my faith, please read this journal entry!” This experience is an example of a monument that I raised to help me remember what Heavenly Father had done for me.</p>
<h2><b>“What Mean These Stones?”</b></h2>
<p>I remember as a child that each year during the month of April our family would gather around the television on Sunday evenings and watch the annual showing of Cecil B. DeMille’s 1956 production of <i>The Ten Commandments.</i> Visions of Charlton Heston standing on the mountain with his arms raised high above his head, holding the stone tablets as the wind blew his silver-white hair and red robes, are still present in my memory. Keep in mind that this was before VCR and DVR machines; there was no pausing and no rewinding. It was only during the commercial breaks that we had time to grab a snack or run to get a blanket. Somehow this immediacy made the movie even more exciting to watch. After all, if you missed something you would have to wait another year before you could see it again.</p>
<p>Who could forget the most glorious scene of the movie, when Moses raised his staff and parted the Red Sea? The special effects that were used are impressive even today. With age, my understanding of the story increased, and I began to wonder how the children of Israel could forget so many amazing miracles and return to wickedness.</p>
<p>A lesser-known—but equally meaningful—story of the children of Israel takes place on the banks of the River Jordan. In Joshua 3 we read that, after many years of wandering through the wilderness, the children of Israel were poised to enter the promised land. With Joshua as their leader, the Israelites experienced yet another miracle.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke to Joshua: “This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee” (Joshua 3:7).</p>
<p>As the children of Israel approached the banks of the River Jordan, Joshua was commanded that twelve men—one from each tribe of Israel—should carry the ark of the covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, into the River Jordan. Verse 17 gives a description of what happened as these men walked into the river: “And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.”</p>
<p>Once again the Lord miraculously parted the waters for the children of Israel. However, this time the Lord had additional instructions. After the children of Israel had crossed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua and commanded him that a representative of each tribe pick up a large stone from the dry river bed and stack the stones as a memorial to remember what God had done for them.</p>
<p><i>And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</i></p>
<p><i>Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</i></p>
<p><i>For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over.</i> [Joshua 4:21–23]</p>
<p>It seems the Lord recognized the tendency of the natural man to quickly forget his God. Perhaps this monument would help the Israelites remember the Lord and turn their hearts to Him. I also find it particularly significant that this scripture references that this monument, built by the Israelites, would also stand as a witness to their children, who might ask of its meaning.</p>
<p>This story has great application for us even today. Each experience that we have with the Spirit can be like placing a stone on our own personal monument, reminding us of God’s hand in our lives. These monuments can also serve to strengthen others as we share our experiences.</p>
<p>Some of us may have large, stable monuments that are continually built and fortified with great personal spiritual experiences that acknowledge God. Others may believe that their monuments are small or insignificant—maybe even eroding. If you have these feelings, I invite you to do two things.</p>
<p>First, look to your past and reflect upon your life. You will see the divine guidance of our Heavenly Father and how He has brought you to where you are today.</p>
<p>Second, earnestly seek opportunities and environments in which the Spirit can touch your heart.</p>
<h2><b>Reflect upon the Past</b></h2>
<p>As we look to our past we gain insight. Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard proclaimed: “Life must be understood backwards. But . . . it must be lived forwards” (journal entry, 1843). Understanding life by looking backward invites us to reflect upon our past. As we do this with a proper spiritual perspective, we can more clearly see that perhaps seemingly insignificant experiences from our past have set us on a specific path.</p>
<p>Each of us was born into this world with the Light of Christ, and most of us have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost. At some point you have felt the presence of God. Maybe it was through a small prompting to make a particular decision, or maybe you felt a simple witness when someone bore testimony. By recognizing these experiences you are building your own monument. If we do not reflect upon these moments, then we risk forgetting that they ever happened—like the children of Israel did. Allow me to share a personal experience of how an almost-forgotten event in my past suddenly had new meaning.</p>
<p>In my current role as a teacher I have the opportunity to work with students over the course of several years. Through these prolonged associations I have the chance to get to know these students on a more personal level. It is with the permission of one such former student that I share the following story.</p>
<p>In most ways Julie was a typical student. She was bright and articulate, and she enjoyed all the blessings of being raised in the restored gospel. I knew a little of her family background. Her parents were former mission presidents and her siblings were strong in the faith. Julie married a wonderful man who had also been raised in the gospel. I was surprised that they didn’t choose the temple to make their marital covenants, nor did they embrace the gospel in their new life together. I often thought of Julie and her husband and would occasionally see them around town with their growing family. I wondered how they were doing and if they would once again embrace the gospel.</p>
<p>Several years ago I spent an extended amount of time in Nauvoo. I enjoyed visiting the historical sites of the Church and was particularly touched as I stood on the property of one of my ancestors, a pioneer of the Church—James Sawyer Holman. I marveled at the roster that showed the date when he received his temple endowments in the Nauvoo Temple. It became very clear to me that the unwavering faith of James Sawyer Holman and other ancestors had provided me with the blessings of the restored gospel. In my mind’s eye I could see that I was the last link in the chain of a long line of faithful members of the Church. I pondered how different my life would be if one of those ancestors had made different choices. Suddenly it occurred to me that my responsibility was to remain strong in my faith not only for my sake but also for the sake of my children and my posterity. In a new way I understood that my decisions didn’t just affect me.</p>
<p>Several days later, while sitting in my apartment, I continued to ponder this personal revelation. Suddenly the name of this former student—Julie—came to my mind. It had been years since I had seen Julie and her husband or had even thought about them. The thought came to my mind that I should share these thoughts with them, that I should tell them they are links in their own chain for their own posterity. At first I pushed aside these feelings, but as they persisted I followed through and began to write a thoughtful letter. I admit I questioned if what I felt was truly a spiritual prompting or just my own thoughts. I finished the letter and reluctantly sent it, not knowing if I had overstepped my bounds. I received no response.</p>
<p>Several years have passed since I sent the letter, and the original circumstances are now far from my memory. A few months ago my wife came home from the grocery store and said that she had bumped into Julie while shopping.</p>
<p>During their conversation Julie said, “Please tell your husband thank you for the letter he wrote many years ago about being a strong link in our chain. He should know that my husband and I are now married in the temple. My husband is the elders quorum president in our ward, and I am serving in the Young Women organization. We now have an eternal family.”</p>
<p>At first when I was told this I didn’t recall writing the letter, but upon further reflection I did remember the strong feelings many years ago that resulted in my writing the letter. For me this experience is a stone added to my personal monument—one that helps me remember the importance of following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<h2><b>Actively Seek to Feel the Spirit</b></h2>
<p>Elder Steven E. Snow of the Quorum of the Seventy said:</p>
<p><i>When it comes to our own gospel progression, we cannot rely alone on our long-term memory. That is why in all our remembering we must remember to renew. Our testimonies must be continually fed with new spiritual experiences.</i> [“Remembering and Renewing,” audio, BYU–Idaho devotional address, 12 September 2006]</p>
<p>If my testimony is based upon one spiritual experience I had thirty years ago on my mission, then my testimony is at risk and my monument is in danger of eroding. We must actively seek opportunities and place ourselves in environments where we can feel of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the importance of choosing to participate in activities and be in environments where the Spirit can be present. Not too long ago my teenage daughter had an opportunity to attend a routine Church fireside on a Sunday evening. I am sure that you will not be surprised when I tell you that this teenager was not excited about getting dressed up again to go to “yet another” Church meeting. However, with constant prodding from her mother and me, she decided to attend.</p>
<p>When she returned home I asked, “So how was the fireside?”</p>
<p>She replied, “It was <i>so</i> good. I am really glad that I went.”</p>
<p>She enjoyed the blessings of the Spirit because she placed herself in an environment where the Spirit could be present. Had she not attended the fireside she would have missed an opportunity to build her faith. Choosing to attend your church meetings, attend the temple regularly, read the scriptures, and even attend university devotionals makes it more likely for you to have spiritual experiences. After all, it is hard for the Spirit to bear witness to us of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon if we aren’t reading it.</p>
<p>The inspired document “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” states that “successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102). As parents, our favorite part of this statement is “forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, [and] work.” However, our kids really like the “recreational activities” part.</p>
<p>Over the years we have enjoyed some very exciting and fun family vacations. In an effort to add value and excitement to the vacation, we have often made the actual announcement of the vacation an event itself. For example, when we traveled to Florida to visit Disney World, we cut out magazine pictures of things like palm trees, the Everglades, and alligators. Each week during family home evening we would present one of these pictures, and the children would try to guess where we were going. Prior to a family vacation to New York we gave the children “I Love New York” T-shirts and had them put them on while in the dark. Then, on the count of three we turned on the lights to reveal the summer vacation plans. It was a thrill to see the excitement in the faces of our children when they discovered where we were headed.</p>
<p>This summer we decided our vacation would be different. Rather than just take a vacation, we wanted to have an experience. We applied to be in the Hill Cumorah Pageant in Palmyra, New York. As parents, we knew that this would be a wonderful experience for our family and an opportunity for them to feel of the Spirit as they portrayed the sacred stories of the Book of Mormon on the very hill where the gold plates had been buried. We also knew that it might not sound as exciting as Disney World or New York City, so we intentionally decided to just let these vacation plans slip out in casual conversation.</p>
<p>My conversation with my fourteen-year-old son went something like this: “Hey, by the way, your Mom and I are so excited that our family has been accepted to be part of the Hill Cumorah Pageant this summer. We will be spending seventeen days in Palmyra, New York. Isn’t that great?”</p>
<p>I curiously awaited his response. As expected, the plans did not elicit the normal outburst of excitement. All I got was a blank stare.</p>
<p>After a long pause he gave me a thoughtful and respectful response. “Dad, no offense,” he said, “but this kind of reminds me of being in second grade, when the teacher comes into class all excited about a field trip to a museum and we just have to slap a smile on our faces and pretend we’re excited as well.” He finished up the conversation by saying, “Are you sure that you and Mom aren’t just wanting to relive your performing glory days?”</p>
<p>I assured him that was not our intent. Quite the opposite, our hope was that our participation in the pageant would place our children in an environment in which they would have an opportunity to have their very own personal and meaningful spiritual experiences. It would be a way for them to build their own testimony and place a stone in their own monument that they would always remember.</p>
<p>The day we arrived at the pageant was particularly hot and humid. We gathered for instructions on how the event would unfold. Within moments we were alive with the idea of portraying the stories of the Book of Mormon on the Hill Cumorah. The children were excited as they received their roles, tried on costumes, and began rehearsals. Those seventeen days were filled with opportunities to feel of the Spirit as we reenacted scenes from the Book of Mormon, visited the Sacred Grove, and relived details of the restored gospel.</p>
<h2><b>“Remember, and Perish Not”</b></h2>
<p>Each night as I watched the production unfold from backstage under a starlit sky, I was reminded how much of the turmoil and strife in the Book of Mormon was the result of the people not remembering. Even though Laman and Lemuel had seen angels and had had other heavenly manifestations, they seemingly forgot them and constantly murmured against their father and their brother. In their case the inability to remember resulted in an entire nation turning from God.</p>
<p>Former Church historian and recorder Elder Marlin K. Jensen emphasized the importance of remembering. He said:</p>
<p><i>If we pay close attention to the uses of the word <b>remember</b> in the holy scriptures, we will recognize that remembering in the way God intends is a fundamental and saving principle of the gospel. This is so because prophetic admonitions to remember are frequently calls to action: to listen, to see, to do, to obey, to repent. When we remember in God’s way, we overcome our human tendency simply to gird for the battle of life and actually engage in the battle itself, doing all in our power to resist temptation and avoid sinning.</i> [“Remember and Perish Not,” <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 36]</p>
<p>When we think of remembering, it is easy to conjure up an image of an aged man in a rocking chair recalling events of the past. Elder Jensen reminded us that remembering is not enough. Those memories must propel us to action and to continually seek to do the will of our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>In the book of Mosiah, King Benjamin gave a warning:</p>
<p><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i> [Mosiah 4:30]</p>
<p>These final words—“remember, and perish not”—underscore the plea of prophets both modern and old that if we do not want to perish, we must remember. On a personal level this means that our memories of God’s hand in our lives are not only monuments to God but also living testaments that He loves us and is aware of each one of our personal needs.</p>
<p>One of the final scenes of the pageant is the portrayal of the destruction of the Nephite nation. With bodies strewn about the stage and smoke filling the air, Mormon hands the plates to Moroni. Later there is a final plea from Moroni:</p>
<p><i>And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?</i> [Moroni 10:27]</p>
<p>A week ago today we returned from the pageant. My once-skeptical son is now earnestly asking if we could please do this again. As we traveled home we all exchanged our favorite quotes from the now-memorized script and spoke of the memories that we would carry with us. We all felt a renewed commitment to nurture future spiritual experiences. In an effort to follow Moroni’s exhortation “to remember these things,” we took time together as a family to write down in our journals what we had experienced and how we felt. These delicate, precious memories deserved all our efforts to preserve them. After all, it is possible that the very recollection of these moments at a yet undetermined time in the future might provide much-needed strength. This experience certainly served as a very large stone in each of our monuments to remember.</p>
<p>As Robert Robinson penned the last verse of “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” he noted the tendency of man forget God:</p>
<p><i>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,<br />
Prone to leave the God I love;<br />
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it;<br />
Seal it for Thy courts above.</i><br />
[“Come Thou Fount”]</p>
<p>The author of this song died in 1790. It is believed that he had also wandered from the God he loved. A widely told but unverifiable story relates that while he was riding in a stagecoach, a lady passenger sitting next to him was humming the tune of this now well-known hymn. Robinson turned to the lady and responded, saying, “Madam, I am the poor unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds, if I had them, to enjoy the feelings I had then” (see Kenneth W. Osbeck, <i>101 Hymn Stories: The Inspiring True Stories Behind 101 Favorite Hymns</i> [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Kregel Publications, 1982], 52).</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that as we seek opportunities to feel of the Spirit and make efforts to reflect often upon those experiences, we will raise our own Ebenezers—our own stones of remembrance—that will enable us to see God’s hand in our past and will give us assurance and faith that He will provide for us in the future.</p>
<p>I share these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In my current assignment as Historian and Recorder for the Church, I have the privilege of working with some incredibly bright people. The Church History Department is housed in the Church History Library, just east of the LDS Conference Center. In this building are located the archives that house a marvelous collection of documents, books, journals, correspondence, film, and other important artifacts. On the fourth floor is a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory where historical artifacts, documents, books, and even textiles are brought so they might be preserved or restored.
Let me share by video some of the work that goes on here: Emiline Twitchell is cleaning off old glue from a book spine that has become hard and inflexible. She is working on an early copy of a Welsh Pearl of Great Price. Katie Smith is removing damaging tape (a four-letter word in document conservation) from the first Relief Society Minute Book. She is also washing an early LDS Danish journal to restore it to its near original condition. Here she is sewing back together the original Mayfield, Utah, Relief Society Minute Book.
In older books the spine often breaks and needs replacing. Here Katie is preparing leather for a replacement spine for a book. This is called rebacking and involves adding new material under the original cover to compensate for the failing spine. Here you see she is working on a first-edition copy of the Book of Mormon that is undergoing this process of adding the leather to reinforce the spine. Finally, here is a finished book in which the spine has been reattached over the new material underneath. In this case the book is another Relief Society record from the nineteenth century.
Restoration work can be tedious and time consuming, but the results can be stunning. I am so pleased we have professionals who are dedicated to preserving our past by restoring these important elements of our history.
This is only part of the work of the Church History Department. Besides the library, where most of the precious documents, books, newspapers, and film are stored, the Church has the Church History Museum, where important artifacts are displayed and also stored. The Granite Mountain Records Vault acts as a storage facility for microfilm and digital records. We also have Church history advisors called who serve in their own countries around the world, collecting, preserving, and sharing Church history from their own lands. We work as well with the Missionary Department and other Church entities in the operation and preservation of the historic sites of the Church—from Palmyra, New York, to Martin’s Cove, Wyoming, and from Kirtland, Ohio, to the Mormon Battalion Visitors’ Center in San Diego, California.
In the past several years we have made a tremendous effort to provide Church history offerings online so the stories, documents, and journals might be shared with the entire Church without the necessity of coming to </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I received the call to give a devotional, I accepted the invitation, got off the phone, and knew immediately what—at least some part of what—I would be speaking about today. Then I second-guessed this first impression and considered a whole variety of intellectually provoking things that I might talk about, and I realized that, whatever interesting ideas I might have, they were not the things the Lord was trying to inspire me to speak about.
Maggie, who just offered the prayer, left me a note from some students who had taken a Freshmen Academy class from me a couple of years ago saying that they wished me well in the devotional, thanking me for the class that they had taken, and making reference to a particular story that I had shared with them while I was their teacher. So, I apologize to them because I’m going to be sharing that same story today. In reading their note, I was already moved to tears. I said to my husband, “This is not a good sign; I’m crying even before I’ve started giving the talk.”
What I want to talk to you about today is memory, and more specifically, the idea of us remembering the Lord and the Lord remembering us. I have been thinking a great deal lately about memory and remembering. I suppose this is in part because of the gradual deterioration of my own memory as I get older. I sometimes find myself walking from one end of my house to the other (a very short walk, I might add) and finding that I cannot recall why I came to the new location, although I can recall that I had some very specific purpose in mind when I started out.
You students, I have no doubt, think about memory every time you have the prospect of an examination looming over you, hoping and praying that you will be able to remember everything you have studied and perhaps even—with very good luck and divine intervention—some things you did not.
On a more serious note (although I recognize you may not be able to imagine anything more serious than your looming tests), memory has become especially important to me as in recent months I have witnessed the quite rapid and serious loss of the powers of recall in someone I love very much and who, I assumed, would always remember me: my mother. A change that began slowly a few years ago has so accelerated in recent months that during a trip to see my parents just over a month ago, my own mother, upon first seeing me, did not recognize me. For the first two days of my visit, I needed to remind her repeatedly that I am her daughter. She did eventually recall me more regularly, but all the details of my life—that I am married, that I have children, that I live and work in Utah—remained completely unfamiliar to her. It was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my life when my mother looked at me and did not know me.
In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne was the personification of memory. She was the mother of the Nine Muses. The Muses were the goddesses w</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My dear friends, over the years I have spoken many times to generations of students who have assembled in this great Marriott Center. Today, if you will bear with me, I think I shall change the pattern of those previous addresses. Whether that change will be acceptable or not will depend on you. Furthermore, it is Halloween, and that calls for something a little different, though I don’t know why it should.
As all of you recognize, I am now an old man who has weathered many seasons and been touched and affected by many experiences. Emerson was once asked what books he had read that had most influenced his life. He replied that he could no more remember the books he had read than the meals he had eaten, but they had made him.
And so, in the spirit of what Emerson said, rather than giving a speech I have thought to offer several brief cameos or vignettes or seemingly little experiences that I remember from out of the past and that have touched my life in an unforgettable manner. They have all been published, and some of you may be familiar with them. They will not be in chronological order.
I begin with number one.
I was in the city of Torreó, Mexico, and was being driven about in a beautiful and expensive automobile. It belonged to a man named David Casteñ. At one time he and his wife and their children lived on a little rundown farm. They owned 30 chickens, two pigs, and one skinny horse. They walked in poverty.
Then one day two missionaries called on them. Sister Casteñ said, “The elders took the blinders from our eyes and brought light into our lives. We knew nothing of Jesus Christ. We knew nothing of God until they came.”
They moved into the little town of Bermejillo. Circumstances led them to the junk business. They bought wrecked automobiles. This led to association with insurance companies. They gradually built a prosperous business in which the father and his five sons worked. With simple faith they paid their tithing. They lived the gospel. They served wherever they were called. Four of their sons and three of their daughters filled missions.
Through their influence some 200 of their family and friends have joined the Church. More than 30 sons and daughters of family and friends have served missions. They donated the land on which a chapel now stands. At the time I met them, the children—now grown to maturity—and the parents were taking turns going to Mexico City each month to work in the temple. They are a shining and inspirational example of the miraculous power of missionary work. Think of the wonderful consequences of their being taught and receiving the teachings of the gospel from two humble missionaries. Such miracles are occurring today all across the world.
Now, vignette number two.
I have stood at the tomb of Napoleon in Paris, at the tomb of Lenin in Moscow, and before the burial places of many others of the mighty leaders of the earth. In their tim</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am humbled this morning to share a few words and pray I might say some things that will increase our desire and ability to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for university devotionals. They are a nice break from academic work and let us focus on the weightier matters of the kingdom. I know you students appreciate the chance to get away from writing papers and studying for exams. I have heard how difficult some of those exams can be.
I was told of a zoology professor who is so tough a grader that nobody has ever received an A in his course. Last semester, history was being made because an especially bright student had A’s on the two midterms. If he could get an A on the final he would have the first A in this professor’s class—ever. The final test was on birds, and so the student practically memorized the three chapters on birds. He went to the library, checked out extra readings, and felt ready for anything that might appear on the final.
The day of the final the professor said, “Good morning, students. This is your final exam.” From underneath the table he pulled out three stuffed birds. Each of them was covered with a little hood, and all you could see were the legs and feet poking out from underneath the hoods. He said, “Now, students, looking at the legs and feet of these three specimens, I’d like you to tell me their common names and their scientific names. That’s all you have to do. You have an hour and a half to complete the exam. Begin.”
The class sat absolutely stunned. There are thousands of bird species. How do you identify a bird by looking at the legs and feet? This test was given so nobody would get an A. The student who previously thought he had a shot at getting an A wrote down some names he knew were probably incorrect. He went up, slammed his paper on the professor’s desk, and said, “Sir, that’s the dumbest test I’ve ever taken in my life. I want to tell you something else. You are the most boring lecturer on this campus.”
The professor fumbled for a pen and said, “Just one minute, student. What was your name?”
The student thought for a second, pulled up his pant leg, showed his hairy leg, and said, “Why don’t you tell me?”
Sometimes professors need to be put in their places.
Now I know you appreciate this chance to have a break from academics, but I’m hoping you won’t mind if I pull a short pop quiz to help explore today’s subject. Please answer the following questions in your mind.
Question Number 1: What great event turned around the life of Alma the Younger? If you responded that an angel of God came down and called Alma to repentance, I would give you partial credit. Certainly that was part of the equation. But I think the story more importantly illustrates the power of remembering the Savior and thinking of Him than it illustrates the ability of angels to call us to repentance.
