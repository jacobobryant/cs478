  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Some time ago I was walking in the center of Salt Lake City on my way to City Creek Canyon. A car with an out-of-state license plate was driving by. The driver pulled over and asked, “Where is the church of the Mormons?” I assumed that he was thinking of some place or building. I took time to point out the tall Church Office Building, the stately Church Administration Building, the magnificent temple, and the historic tabernacle (the Conference Center had not yet been built). He thanked me and went on his way.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is It in Our Buildings?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
A few years ago my wife and I were in the temple in Kirtland, Ohio. It was late fall, and the afternoon sun was streaking through the old, wavy, handblown windowpanes. The building was light and airy and magnificent. Since some of my forebears were involved in its construction, I was humbled and honored to be under its roof. Within its walls and under its spell, I was enchanted by its beauty.

However, as President Boyd K. Packer correctly pointed out, “We do not have that building. When our people left, they took with them that which was important. They preserved the keys of the ordinances, the covenants, and the sealing power. They took with them all the essentials which we have today.”

So the Church cannot, in and of itself, be the temples, magnificent as they are, because the temple buildings alone do not bless. They are the exquisite containers for the pearls of great price administered therein by the priesthood of God.

Thanks to my wonderful wife, the Spirit of the Lord has often been in our various dwelling places. While we have lived within them, each has been a holy place for me. In our married life we have lived in single rooms with bathrooms down the hall and in small apartments. We have also owned three different houses. In a sense the Church has been in each, but I would not want to go back and live in our former homes, even though we spent much of our happy lives in them. The kingdom of God is not there.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is It in Our Families?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Is the Church then in our families? We are getting close to the correct answer here. In a sense a family can foster the teachings of the Savior better than any other institution. In large measure the Church exists to strengthen families. I wish to define &lt;i&gt;family &lt;/i&gt;very broadly. In the Church we have traditional families and single-parent families. Furthermore, each single member is considered to be, in a sense, a Church family. We also have ward families in which the bishop serves as a spiritual father.

Because of the erosion of family life and family values, we frequently hear urgent pleas requesting the Church as an organization to take over activities formerly considered family activities. I wonder if our maturing youth can hold everything together without family home evening, daily prayer, and daily scripture study. I say this because I am persuaded that family activities can be more effective in fostering the eternal values of love, loyalty, honesty, chastity, industry, self-worth, and personal integrity than any other institution.

Lou Holtz, the successful football coach from Notre Dame, stated:

&lt;i&gt;The family is where our healthy values are formed and shaped. I know no greater challenge or more important role in life than in preparing our children to take their places as contributing citizens. We cannot relinquish this most important responsibility to gang leaders, drug leaders or even our own government. Nothing can destroy individuals or our country as quickly as drugs. It is not confined to a segment of our society, and it has created more damage than anything else I have witnessed in my lifetime. I have never heard a successful man or woman get up and say, “I owe my success to drugs and alcohol.” Yet I know thousands of people who have said publicly or in the press that they have ruined their lives because of drugs and alcohol. Suffice it to say, government can’t stop it, police can’t&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;but the family can.&lt;/i&gt;

Because of the complexity of the problem of drug and alcohol abuse, some may feel that it is an oversimplification to say that strong family leadership can solve the problem. Certainly not all families can, but I am persuaded that families with enough internal caring, discipline, commitment, and love somehow, someway, can handle the majority of their problems. However strong or weak the family may be, it can usually provide a better solution to most challenges than can any other institution in society or the government no matter how well intentioned it may be.

I believe that the principle reason that a caring family is the best antidote for drug and alcohol abuse and other problems is that unqualified love can flow from kinship relationships. Successful families usually have a strong, caring head. Ideally this would be a holder of the priesthood whose power and influence is maintained “by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41?lang=eng#p40&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 121:41&lt;/a&gt;).

Priesthood is desirable because whomsoever is blessed by this power, God will bless. But there have been many successful caring heads of families who are mothers, grandmothers, and others. What seems to distinguish a successful family is that the members of the family continue to care. They don’t give up. They never quit. They hang together through hardships and death and other problems.

I know of a close-knit family that is wonderfully successful in keeping everyone together. When the parents feel they are losing influence with teenagers, the help of cousins is enlisted to exert some counter peer pressure.

I would urge members of extended families—grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins—to reach out in concern, to succor. Mostly what is needed from grandparents, aunts, and uncles is unreserved love manifest as interest and concern. It builds confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth. Reproving and chastening adult family members should be rare indeed. We are told that it should happen only when a person is moved upon by the Holy Ghost. But I have been grateful for those in my family who have loved me enough to give me both the gentle and strong reproof on occasion as needed. We read in Proverbs: “He that refuseth reproof erreth” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/10.17?lang=eng#p16&quot;&gt;Proverbs 10:17&lt;/a&gt;).

The fact that some members do not have functioning traditional families is no reason to move in a direction that would diminish or abandon family activities among those who can and should foster them. With the increased onslaught of forces that cause families to disintegrate, we ought to dig in our heels to preserve all that is great and good in the family. We are reminded that in times of tribulations, the Nephites were not fighting for a political cause such as monarchy or power; rather, they “were inspired by a better cause, . . . they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.45?lang=eng#p44&quot;&gt;Alma 43:45&lt;/a&gt;). Some may find it strong doctrine, but I quote again from Alma in the Book of Mormon: “And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.47?lang=eng#p46&quot;&gt;Alma 43:47&lt;/a&gt;).

As a corollary to defending the family, we have a duty to teach our family members that the commandments of God may not be broken without drawing a penalty.

President Stephen L Richards said: “I want this taught to youth so that they may comprehend it. It is their due and their right to have these things given to them without dilution or apology. This is justice and mercy. Neither shall rob the other.”

President Richards went on to state that it is no “kindness to any youth to whitewash [various sins such as] lying and deceit,” which are so prevalent today. “Perhaps the greatest of all [is] that robbery which steals virtue from either woman or man” (&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;April 1957, 99).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is It in Our Hearts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
So the family is and must always be an important part of the Church. But the Lord’s kingdom ultimately must be found in our hearts before it can be anywhere else. Paul gave us a key when he said to the Romans: “He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.27?lang=eng#p26&quot;&gt;Romans 8:27&lt;/a&gt;). He also said, “The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.5?lang=eng#p4&quot;&gt;Romans 5:5&lt;/a&gt;).

In the story of David, who was called in his youth to be the future king of Israel, we learn how much the Lord judges by what is in the heart. We all remember how the Lord sent the prophet Samuel to the house of Jesse, saying, “For I have provided me a king among his sons” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.1?lang=eng#primary&quot;&gt;1 Samuel 16:1&lt;/a&gt;). One by one, Jesse had his seven oldest sons pass before Samuel. In considering each one, Samuel was instructed by the Lord to “look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7?lang=eng#p6&quot;&gt;1 Samuel 16:7&lt;/a&gt;). And so, as the seven sons passed before him, Samuel said to Jesse, “The Lord hath not chosen these.”

&lt;i&gt;And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.10-13?lang=eng#p9&quot;&gt;1 Samuel 16:10–13&lt;/a&gt;]

Like Daniel of old, what we do or do not do in life originates in our hearts. As Daniel stood in the court of Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon who captured Jerusalem, “Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.8?lang=eng#p7&quot;&gt;Daniel 1:8&lt;/a&gt;). From then on Daniel held to that purpose. It eventually brought him the highest of heavenly and earthly honors.

The greatness of Willard Richard’s heart was manifest just before the martyrdom of the Prophet:

&lt;i&gt;Joseph said to Dr. Richards, “If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?” The doctor answered, “Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you—you did not ask me to come to Carthage—you did not ask me to come to jail with you—and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.” Joseph said, “You cannot.” The doctor replied, “I will.”&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;HC&lt;/i&gt; 6:616]

Alma teaches us the necessity for having the good seed of faith planted in our hearts:

&lt;i&gt;Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your &lt;/i&gt;heart,&lt;i&gt; behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p27&quot;&gt;Alma 32:28&lt;/a&gt;; emphasis added]

Revelation comes to us in our minds, but it also comes in our hearts. In a revelation to Oliver Cowdery in section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord says, “Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your &lt;i&gt;heart,&lt;/i&gt; by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your &lt;i&gt;heart”&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2?lang=eng#p1&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 8:2&lt;/a&gt;; emphasis added). To me it is very interesting that the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost is in our hearts.

What if the Lord appeared to each of us as He did to Solomon and said, “Ask what I shall give thee”? How would you answer? Would you ask for a new car? A new home? A blessing of health? A station in life? Solomon did not ask for anything like these. Neither did he ask for fame or for fortune. Rather, he responded: “Give therefore thy servant an understanding &lt;i&gt;heart.”&lt;/i&gt; This reply pleased the Lord.

&lt;i&gt;And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding &lt;/i&gt;heart;&lt;i&gt; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. &lt;/i&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3.5,9,11-13?lang=eng#p4&quot;&gt;1 Kings 3:5, 9, 11–13&lt;/a&gt;; emphasis added]

There is some strong language in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants regarding who has claim upon our hearts: “I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.22?lang=eng#p21&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 64:22&lt;/a&gt;).

So when the inquirer in the car with the out-of-state license plate asked, “Where is the church of the Mormons?” I could have answered differently. I could have pointed to my chest and said that the Church should be first and foremost in our hearts. Then the traveler would surely have been somewhat bewildered. But that response would have been more accurate than my directing him to our beloved, magnificent, sky-piercing spires; the great majestic dome; and the other world-famous monuments and edifices—wonderful and unique and great as they are. It would have been more correct because the Lord said, “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.20-21?lang=eng#p19&quot;&gt;Luke 17:20–21&lt;/a&gt;).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should be in our hearts, and, when it is in our individual hearts, it will also be in our great buildings of worship, in our lovely educational institutions, and in our magnificent temples, as well as in our homes and families.

But the &lt;i&gt;keys&lt;/i&gt; of the kingdom rest with the president of the Church. It is that authority that activates and governs all Church activities. Without priesthood keys and authority, there would be no church.

Paul’s prayer was that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/3.13-19?lang=eng#p12&quot;&gt;Ephesians 3:13–19&lt;/a&gt;). That is my prayer also. I feel like Peter when some of the early Saints had begun to fall away. The Savior was troubled and said to the Twelve, “Will ye also go away?”

Peter responded for the Twelve by remarking:

&lt;i&gt;Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.67-69?lang=eng#p66&quot;&gt;John 6:67–69&lt;/a&gt;]

Of that I testify in his sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Some time ago I was walking in the center of Salt Lake City on my way to City Creek Canyon. A car with an out-of-state license plate was driving by. The driver pulled over and asked, “Where is the church of the Mormons?” I assumed that he was thinking of some place or building. I took time to point out the tall Church Office Building, the stately Church Administration Building, the magnificent temple, and the historic tabernacle (the Conference Center had not yet been built). He thanked me and went on his way.</p>
<h2><b>Is It in Our Buildings?</b></h2>
<p>A few years ago my wife and I were in the temple in Kirtland, Ohio. It was late fall, and the afternoon sun was streaking through the old, wavy, handblown windowpanes. The building was light and airy and magnificent. Since some of my forebears were involved in its construction, I was humbled and honored to be under its roof. Within its walls and under its spell, I was enchanted by its beauty.</p>
<p>However, as President Boyd K. Packer correctly pointed out, “We do not have that building. When our people left, they took with them that which was important. They preserved the keys of the ordinances, the covenants, and the sealing power. They took with them all the essentials which we have today.”</p>
<p>So the Church cannot, in and of itself, be the temples, magnificent as they are, because the temple buildings alone do not bless. They are the exquisite containers for the pearls of great price administered therein by the priesthood of God.</p>
<p>Thanks to my wonderful wife, the Spirit of the Lord has often been in our various dwelling places. While we have lived within them, each has been a holy place for me. In our married life we have lived in single rooms with bathrooms down the hall and in small apartments. We have also owned three different houses. In a sense the Church has been in each, but I would not want to go back and live in our former homes, even though we spent much of our happy lives in them. The kingdom of God is not there.</p>
<h2><b>Is It in Our Families?</b></h2>
<p>Is the Church then in our families? We are getting close to the correct answer here. In a sense a family can foster the teachings of the Savior better than any other institution. In large measure the Church exists to strengthen families. I wish to define <i>family </i>very broadly. In the Church we have traditional families and single-parent families. Furthermore, each single member is considered to be, in a sense, a Church family. We also have ward families in which the bishop serves as a spiritual father.</p>
<p>Because of the erosion of family life and family values, we frequently hear urgent pleas requesting the Church as an organization to take over activities formerly considered family activities. I wonder if our maturing youth can hold everything together without family home evening, daily prayer, and daily scripture study. I say this because I am persuaded that family activities can be more effective in fostering the eternal values of love, loyalty, honesty, chastity, industry, self-worth, and personal integrity than any other institution.</p>
<p>Lou Holtz, the successful football coach from Notre Dame, stated:</p>
<p><i>The family is where our healthy values are formed and shaped. I know no greater challenge or more important role in life than in preparing our children to take their places as contributing citizens. We cannot relinquish this most important responsibility to gang leaders, drug leaders or even our own government. Nothing can destroy individuals or our country as quickly as drugs. It is not confined to a segment of our society, and it has created more damage than anything else I have witnessed in my lifetime. I have never heard a successful man or woman get up and say, “I owe my success to drugs and alcohol.” Yet I know thousands of people who have said publicly or in the press that they have ruined their lives because of drugs and alcohol. Suffice it to say, government can’t stop it, police can’t</i>, <i>but the family can.</i></p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the problem of drug and alcohol abuse, some may feel that it is an oversimplification to say that strong family leadership can solve the problem. Certainly not all families can, but I am persuaded that families with enough internal caring, discipline, commitment, and love somehow, someway, can handle the majority of their problems. However strong or weak the family may be, it can usually provide a better solution to most challenges than can any other institution in society or the government no matter how well intentioned it may be.</p>
<p>I believe that the principle reason that a caring family is the best antidote for drug and alcohol abuse and other problems is that unqualified love can flow from kinship relationships. Successful families usually have a strong, caring head. Ideally this would be a holder of the priesthood whose power and influence is maintained “by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41?lang=eng#p40">D&amp;C 121:41</a>).</p>
<p>Priesthood is desirable because whomsoever is blessed by this power, God will bless. But there have been many successful caring heads of families who are mothers, grandmothers, and others. What seems to distinguish a successful family is that the members of the family continue to care. They don’t give up. They never quit. They hang together through hardships and death and other problems.</p>
<p>I know of a close-knit family that is wonderfully successful in keeping everyone together. When the parents feel they are losing influence with teenagers, the help of cousins is enlisted to exert some counter peer pressure.</p>
<p>I would urge members of extended families—grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins—to reach out in concern, to succor. Mostly what is needed from grandparents, aunts, and uncles is unreserved love manifest as interest and concern. It builds confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth. Reproving and chastening adult family members should be rare indeed. We are told that it should happen only when a person is moved upon by the Holy Ghost. But I have been grateful for those in my family who have loved me enough to give me both the gentle and strong reproof on occasion as needed. We read in Proverbs: “He that refuseth reproof erreth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/10.17?lang=eng#p16">Proverbs 10:17</a>).</p>
<p>The fact that some members do not have functioning traditional families is no reason to move in a direction that would diminish or abandon family activities among those who can and should foster them. With the increased onslaught of forces that cause families to disintegrate, we ought to dig in our heels to preserve all that is great and good in the family. We are reminded that in times of tribulations, the Nephites were not fighting for a political cause such as monarchy or power; rather, they “were inspired by a better cause, . . . they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.45?lang=eng#p44">Alma 43:45</a>). Some may find it strong doctrine, but I quote again from Alma in the Book of Mormon: “And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.47?lang=eng#p46">Alma 43:47</a>).</p>
<p>As a corollary to defending the family, we have a duty to teach our family members that the commandments of God may not be broken without drawing a penalty.</p>
<p>President Stephen L Richards said: “I want this taught to youth so that they may comprehend it. It is their due and their right to have these things given to them without dilution or apology. This is justice and mercy. Neither shall rob the other.”</p>
<p>President Richards went on to state that it is no “kindness to any youth to whitewash [various sins such as] lying and deceit,” which are so prevalent today. “Perhaps the greatest of all [is] that robbery which steals virtue from either woman or man” (<i>CR, </i>April 1957, 99).</p>
<h2><b>Is It in Our Hearts?</b></h2>
<p>So the family is and must always be an important part of the Church. But the Lord’s kingdom ultimately must be found in our hearts before it can be anywhere else. Paul gave us a key when he said to the Romans: “He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.27?lang=eng#p26">Romans 8:27</a>). He also said, “The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.5?lang=eng#p4">Romans 5:5</a>).</p>
<p>In the story of David, who was called in his youth to be the future king of Israel, we learn how much the Lord judges by what is in the heart. We all remember how the Lord sent the prophet Samuel to the house of Jesse, saying, “For I have provided me a king among his sons” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.1?lang=eng#primary">1 Samuel 16:1</a>). One by one, Jesse had his seven oldest sons pass before Samuel. In considering each one, Samuel was instructed by the Lord to “look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7?lang=eng#p6">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). And so, as the seven sons passed before him, Samuel said to Jesse, “The Lord hath not chosen these.”</p>
<p><i>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</i></p>
<p><i>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</i></p>
<p><i>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.10-13?lang=eng#p9">1 Samuel 16:10–13</a>]</p>
<p>Like Daniel of old, what we do or do not do in life originates in our hearts. As Daniel stood in the court of Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon who captured Jerusalem, “Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.8?lang=eng#p7">Daniel 1:8</a>). From then on Daniel held to that purpose. It eventually brought him the highest of heavenly and earthly honors.</p>
<p>The greatness of Willard Richard’s heart was manifest just before the martyrdom of the Prophet:</p>
<p><i>Joseph said to Dr. Richards, “If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?” The doctor answered, “Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you—you did not ask me to come to Carthage—you did not ask me to come to jail with you—and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.” Joseph said, “You cannot.” The doctor replied, “I will.”</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:616]</p>
<p>Alma teaches us the necessity for having the good seed of faith planted in our hearts:</p>
<p><i>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your </i>heart,<i> behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p27">Alma 32:28</a>; emphasis added]</p>
<p>Revelation comes to us in our minds, but it also comes in our hearts. In a revelation to Oliver Cowdery in section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord says, “Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your <i>heart,</i> by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your <i>heart”</i> (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2?lang=eng#p1">D&amp;C 8:2</a>; emphasis added). To me it is very interesting that the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost is in our hearts.</p>
<p>What if the Lord appeared to each of us as He did to Solomon and said, “Ask what I shall give thee”? How would you answer? Would you ask for a new car? A new home? A blessing of health? A station in life? Solomon did not ask for anything like these. Neither did he ask for fame or for fortune. Rather, he responded: “Give therefore thy servant an understanding <i>heart.”</i> This reply pleased the Lord.</p>
<p><i>And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</i></p>
<p><i>Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding </i>heart;<i> so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</i></p>
<p><i>And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3.5,9,11-13?lang=eng#p4">1 Kings 3:5, 9, 11–13</a>; emphasis added]</p>
<p>There is some strong language in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants regarding who has claim upon our hearts: “I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.22?lang=eng#p21">D&amp;C 64:22</a>).</p>
<p>So when the inquirer in the car with the out-of-state license plate asked, “Where is the church of the Mormons?” I could have answered differently. I could have pointed to my chest and said that the Church should be first and foremost in our hearts. Then the traveler would surely have been somewhat bewildered. But that response would have been more accurate than my directing him to our beloved, magnificent, sky-piercing spires; the great majestic dome; and the other world-famous monuments and edifices—wonderful and unique and great as they are. It would have been more correct because the Lord said, “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.20-21?lang=eng#p19">Luke 17:20–21</a>).</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should be in our hearts, and, when it is in our individual hearts, it will also be in our great buildings of worship, in our lovely educational institutions, and in our magnificent temples, as well as in our homes and families.</p>
<p>But the <i>keys</i> of the kingdom rest with the president of the Church. It is that authority that activates and governs all Church activities. Without priesthood keys and authority, there would be no church.</p>
<p>Paul’s prayer was that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/3.13-19?lang=eng#p12">Ephesians 3:13–19</a>). That is my prayer also. I feel like Peter when some of the early Saints had begun to fall away. The Savior was troubled and said to the Twelve, “Will ye also go away?”</p>
<p>Peter responded for the Twelve by remarking:</p>
<p><i>Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</i></p>
<p><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.67-69?lang=eng#p66">John 6:67–69</a>]</p>
<p>Of that I testify in his sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you for your warm welcome, and thank you, President Samuelson, for your very kind introduction. As you point out, I am the Catholic Archbishop of Chicago and also the President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. This dual role allows me to bring greetings from both the Catholic community of Chicago and from the Catholic bishops of this country to all of you—students, faculty, staff, and administration of this distinguished university, now marking its 135th year of service in higher education, and also to our guests from the surrounding community, many of whom I’m told are watching on satellite TV.
As a cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, I have a special bond with the Bishop of Rome, Pope Benedict XVI, whose specific service is one of preserving unity among Catholic believers everywhere and also of fostering peace and respect for human life and dignity among all people of goodwill. As a cardinal priest, that is, as a member of the clergy of Rome itself, quite apart from my being Archbishop of Chicago, I have the privilege and obligation to vote in a papal election. The cardinals assemble at the death of one pope in order to elect his successor because they are the clergy of Rome; but the choice of the Bishop of Rome, the one who sits in the chair of St. Peter, is, for us Catholics, we pray and hope and believe, in the hands of God, our Heavenly Father. Most important of all, I am a bishop of the Catholic Church and, therefore, a pastor to the people whom Christ Jesus has given me to love and to care for, first of all in two counties of Illinois, Cook and Lake Counties, which count 2.3 million baptized Catholics in the Archdiocese of Chicago, but also with a shared concern for all the Churches. Catholic bishops collectively oversee the Catholic Church with and under the Successor of Saint Peter, the head of the Apostolic College, the Bishop of Rome.
So I come before you today as a religious leader who shares with you a love for our own country but also, like many, a growing concern about its moral health as a good society. In recent years Catholics and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have stood more frequently side by side in the public square to defend human life and dignity. In addition to working together to alleviate poverty here and abroad, we have been together in combating the degradations associated with the pornography industry; in promoting respect for the right to life of those still waiting in their mother’s womb to be born; and in defending marriage as the union of one man and one woman for the sake of family against various efforts to redefine in civil law that foundational element of God’s natural plan for creation. I am personally grateful that, after 180 years of living mostly apart from one another, Catholics and Latter-day Saints have begun to see one another as trustworthy partners in the defense of shared moral principles and in the promotion of th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The first half of the year 2002 has been exciting in the history of the Church. In President Gordon B. Hinckley’s pioneer commemoration address, given July 21 at the Conference Center, he said: “From my childhood I have had an appreciation for the pioneers. And that initial respect has been enhanced tremendously—far beyond my own expectations—by two recent events.”
President Hinckley went on to say that the two events this year were the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and the dedication of the Nauvoo Temple. He talked about the miracle that “has come to pass from that pioneer day to our own” (“What a Miracle! Pioneer Day in Light of Recent Events,” Church News, 27 July 2002, 3). I most heartily agree!
The Winter Olympics were wonderful. It was an exciting time to be in Salt Lake City. How we enjoyed mingling with the throngs of people from near and far, feeling the spirit of the Olympics. It was a time of great cooperation and unity in our city. Special care was taken to see that the Olympics did not become a “Mormon event.” Church leaders worked very carefully so that the public did not observe proselyting as they came to visit. Visitors were warmly received by friendly, helpful volunteers.
The scriptures have declared that the “gospel might be proclaimed . . . before kings and rulers” (D&amp;C 1:23). This surely occurred at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. “Kings and rulers” came from around the world asking for an audience with the First Presidency. The days were filled with such visits during the Olympic period. We had greater coverage from newspapers, television, radio, and the Internet than has ever been experienced before in the history of the Church.
We were exposed to the world. That exposure was almost completely positive. Many felt these were the best Olympic Games ever. Surveys taken following the Games showed a marked increase in public understanding of who we are and what we believe in. There was a remarkable increase in those who recognize us as Christians but different in our beliefs from the other Christian denominations.
The second event occurred in June with the dedication of the Nauvoo Temple. The sacrifice of the early Saints in building the Nauvoo Temple can never be forgotten. They were faithful in their tithes and participated in additional donation requests—which they gladly provided, though they were living in poverty. They also donated one day in 10 laboring to construct the beautiful building.
The Saints were driven from their beautiful homes in Nauvoo more than 150 years ago. After they left, the centerpiece of their beautiful city, the temple, was desecrated and burned to the ground. You can imagine their feelings as they crossed the Mississippi and took one long, last look at their beautiful city and the temple on the hill. Realizing they probably would not see it again, they turned their faces west to go into a desert wasteland </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">There is a scripture to which President Howard W. Hunter referred during the training of General Authorities at October conference 1992. I have written that statement in my scriptures in the margin. This is the scripture from Jeremiah 31:31–34:
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; . . .
But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
It is my conviction that most of you will live to see that day. How can the great Jehovah put His law in our inward parts and write it in our hearts? Why will there no longer be a need to teach our neighbors? Why will He forgive our iniquity?
A year ago this coming April, President Packer, who, along with the Twelve Apostles, is responsible for the training of all of the General and Area Authorities, gave us counsel and direction that will lead to the fulfillment of the quote from Jeremiah. The training was the deepest and most meaningful of any I have experienced in my 29 years as a General Authority. It changed my life and, I would assume, the lives of all the Brethren. President Packer is a divine seer. He took the necessary preparation time and made the total effort required by the Lord to receive the direction necessary from the Lord. He read the books on Christ by Frederic William Farrar, possibly the most accurate biblical scholar outside of the Church. It is he and his writings that Elder James E. Talmage quotes in Jesus the Christ. Elder Bruce R. McConkie referred to his works often. President Packer read The New Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, which I also picked up and read. The humiliation, suffering, and horror of the early Christians and the cruelty of the protesters is beyond our ability to comprehend. Most of the Christians were burned at the stake, had their flesh torn from them, were buried alive, or were put in dens with half-starved lions or tigers. These early Christians suffered the deepest, most penetrating pain possible, and almost to their dying breath called out to Jesus. It was as though they could already see Him. As I read stories of hundreds who suffered those horrific experiences, I wondered, and I hoped that if I were ever to be put in similar circumstances that I would suffer in the wonderful dignified way they did. I hope I </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I was listening to a Jerry Seinfeld CD recently, and in one of his sets he pointed out that he had recently read that speaking in front of a crowd is the number one fear of the average person. Number two was death. So, for the average person, that means that if you were at a funeral, you’d rather be in the casket than doing the eulogy. I thought it was funny when I heard it, but now that I have to give this talk, I actually believe it.
When the Savior was here on the earth, he made it clear to his disciples that his mortal ministry was with the house of Israel and not with other nations (Matthew 15:24). After his death and resurrection, however, he met with his disciples and expanded their mission as follows:
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. [Matthew 28:19–20]
However, it took them a while to grasp the full import of the Savior’s charge. Many of the original journeys of the apostles were to pockets of Jews living in Asia Minor. They were of the opinion that only the Jews should be allowed to accept the gospel. But a revelation to Peter recorded in Acts 10 changed all that. As you may recall, Cornelius, a centurion who was described as a good man, was told in a vision to find Peter and seek his advice on matters of the Spirit. The next day he sent his servants to Joppa, where Peter was staying. Meanwhile, Peter, who was hungry and waiting for a meal to be prepared, went to the housetop to pray. As he prayed, he had a vision in which he saw descending from the heavens a vessel that looked like a sheet knit at the four corners. Within the sheet were different foods that the Jews had been commanded by the Lord not to eat. But a voice came to Peter commanding him to eat the things in the sheet. Peter’s response was that he could not because he had never eaten anything that was common or unclean. The voice spoke to him a second time, saying, “What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common” (Acts 10:15).
When the vision ended, Peter had no idea what it meant, and this must have been frustrating. Dreams can be like that sometimes. As he was thinking about the vision and what it could have meant, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them” (Acts 10:19–20). So Peter met the three men and went with them to Caesarea the next day to meet with Cornelius. As Peter met Cornelius, he finally figured out what the vision meant. He said:
Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. [Acts 10:28]
Then, after meeting with Cornelius, learning of his desires, and feeling his sp</span>
