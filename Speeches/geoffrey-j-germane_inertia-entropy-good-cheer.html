  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Brothers and sisters, though I consider it a great privilege to speak to you today, perhaps I have never been so much aware of my personal inadequacy to deliver something of value to you without the help of the Lord. I only hope that together we can accomplish the purposes of a devotional assembly at BYU. To borrow a scriptural reference from my friend Andrew Skinner, which sums up my feelings since being asked a few weeks ago to participate, the prophet Ezra said, “And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished” (Ezra 9:3). I seek your silent and sincere prayers that in spite of my astonishment, and perhaps yours, we may communicate by the Spirit.

After some struggle, and knowing somewhat of the anxiety and fears that accompany the convergence of crucial decisions in young lives, I have felt I should focus on aspects of our inherent ability to feel the Spirit and to be comforted and guided and encouraged. My wife and I met in a BYU ward a few years ago. When we contemplated our future family, we thought about naming our first three daughters Faith, Hope, and Charity. Instead, we named them Inertia, Entropy, and Good Cheer. They have since asked to have their names changed. Actually, we have five sons and only two daughters, named Megan and Rosalie. But I would like to relate the focus of my remarks to inertia, entropy, and good cheer.

The gospel encompasses all truth. Even if you have math phobia or science anxiety, I think that we can have some fun discussing two physical properties, inertia and entropy. Inertia and entropy are properties of matter that have some analogous meaning in our lives on this earth. All of us daily experience the effects or the influence of these properties. Let me describe how these properties relate to us and how I think we can best respond to their effects on us. The responses to each of the two become the basis for two keys in developing and maintaining what the Lord calls “good cheer.” The operation of these keys leads to a third key reason for us to “be of good cheer.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inertia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Inertia is that tendency of matter, if at rest, to remain at rest, or, if moving, to continue moving in the same direction unless acted upon by some external force. Thus, when young David pitted his sling against the Philistine giant, the armored Goliath of Gath, we can identify the effects of inertia in this interesting episode. David propelled a smooth stone toward the great Goliath by using a sling. The inertia of the small high-velocity stone created a force that embedded the stone in Goliath’s forehead. I like President Hugh B. Brown’s characterization of the result: “Nothing like that had ever entered his head before” (&lt;i&gt;The Abundant Life &lt;/i&gt;[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], p. 342). The inertia of Goliath’s large head and body limited the response to just enough movement to push him off balance, and he fell.

Some of you may remember an outstanding football play that helped preserve BYU’s undefeated record during the 1984 national championship season. Hawaii was at the goal line very late in the game. BYU led by less than a touchdown. If Hawaii were to score a touchdown, BYU probably would lose the game. Anticipating the snap count perfectly, Kyle Morrell leaped over both the defensive and offensive lines and landed on the Hawaii quarterback for a loss of yards. BYU held and hung on to win the game. To what do we attribute the success of the play? Well, to good timing and, yes, inertia.

Any mass, whether stationary or moving, possesses inertia. It is good to be steadfast and immovable if it is a matter of correct principle; it is good to be moving along the path if the metaphor relates our life’s journey to the straight and narrow way. If our inertia prevents us from making a course correction, it may mean that we are stubborn. If we possess inertia that keeps us moving and carries us past temptation, it may mean that we have developed constructive habits and discipline. In any case, a force or effort is required for us to start moving if we are stalled or stagnant, or to change directions if we have strayed from the right path, or to continue moving ahead in the right way against the resistance referred to by Lehi when he said, “It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11). The process of dealing with our inertia often involves overcoming weaknesses, which the Lord indicated are customized resistances that he will assist us to overcome (see Ether 12:27). Inertia can be our enemy or our friend.

The people of Nephi lived for nearly 200 years in peace and harmony following the several days’ visit of the resurrected Savior. You might say they were provided with significant inertia as they were propelled toward a Zion society by the profound teachings and ministering of Jesus Christ. Twelve disciples were ordained to help regulate and direct the affairs of the new church. As the people listened to the twelve, they preserved peace and prosperity. In time, against the obstacles and resistances of life, they stopped listening and lost their way. The proper movement of that marvelous society, caused by the initial and continuing inertia provided by the Lord and his disciples, was ultimately overcome by the external forces of pride and selfishness.

What can we do to take the best advantage of the property of inertia in our lives? Because our spiritual movement is affected by our inertia, it is important to continue moving, and in the right direction. I would suggest that we learn from the ancient Nephite Zion that the best way to ensure that we make inertia our friend is simply to follow the Brethren. Following with high fidelity the latter-day prophets, seers, and revelators will assure our continuous movement along proper paths at appropriate velocities (see D&amp;amp;C 1:38, 6:9, 21:5, 52:9, 58:18, 84:36).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entropy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Several interesting concepts can be described with the relatively recently discovered property of entropy and related ideas. The general statement of the principle of increase in entropy may be stated: “Every system left to itself will, on the average, change toward a condition of maximum probability; or, every system left to itself will, on the average, change toward a condition of maximum disorder.” Thus, faculty offices tend toward the disorganized; perhaps some college students’ apartments tend toward the unbelievable; and most certainly my kids’ bedrooms tend toward chaos. The mystery of missing socks that produce countless wardrobe dilemmas is partially explained, I think, by this principle.

The trend in nature from order to disorder has been reversed only once in recorded history:

&lt;i&gt;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. &lt;/i&gt;[Genesis 1:1–3]

Order was created from chaos. The energy potential available to man on the earth was like some giant watch spring wound tight. After Father Adam and Mother Eve were expelled from the garden, the principle of increase in entropy has been in operation ever since—the watch spring has been gradually unwinding through history. Entropy is a measure of how rapidly the watch spring unwinds.

This principle applies to all of us all of the time. We are all familiar with the corollary “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” However, we deliberately work to decrease entropy in our environment. For example, criminal and civil laws are commands to decrease rather than increase entropy (thou shalt not kill, arson, etc.). (It is interesting to contemplate that if the entropy of crimes against society could be quantified, the severity of punishment could be in proportion to the entropy increase for that action.) The Lord counseled, “Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish . . . a house of order” (D&amp;amp;C 88:119). However, it would not be consistent with our knowledge of the plan of salvation to continually decrease entropy locally. Going too far could result in behavior that is rigidly specified—the individual must have freedom to obey or reject as one sees fit. Our agency is inextricably related to the operation of the principle of increase in entropy. In this analogy, sin tends to increase entropy. The application of intelligence can reduce entropy locally, but there is always an accompanying larger increase in the entropy of our “universe.” Therefore, all processes in which we engage are irreversible. That is, we cannot return to where we were without some permanent change in our surroundings, except for one crucial and highly significant exception. Let me illustrate.

When a pot of water is placed on the stove to boil, the water undergoes a process. First it heats up. The temperature increases to the boiling temperature, then the water continues to receive heat from the burner at the boiling temperature until it changes from liquid to vapor. The vapor then escapes to the surroundings. In the process of boiling, the water follows a prescribed path, which is a series of very small changes from one state to the next. It follows the same path every time. If one were to ascribe the characteristic of agency to the water, it might even be said that the water is perfectly obedient in precisely following the path as it successfully undergoes the process of boiling. It responds without error to the external influence of heat transferred to it through the pot.

The process of boiling water is an irreversible process since it is impossible for the water vapor to return to liquid water with no change in the surroundings. When steam condenses to form liquid water, the heat released by the steam goes into the surroundings at a low temperature rather than back into the burner on the stove at a high temperature. The ideal is a reversible process, where the effects of a process can be reversed without any change to the surroundings and there is no net increase in entropy. Such processes do not exist in our world. However, based on the principles that I have been talking about, there is an exception that produces a reversible process in the lives of Heavenly Father’s children that I will describe now.

Unlike water brought to boil, which without deviation follows the prescribed path, we could, in our progression, stray from the narrow way because of the inertia of our own weakness or ignorance. Should this happen, we can experience a miraculous reversal of our actions without any eternal effect as we continue the process of growth and change. The Lord has provided, through his atonement on conditions of repentance, for the only known reversible process—that of forgiveness for sins. If we truly repent, then we can return to the straight way through a change in our heart. We, as Paul said, “Put off . . . the old” and “put on the new” (see Ephesians 4:22–24). Such a process is reversible in the sense that the Lord, representing our secure surroundings, says of those who repent of their sins, “The same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).

That repentance is the best way to respond to the principle of increase of entropy in our lives is probably obvious. As we are invited to come unto Christ, we are given a specific path to take in a lifelong process. It is a process of growth that will result, ultimately, in perfection. Jesus said, “Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life” (3 Nephi 14:14). Repentance and forgiveness—this is a participatory process, and one of the participants has a perfect memory. He can choose what to remember and what to discard. Through repentance we can actually undergo a reversible process—something that is only a concept in the minds of men pertaining to physical processes. When we utilize our inertia to move toward Christ, to come unto Christ, we “put on the new,” and our old selves, and our old ways, become obsolete to, and forgotten by, the Lord.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good Cheer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In our lives we use idiomatic or pet phrases in a variety of situations that enable us to communicate enormous amounts of information in an economical way. In a sort of leverage of language, phrases like “hang in there,” “lighten up” or “go for it” connote meaning far beyond the few words expressed. The scriptures also contain such phrases—for example, “endure to the end,” “verily, verily, I say unto you,” and “it came to pass.” One phrase, however, which seems to be particularly useful to the Lord and from which we might gain some insight into the Lord’s personality, is the frequently used counsel “Be of good cheer.” The scriptures record the Lord speaking these words in a wide variety of situations to encourage, to comfort, to lift, to inspire, to convey compassion, to build hope, to validate faith, and to teach perspective. It lifts my spirit to imagine those various situations.

My wife has heard me talk about this so often during the past couple of weeks that the other night she lost it. She asked me, “What do you call a herd of smiling cows?” Begging the answer, she said, “Beef of good cheer.”

Once three good friends went into a malt shop across from a train station while they waited for the train. Ordering their favorite shakes, they continued an animated and enthusiastic visit. Before long they noticed that the train was pulling away from the station. In a panic they leaped from the table and all began to chase the accelerating train down the tracks. With a goal in mind, the first man reached the caboose and grabbed the rail. Turning and stretching, he grabbed the next fastest friend. With excitement and urgency they both formed a human chain to try to reach their friend with the shortest legs, who was sprinting with all his might to catch up with the train that by now had picked up serious speed. One last lunge just missed their outstretched reach, and he fell in a heap on the tracks as the train and his friends disappeared from view. The station attendant who witnessed the entire sequence from the station platform approached and was surprised to find the short-legged man sitting between the rails, shaking with laughter. When asked what was so funny about missing the train and being separated from the two other men, he replied, “They came down to see me off.” One lesson from this story is that enthusiasm is contagious. So, I think, is good cheer.

The good cheer so often spoken of by the Lord probably refers to an attitude—a mixture of faith, hope, and charity, and most certainly a state or condition that is part of the process of coming unto Christ. It is not naive optimism or superficial cheeriness but true good cheer born of faith, or belief, or even a desire to believe. The ability to be of good cheer, in the Lord’s sense, is perfection—independent; that is, it is not a state reserved only for prophets and babies. It is also situation independent; that is, whether we characterize our lives at the moment as “smooth sailing” or as being in “choppy seas” or trying to navigate the “Bermuda Triangle,” we can be of good cheer. Being of good cheer means never losing hope.

The apostle John said, “We love him, because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). Might that be safely extrapolated to “We come unto him because he first came unto us”?

Nephi, the great-great-grand son of Alma the Younger, cried mightily unto the Lord for the people who believed Samuel the Lamanite’s prophecies that Christ would come in five years. They “did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day” that would mark the first coming of Christ. The record states, “There was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet” (3 Nephi 1:8–9). Amazingly, the unbelievers, ignorant and impatient, ignored the increasingly frequent signs and miracles wrought among the people and apparently calendared “destruction day” on a date that was already taken—that day prophesied by Samuel nearly five years before. Nephi, with his heart exceedingly sorrowful, with the first “great and dreadful” day of the Lord at hand, after a full day of intense supplication, heard the voice of the Lord come unto him, “Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, . . . on the morrow come I into the world. . . . Behold, I come unto my own” (3 Nephi 1:13–14).

This, I think, is the third great key, or reason, for us to be of good cheer. The Lord has come unto us! He invites us to come unto him. In so doing, he does not distance himself but maintains a close proximity. He is ever watchful and knowing, encouraging and kind. Consider some other scriptural samples of the Lord’s sweet support.

During his second Galilean ministry, when Jesus came into Capernaum on the shore of Galilee after some time away, many gathered to hear him preach. Four men came carrying a paralytic, and, when they could not gain access to Jesus through the large crowd, with a resourcefulness born of faith and hope, they climbed up and lowered the sick man through the roof above Jesus. Christ saw their faith and said unto the sick of the palsy, “Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. . . . Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house” (see Matthew 9:2–6 and Mark 2:1–11).

In the same phase of his ministry, after the disciples participated with Jesus in the miraculous feeding of more than five thousand, Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him to the west side of the Sea of Galilee. Like us, they were on his errand. Like us sometimes, geographically they didn’t have very far to go. Left to their own strength against the contrary winds, they toiled against the sea for several hours attempting to cover the few miles to their destination. Exhausted from the struggle at their oars, they were almost certainly also deeply discouraged and frightened as the ship stalled against the waves in the midst of the sea. Jesus came unto them while they were doing what he asked, walking on the water as he approached the troubled ship. Sensing their fear, Jesus calmed them by saying, “Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid” (Matthew 14:27).

I have been especially touched by his patience with Peter when he bid him to come unto him upon the water. When Peter was focused on Christ, he actually defied a little gravity. Distracted by the swirling storm, he began to sink and became desperate for help. I wonder if the experience of being lifted by grasping the Lord’s outstretched hand was so deeply impressed upon his mind and soul that it prompted the great faith necessary during his own ministry, several years later, to lift the lame man by the hand at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, when he, fastening his eyes upon him, said, “Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk” (Acts 3:6).

In Jerusalem, during the last week of his mortal life, at the tender and intense occasion of the Last Supper, Jesus very plainly reminded his disciples of his impending death and resurrection. They would soon be without his personal companionship and would be scattered, but he would send to them the Holy Ghost. With compassion he comforted and consoled their troubled hearts:

&lt;i&gt;The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&lt;/i&gt;[John 16:27, 33]

President Benson has said:

&lt;i&gt;Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar His face is to us. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;God loves us, he’s watching us, he wants us to succeed. &lt;/i&gt;[Ezra Taft Benson, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/ezra-taft-benson_jesus-christ-gifts-expectations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;J&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;esus Christ—Gifts and Expectations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;i&gt;Speeches of the Year, 1974 &lt;/i&gt;(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), p. 313; also, Christmas Devotional, Salt Lake City, Utah, 7 December 1986]

Whether in illness, or feeling uncertainty for the future or fear or deep concern for our families or others, the Lord listens and knows and responds—the Lord is generous with his spirit.

I know this much better in retrospect. When I was a boy my mother and father were disenchanted with the traditional religion of their ancestors. Our family attended a church that was doctrinally unstructured and open. After my father died my mother stuck with it for a few more years, long enough for me to graduate from sixth-grade Sunday School. Though I participated in no organized religion from then on, I remember several occasions feeling quite confident that “things would work out” with no apparent basis for my inner assurance. I felt guided where to attend school and what major to pursue. That choice led to other momentous ones. I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints near the end of my first year of graduate school in Indiana. My master’s thesis advisor baptized me. I first became acquainted with him in a freshman chemistry laboratory, where I was excited to learn that he was involved in auto racing. We became fast friends, and his family became my family away from home. Little did I know that they were expert examples of President McKay’s description “every member a missionary.”

We started a racing club at the school, and I helped build various racing cars with this man. During my undergraduate years we drove long distances to professional drag races around the country, where he worked as an official and I helped on the crew. Interspersed with discussions during those many hours about racing, cars, and horsepower, I was introduced to his intriguing philosophy of who we were, where we came from, and where we were going. Did I want to know more? Absolutely! The plan of salvation “rang true,” and I began to appreciate the source of the good cheer I had felt growing up. Our conversations evolved to lengthy gospel discussions that gave me much to think about. The missionaries were somewhat taken aback when I answered “the LDS Church” to their question “Mr. Brown, what church do you know most about?” It was obviously a big decision to join the Church, but no bigger to me then than are some of the key decisions facing you now. I think the ability to be, in some small way, of good cheer helped me to think more clearly and to use my agency without error.

Before I was baptized I had decided to pursue a doctoral degree in mechanical engineering. One of my professors had just completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and told me of exciting work in my area of interest. I applied and was accepted to begin a Ph.D. program at Stanford the next fall. After my baptism I was interviewed by my bishop on several occasions. During one visit we talked about my plans. As I remember, I didn’t hesitate to change them when he counseled me to attend BYU, where I could meet my wife. So I did change my plans, and I did meet my wife. I’ve gained great comfort from my personal knowledge that the Lord has prompted and continues to prompt leaders and friends to influence my life at crucial and important times.

I bear testimony that the Lord knows each of you. We are numbered and nourished to keep us in the right way (see Moroni 6:4). This has been evidenced to me again and again in my teaching experience at BYU. In religion classes that I have had the privilege of teaching from time to time, I have usually given a series of assignments called “achievements.” Depending on the particular achievement, students are required to teach a gospel principle to someone else or to improve their private religious lives in some way and then to write an account of their experience and what they learned. One achievement was based on Alma 32 and involved not procrastinating acting on a prompting. In pondering the assignment, one student was prompted to visit a friend she hadn’t seen in almost a year. She was tempted to ignore the prompting but decided to not procrastinate acting upon it. When she went to her friend’s house, she found her alone in a seriously ill and deteriorating condition. Emergency hospitalization was necessary, which led to the recovery of the friend. The Lord himself said, “For behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered” (3 Nephi 18:31).

A recent visit with one of our stake patriarchs gave me another reminder. His testimony from giving many patriarchal blessings to young people in our stake is that the Lord’s love for the youth is overwhelming. That we each can obtain the Lord’s mind and will in the form of personal scripture at the hands of an ordained patriarch is a tremendous manifestation of his love for us. I can imagine the Lord impressing the words &lt;i&gt;be of good cheer &lt;/i&gt;onto your mind as you read and ponder your patriarchal blessing.

Though my daughter attends BYU, I am not so ancient that I cannot remember the kinds of struggles and hopes that you have as college students. It is dangerous to compare ourselves with others, but perhaps we are safe in considering one of the featured creatures in Dr. Seuss’ profound book &lt;i&gt;Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When I was quite young&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and quite small for my size,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I met an old man in the Desert of Drize. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And he sang me a song I will never forget. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;At least, well, I haven’t forgotten it yet.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He sat in a terribly prickly place.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But he sang with a sunny sweet smile on his face:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When you think things are bad,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;when you feel sour and blue,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;when you start to get mad . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you should do what &lt;/i&gt;I &lt;i&gt;do!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Just tell yourself, Duckie, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you’re really quite lucky!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Some people are much more . . . &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;oh, ever so much more . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;oh, muchly much-much more &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;unlucky than you! . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . consider the Schlottz,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the Crumple-horn, Web-footed, Green-bearded Schlottz,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;whose tail is entailed with un-solvable knots.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If &lt;/i&gt;he &lt;i&gt;isn’t muchly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;more worse off than you,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I’ll eat my umbrella.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That’s just what I’ll do.&lt;/i&gt;
[Dr. Seuss, &lt;i&gt;Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are? &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Random House, 1973), pp. 3–5, 20]

Brothers and sisters, the Lord’s exhortation to be of good cheer is an invitation to come unto Christ. It comes without an expiration date—it is always open. You have important decisions to make and pressures from all sides. I hope that on this campus you feel encouragement and support from the faculty and leaders. My experience with my colleagues is that you are loved and respected. If I may speak for them, we are concerned for your welfare and happiness. We understand something of your challenges. We are grateful for your faithfulness and consider it a privilege to work with you.

While the inflationary economics of entropy create disorder and confusion, the reversibility of sin begs us to apply the atonement of Christ through repentance to continually move toward the Savior. We are reminded weekly to “always remember him” that we “may always have his Spirit” to be with us (D&amp;amp;C 20:77). Might it be that we remember him because he first remembers us? Though he can forget our sins, he will always remember us, for he said: “Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.” And, in reference to our God-given ability to obtain forgiveness for our sins and thereby undergo a reversible process, he said, “Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me” (1 Nephi 21:15–16).

The Lord’s exhortation to be of good cheer apparently created a spiritual momentum among his apostles that persisted through many experiences. It seems from the scriptural record that he repeated the admonition only at times that were especially trying or intense. Whether we need a mid course adjustment or a boost to keep moving, the inertial force of the following admonition to a small band of Saints during a dangerous journey down the Missouri river is powerful:

&lt;i&gt;What I say unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me, the blessings of the kingdom are yours. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 61:36–37]

In the words of President Ezra Taft Benson:

&lt;i&gt;He is the same loving, compassionate Lord today as when He walked the dusty roads of Palestine. He is close to His servants on this earth. He cares about and loves each of us today. Of that you can be assured.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He lives today as our Lord, our Master, our Savior, our Redeemer, and our God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;God bless us all to believe in Him, to accept Him, to worship Him, and to fully trust in Him. &lt;/i&gt;[“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/11/jesus-christ-our-savior-and-redeemer?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;Jesus Christ: Our Savior and Redeemer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;November 1983, p. 8]

In the words of our dear prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley:

&lt;i&gt;We have nothing to fear. God is at the helm. He will overrule for the good of this work. He will shower down blessings upon those who walk in obedience to His commandments. Such has been His promise. Of His ability to keep that promise none of us can doubt. &lt;/i&gt;[“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/05/this-is-the-work-of-the-master?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;This Is the Work of the Master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;i&gt;Ensign, &lt;/i&gt;May 1995, p.69]

I know the things that I have said today are true. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Brothers and sisters, though I consider it a great privilege to speak to you today, perhaps I have never been so much aware of my personal inadequacy to deliver something of value to you without the help of the Lord. I only hope that together we can accomplish the purposes of a devotional assembly at BYU. To borrow a scriptural reference from my friend Andrew Skinner, which sums up my feelings since being asked a few weeks ago to participate, the prophet Ezra said, “And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished” (Ezra 9:3). I seek your silent and sincere prayers that in spite of my astonishment, and perhaps yours, we may communicate by the Spirit.</p>
<p>After some struggle, and knowing somewhat of the anxiety and fears that accompany the convergence of crucial decisions in young lives, I have felt I should focus on aspects of our inherent ability to feel the Spirit and to be comforted and guided and encouraged. My wife and I met in a BYU ward a few years ago. When we contemplated our future family, we thought about naming our first three daughters Faith, Hope, and Charity. Instead, we named them Inertia, Entropy, and Good Cheer. They have since asked to have their names changed. Actually, we have five sons and only two daughters, named Megan and Rosalie. But I would like to relate the focus of my remarks to inertia, entropy, and good cheer.</p>
<p>The gospel encompasses all truth. Even if you have math phobia or science anxiety, I think that we can have some fun discussing two physical properties, inertia and entropy. Inertia and entropy are properties of matter that have some analogous meaning in our lives on this earth. All of us daily experience the effects or the influence of these properties. Let me describe how these properties relate to us and how I think we can best respond to their effects on us. The responses to each of the two become the basis for two keys in developing and maintaining what the Lord calls “good cheer.” The operation of these keys leads to a third key reason for us to “be of good cheer.”</p>
<h2><b>Inertia</b></h2>
<p>Inertia is that tendency of matter, if at rest, to remain at rest, or, if moving, to continue moving in the same direction unless acted upon by some external force. Thus, when young David pitted his sling against the Philistine giant, the armored Goliath of Gath, we can identify the effects of inertia in this interesting episode. David propelled a smooth stone toward the great Goliath by using a sling. The inertia of the small high-velocity stone created a force that embedded the stone in Goliath’s forehead. I like President Hugh B. Brown’s characterization of the result: “Nothing like that had ever entered his head before” (<i>The Abundant Life </i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], p. 342). The inertia of Goliath’s large head and body limited the response to just enough movement to push him off balance, and he fell.</p>
<p>Some of you may remember an outstanding football play that helped preserve BYU’s undefeated record during the 1984 national championship season. Hawaii was at the goal line very late in the game. BYU led by less than a touchdown. If Hawaii were to score a touchdown, BYU probably would lose the game. Anticipating the snap count perfectly, Kyle Morrell leaped over both the defensive and offensive lines and landed on the Hawaii quarterback for a loss of yards. BYU held and hung on to win the game. To what do we attribute the success of the play? Well, to good timing and, yes, inertia.</p>
<p>Any mass, whether stationary or moving, possesses inertia. It is good to be steadfast and immovable if it is a matter of correct principle; it is good to be moving along the path if the metaphor relates our life’s journey to the straight and narrow way. If our inertia prevents us from making a course correction, it may mean that we are stubborn. If we possess inertia that keeps us moving and carries us past temptation, it may mean that we have developed constructive habits and discipline. In any case, a force or effort is required for us to start moving if we are stalled or stagnant, or to change directions if we have strayed from the right path, or to continue moving ahead in the right way against the resistance referred to by Lehi when he said, “It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things” (2 Nephi 2:11). The process of dealing with our inertia often involves overcoming weaknesses, which the Lord indicated are customized resistances that he will assist us to overcome (see Ether 12:27). Inertia can be our enemy or our friend.</p>
<p>The people of Nephi lived for nearly 200 years in peace and harmony following the several days’ visit of the resurrected Savior. You might say they were provided with significant inertia as they were propelled toward a Zion society by the profound teachings and ministering of Jesus Christ. Twelve disciples were ordained to help regulate and direct the affairs of the new church. As the people listened to the twelve, they preserved peace and prosperity. In time, against the obstacles and resistances of life, they stopped listening and lost their way. The proper movement of that marvelous society, caused by the initial and continuing inertia provided by the Lord and his disciples, was ultimately overcome by the external forces of pride and selfishness.</p>
<p>What can we do to take the best advantage of the property of inertia in our lives? Because our spiritual movement is affected by our inertia, it is important to continue moving, and in the right direction. I would suggest that we learn from the ancient Nephite Zion that the best way to ensure that we make inertia our friend is simply to follow the Brethren. Following with high fidelity the latter-day prophets, seers, and revelators will assure our continuous movement along proper paths at appropriate velocities (see D&amp;C 1:38, 6:9, 21:5, 52:9, 58:18, 84:36).</p>
<h2><b>Entropy</b></h2>
<p>Several interesting concepts can be described with the relatively recently discovered property of entropy and related ideas. The general statement of the principle of increase in entropy may be stated: “Every system left to itself will, on the average, change toward a condition of maximum probability; or, every system left to itself will, on the average, change toward a condition of maximum disorder.” Thus, faculty offices tend toward the disorganized; perhaps some college students’ apartments tend toward the unbelievable; and most certainly my kids’ bedrooms tend toward chaos. The mystery of missing socks that produce countless wardrobe dilemmas is partially explained, I think, by this principle.</p>
<p>The trend in nature from order to disorder has been reversed only once in recorded history:</p>
<p><i>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</i></p>
<p><i>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</i></p>
<p><i>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. </i>[Genesis 1:1–3]</p>
<p>Order was created from chaos. The energy potential available to man on the earth was like some giant watch spring wound tight. After Father Adam and Mother Eve were expelled from the garden, the principle of increase in entropy has been in operation ever since—the watch spring has been gradually unwinding through history. Entropy is a measure of how rapidly the watch spring unwinds.</p>
<p>This principle applies to all of us all of the time. We are all familiar with the corollary “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” However, we deliberately work to decrease entropy in our environment. For example, criminal and civil laws are commands to decrease rather than increase entropy (thou shalt not kill, arson, etc.). (It is interesting to contemplate that if the entropy of crimes against society could be quantified, the severity of punishment could be in proportion to the entropy increase for that action.) The Lord counseled, “Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish . . . a house of order” (D&amp;C 88:119). However, it would not be consistent with our knowledge of the plan of salvation to continually decrease entropy locally. Going too far could result in behavior that is rigidly specified—the individual must have freedom to obey or reject as one sees fit. Our agency is inextricably related to the operation of the principle of increase in entropy. In this analogy, sin tends to increase entropy. The application of intelligence can reduce entropy locally, but there is always an accompanying larger increase in the entropy of our “universe.” Therefore, all processes in which we engage are irreversible. That is, we cannot return to where we were without some permanent change in our surroundings, except for one crucial and highly significant exception. Let me illustrate.</p>
<p>When a pot of water is placed on the stove to boil, the water undergoes a process. First it heats up. The temperature increases to the boiling temperature, then the water continues to receive heat from the burner at the boiling temperature until it changes from liquid to vapor. The vapor then escapes to the surroundings. In the process of boiling, the water follows a prescribed path, which is a series of very small changes from one state to the next. It follows the same path every time. If one were to ascribe the characteristic of agency to the water, it might even be said that the water is perfectly obedient in precisely following the path as it successfully undergoes the process of boiling. It responds without error to the external influence of heat transferred to it through the pot.</p>
<p>The process of boiling water is an irreversible process since it is impossible for the water vapor to return to liquid water with no change in the surroundings. When steam condenses to form liquid water, the heat released by the steam goes into the surroundings at a low temperature rather than back into the burner on the stove at a high temperature. The ideal is a reversible process, where the effects of a process can be reversed without any change to the surroundings and there is no net increase in entropy. Such processes do not exist in our world. However, based on the principles that I have been talking about, there is an exception that produces a reversible process in the lives of Heavenly Father’s children that I will describe now.</p>
<p>Unlike water brought to boil, which without deviation follows the prescribed path, we could, in our progression, stray from the narrow way because of the inertia of our own weakness or ignorance. Should this happen, we can experience a miraculous reversal of our actions without any eternal effect as we continue the process of growth and change. The Lord has provided, through his atonement on conditions of repentance, for the only known reversible process—that of forgiveness for sins. If we truly repent, then we can return to the straight way through a change in our heart. We, as Paul said, “Put off . . . the old” and “put on the new” (see Ephesians 4:22–24). Such a process is reversible in the sense that the Lord, representing our secure surroundings, says of those who repent of their sins, “The same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (D&amp;C 58:42).</p>
<p>That repentance is the best way to respond to the principle of increase of entropy in our lives is probably obvious. As we are invited to come unto Christ, we are given a specific path to take in a lifelong process. It is a process of growth that will result, ultimately, in perfection. Jesus said, “Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life” (3 Nephi 14:14). Repentance and forgiveness—this is a participatory process, and one of the participants has a perfect memory. He can choose what to remember and what to discard. Through repentance we can actually undergo a reversible process—something that is only a concept in the minds of men pertaining to physical processes. When we utilize our inertia to move toward Christ, to come unto Christ, we “put on the new,” and our old selves, and our old ways, become obsolete to, and forgotten by, the Lord.</p>
<h2><b>Good Cheer</b></h2>
<p>In our lives we use idiomatic or pet phrases in a variety of situations that enable us to communicate enormous amounts of information in an economical way. In a sort of leverage of language, phrases like “hang in there,” “lighten up” or “go for it” connote meaning far beyond the few words expressed. The scriptures also contain such phrases—for example, “endure to the end,” “verily, verily, I say unto you,” and “it came to pass.” One phrase, however, which seems to be particularly useful to the Lord and from which we might gain some insight into the Lord’s personality, is the frequently used counsel “Be of good cheer.” The scriptures record the Lord speaking these words in a wide variety of situations to encourage, to comfort, to lift, to inspire, to convey compassion, to build hope, to validate faith, and to teach perspective. It lifts my spirit to imagine those various situations.</p>
<p>My wife has heard me talk about this so often during the past couple of weeks that the other night she lost it. She asked me, “What do you call a herd of smiling cows?” Begging the answer, she said, “Beef of good cheer.”</p>
<p>Once three good friends went into a malt shop across from a train station while they waited for the train. Ordering their favorite shakes, they continued an animated and enthusiastic visit. Before long they noticed that the train was pulling away from the station. In a panic they leaped from the table and all began to chase the accelerating train down the tracks. With a goal in mind, the first man reached the caboose and grabbed the rail. Turning and stretching, he grabbed the next fastest friend. With excitement and urgency they both formed a human chain to try to reach their friend with the shortest legs, who was sprinting with all his might to catch up with the train that by now had picked up serious speed. One last lunge just missed their outstretched reach, and he fell in a heap on the tracks as the train and his friends disappeared from view. The station attendant who witnessed the entire sequence from the station platform approached and was surprised to find the short-legged man sitting between the rails, shaking with laughter. When asked what was so funny about missing the train and being separated from the two other men, he replied, “They came down to see me off.” One lesson from this story is that enthusiasm is contagious. So, I think, is good cheer.</p>
<p>The good cheer so often spoken of by the Lord probably refers to an attitude—a mixture of faith, hope, and charity, and most certainly a state or condition that is part of the process of coming unto Christ. It is not naive optimism or superficial cheeriness but true good cheer born of faith, or belief, or even a desire to believe. The ability to be of good cheer, in the Lord’s sense, is perfection—independent; that is, it is not a state reserved only for prophets and babies. It is also situation independent; that is, whether we characterize our lives at the moment as “smooth sailing” or as being in “choppy seas” or trying to navigate the “Bermuda Triangle,” we can be of good cheer. Being of good cheer means never losing hope.</p>
<p>The apostle John said, “We love him, because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). Might that be safely extrapolated to “We come unto him because he first came unto us”?</p>
<p>Nephi, the great-great-grand son of Alma the Younger, cried mightily unto the Lord for the people who believed Samuel the Lamanite’s prophecies that Christ would come in five years. They “did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day” that would mark the first coming of Christ. The record states, “There was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet” (3 Nephi 1:8–9). Amazingly, the unbelievers, ignorant and impatient, ignored the increasingly frequent signs and miracles wrought among the people and apparently calendared “destruction day” on a date that was already taken—that day prophesied by Samuel nearly five years before. Nephi, with his heart exceedingly sorrowful, with the first “great and dreadful” day of the Lord at hand, after a full day of intense supplication, heard the voice of the Lord come unto him, “Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, . . . on the morrow come I into the world. . . . Behold, I come unto my own” (3 Nephi 1:13–14).</p>
<p>This, I think, is the third great key, or reason, for us to be of good cheer. The Lord has come unto us! He invites us to come unto him. In so doing, he does not distance himself but maintains a close proximity. He is ever watchful and knowing, encouraging and kind. Consider some other scriptural samples of the Lord’s sweet support.</p>
<p>During his second Galilean ministry, when Jesus came into Capernaum on the shore of Galilee after some time away, many gathered to hear him preach. Four men came carrying a paralytic, and, when they could not gain access to Jesus through the large crowd, with a resourcefulness born of faith and hope, they climbed up and lowered the sick man through the roof above Jesus. Christ saw their faith and said unto the sick of the palsy, “Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. . . . Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house” (see Matthew 9:2–6 and Mark 2:1–11).</p>
<p>In the same phase of his ministry, after the disciples participated with Jesus in the miraculous feeding of more than five thousand, Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him to the west side of the Sea of Galilee. Like us, they were on his errand. Like us sometimes, geographically they didn’t have very far to go. Left to their own strength against the contrary winds, they toiled against the sea for several hours attempting to cover the few miles to their destination. Exhausted from the struggle at their oars, they were almost certainly also deeply discouraged and frightened as the ship stalled against the waves in the midst of the sea. Jesus came unto them while they were doing what he asked, walking on the water as he approached the troubled ship. Sensing their fear, Jesus calmed them by saying, “Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid” (Matthew 14:27).</p>
<p>I have been especially touched by his patience with Peter when he bid him to come unto him upon the water. When Peter was focused on Christ, he actually defied a little gravity. Distracted by the swirling storm, he began to sink and became desperate for help. I wonder if the experience of being lifted by grasping the Lord’s outstretched hand was so deeply impressed upon his mind and soul that it prompted the great faith necessary during his own ministry, several years later, to lift the lame man by the hand at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, when he, fastening his eyes upon him, said, “Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk” (Acts 3:6).</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, during the last week of his mortal life, at the tender and intense occasion of the Last Supper, Jesus very plainly reminded his disciples of his impending death and resurrection. They would soon be without his personal companionship and would be scattered, but he would send to them the Holy Ghost. With compassion he comforted and consoled their troubled hearts:</p>
<p><i>The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</i>[John 16:27, 33]</p>
<p>President Benson has said:</p>
<p><i>Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar His face is to us. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>God loves us, he’s watching us, he wants us to succeed. </i>[Ezra Taft Benson, “<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/ezra-taft-benson_jesus-christ-gifts-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J<span style="color: #33cccc;">esus Christ—Gifts and Expectations</span></a>,” <i>Speeches of the Year, 1974 </i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), p. 313; also, Christmas Devotional, Salt Lake City, Utah, 7 December 1986]</p>
<p>Whether in illness, or feeling uncertainty for the future or fear or deep concern for our families or others, the Lord listens and knows and responds—the Lord is generous with his spirit.</p>
<p>I know this much better in retrospect. When I was a boy my mother and father were disenchanted with the traditional religion of their ancestors. Our family attended a church that was doctrinally unstructured and open. After my father died my mother stuck with it for a few more years, long enough for me to graduate from sixth-grade Sunday School. Though I participated in no organized religion from then on, I remember several occasions feeling quite confident that “things would work out” with no apparent basis for my inner assurance. I felt guided where to attend school and what major to pursue. That choice led to other momentous ones. I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints near the end of my first year of graduate school in Indiana. My master’s thesis advisor baptized me. I first became acquainted with him in a freshman chemistry laboratory, where I was excited to learn that he was involved in auto racing. We became fast friends, and his family became my family away from home. Little did I know that they were expert examples of President McKay’s description “every member a missionary.”</p>
<p>We started a racing club at the school, and I helped build various racing cars with this man. During my undergraduate years we drove long distances to professional drag races around the country, where he worked as an official and I helped on the crew. Interspersed with discussions during those many hours about racing, cars, and horsepower, I was introduced to his intriguing philosophy of who we were, where we came from, and where we were going. Did I want to know more? Absolutely! The plan of salvation “rang true,” and I began to appreciate the source of the good cheer I had felt growing up. Our conversations evolved to lengthy gospel discussions that gave me much to think about. The missionaries were somewhat taken aback when I answered “the LDS Church” to their question “Mr. Brown, what church do you know most about?” It was obviously a big decision to join the Church, but no bigger to me then than are some of the key decisions facing you now. I think the ability to be, in some small way, of good cheer helped me to think more clearly and to use my agency without error.</p>
<p>Before I was baptized I had decided to pursue a doctoral degree in mechanical engineering. One of my professors had just completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and told me of exciting work in my area of interest. I applied and was accepted to begin a Ph.D. program at Stanford the next fall. After my baptism I was interviewed by my bishop on several occasions. During one visit we talked about my plans. As I remember, I didn’t hesitate to change them when he counseled me to attend BYU, where I could meet my wife. So I did change my plans, and I did meet my wife. I’ve gained great comfort from my personal knowledge that the Lord has prompted and continues to prompt leaders and friends to influence my life at crucial and important times.</p>
<p>I bear testimony that the Lord knows each of you. We are numbered and nourished to keep us in the right way (see Moroni 6:4). This has been evidenced to me again and again in my teaching experience at BYU. In religion classes that I have had the privilege of teaching from time to time, I have usually given a series of assignments called “achievements.” Depending on the particular achievement, students are required to teach a gospel principle to someone else or to improve their private religious lives in some way and then to write an account of their experience and what they learned. One achievement was based on Alma 32 and involved not procrastinating acting on a prompting. In pondering the assignment, one student was prompted to visit a friend she hadn’t seen in almost a year. She was tempted to ignore the prompting but decided to not procrastinate acting upon it. When she went to her friend’s house, she found her alone in a seriously ill and deteriorating condition. Emergency hospitalization was necessary, which led to the recovery of the friend. The Lord himself said, “For behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered” (3 Nephi 18:31).</p>
<p>A recent visit with one of our stake patriarchs gave me another reminder. His testimony from giving many patriarchal blessings to young people in our stake is that the Lord’s love for the youth is overwhelming. That we each can obtain the Lord’s mind and will in the form of personal scripture at the hands of an ordained patriarch is a tremendous manifestation of his love for us. I can imagine the Lord impressing the words <i>be of good cheer </i>onto your mind as you read and ponder your patriarchal blessing.</p>
<p>Though my daughter attends BYU, I am not so ancient that I cannot remember the kinds of struggles and hopes that you have as college students. It is dangerous to compare ourselves with others, but perhaps we are safe in considering one of the featured creatures in Dr. Seuss’ profound book <i>Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?</i></p>
<p><i>When I was quite young</i><br />
<i>and quite small for my size,</i><br />
<i>I met an old man in the Desert of Drize. </i><br />
<i>And he sang me a song I will never forget. </i><br />
<i>At least, well, I haven’t forgotten it yet.</i></p>
<p><i>He sat in a terribly prickly place.</i><br />
<i>But he sang with a sunny sweet smile on his face:</i><br />
<i>When you think things are bad,</i><br />
<i>when you feel sour and blue,</i><br />
<i>when you start to get mad . . .</i><br />
<i>you should do what </i>I <i>do!</i></p>
<p><i>Just tell yourself, Duckie, </i><br />
<i>you’re really quite lucky!</i><br />
<i>Some people are much more . . . </i><br />
<i>oh, ever so much more . . .</i><br />
<i>oh, muchly much-much more </i><br />
<i>unlucky than you! . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . consider the Schlottz,</i><br />
<i>the Crumple-horn, Web-footed, Green-bearded Schlottz,</i><br />
<i>whose tail is entailed with un-solvable knots.</i><br />
<i>If </i>he <i>isn’t muchly</i><br />
<i>more worse off than you,</i><br />
<i>I’ll eat my umbrella.</i><br />
<i>That’s just what I’ll do.</i><br />
[Dr. Seuss, <i>Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are? </i>(New York: Random House, 1973), pp. 3–5, 20]</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the Lord’s exhortation to be of good cheer is an invitation to come unto Christ. It comes without an expiration date—it is always open. You have important decisions to make and pressures from all sides. I hope that on this campus you feel encouragement and support from the faculty and leaders. My experience with my colleagues is that you are loved and respected. If I may speak for them, we are concerned for your welfare and happiness. We understand something of your challenges. We are grateful for your faithfulness and consider it a privilege to work with you.</p>
<p>While the inflationary economics of entropy create disorder and confusion, the reversibility of sin begs us to apply the atonement of Christ through repentance to continually move toward the Savior. We are reminded weekly to “always remember him” that we “may always have his Spirit” to be with us (D&amp;C 20:77). Might it be that we remember him because he first remembers us? Though he can forget our sins, he will always remember us, for he said: “Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.” And, in reference to our God-given ability to obtain forgiveness for our sins and thereby undergo a reversible process, he said, “Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me” (1 Nephi 21:15–16).</p>
<p>The Lord’s exhortation to be of good cheer apparently created a spiritual momentum among his apostles that persisted through many experiences. It seems from the scriptural record that he repeated the admonition only at times that were especially trying or intense. Whether we need a mid course adjustment or a boost to keep moving, the inertial force of the following admonition to a small band of Saints during a dangerous journey down the Missouri river is powerful:</p>
<p><i>What I say unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you.</i></p>
<p><i>And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me, the blessings of the kingdom are yours. </i>[D&amp;C 61:36–37]</p>
<p>In the words of President Ezra Taft Benson:</p>
<p><i>He is the same loving, compassionate Lord today as when He walked the dusty roads of Palestine. He is close to His servants on this earth. He cares about and loves each of us today. Of that you can be assured.</i></p>
<p><i>He lives today as our Lord, our Master, our Savior, our Redeemer, and our God.</i></p>
<p><i>God bless us all to believe in Him, to accept Him, to worship Him, and to fully trust in Him. </i>[“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/11/jesus-christ-our-savior-and-redeemer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Jesus Christ: Our Savior and Redeemer</span></a>,” <i>Ensign, </i>November 1983, p. 8]</p>
<p>In the words of our dear prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley:</p>
<p><i>We have nothing to fear. God is at the helm. He will overrule for the good of this work. He will shower down blessings upon those who walk in obedience to His commandments. Such has been His promise. Of His ability to keep that promise none of us can doubt. </i>[“<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/05/this-is-the-work-of-the-master?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">This Is the Work of the Master</span></a>,” <i>Ensign, </i>May 1995, p.69]</p>
<p>I know the things that I have said today are true. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of God’s greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a heart’s electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.
When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!
Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.
Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The heart’s valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!
In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.
It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.
In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israel’s new king. As he looked over each of Jesse’s sons, the Lord taught Samuel, “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).
Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had “a beautiful countenance” and that “the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]” (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).
In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. My thanks go to those who provided the music this morning. Their music has helped to bring the Spirit to this meeting. I would hope to speak by that Spirit today.
My late friend Robert J. Matthews, who taught religion here at BYU, used to say, “If I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, you will hear things better than I say them.” I pray that that can happen today.
I thought it appropriate to begin with a little poem written by a young man that I think might illustrate what sometimes may happen in parents’ attempts to change the behavior of their children. He wrote:
My parents told me not to smoke—
I don’t. 
Nor listen to a naughty joke—
I don’t. 
They made it plain I must not wink
At pretty girls, or even think
About intoxicating drink—
I don’t. 
To dance and flirt is very wrong—
I don’t. 
Wild youths chase women, wine and song—
I don’t. 
I kiss no girls, not even one—
I do not know how it is done—
You wouldn’t think I had much fun—
I DON’T. 
[“I Don’t,” Goldendale Sentinel (Klickatat County, Washington), 24 October 1918, 1, gld.stparchive.com/Archive/GLD/GLD10241918P01.php]
Now, you see that this young man’s behavior was changed, but not his attitude. What is needed is a change in attitude as well as behavior. So I pose this question: What causes a change in attitude and behavior?
President Boyd K. Packer stated:
True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. 
The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. . . . That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel. [“Little Children,” Ensign, November 1986, 17]
The purpose of my presentation today is to explore four points of doctrine as found in the scriptures and in the words of the Brethren.
Principle Number 1: Draw upon the Power of the Word Daily
The prophet Mormon wrote:
And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. [Alma 31:5]
When I taught seminary years ago, I wanted to show the youth the power of the word that Alma described. I wanted to show them that if they would make the word of God (as found in the scriptures) a part of their lives, it would change them. I didn’t know exactly how to do that, but I tried this way.
On the first day of class I gave them a blank sheet of paper and s</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.
I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.
I remember a saying that I heard once: “A good laugh a day keeps the blues away.” I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep life’s ups and downs in perspective and balance.
Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: “Hey, anybody got a straw?” Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation—especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that it’s all right, we understand, or we’re here to help.
In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that “a merry heart doeth good like a medicine.” If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, “be of good cheer” (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a res</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I have imagined for the past two months what this would feel like, and my imagination doesn’t begin to compare with reality. I stand before you in amazement and awe at who you are. I can’t help but look at you and think of the days when I was a student at BYU. In fact, it was twenty years ago this month that I first met my dear sweetheart, Melinda.
I had been home from my mission for about four months, and I was attending my BYU ward for the first time. As the opening hymn began, I looked up at the person leading the music (as I should, right?), and she was the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen. That evening I saw her again at ward prayer, but I was way too scared to go up and introduce myself to her. Fortunately for me, Heavenly Father took care of that little detail by inspiring our bishop to assign us to the same family home evening group. They announced the new groups that very evening. We flirted for a few months before we finally started dating, and we were married the following June.
Since that time, every significant blessing that has come into my life I have shared with my best friend and eternal companion. I love every moment we get to spend together, and there are never enough of those moments!
Well, I know many of you are hoping for similar experiences sometime this year or maybe in the next few years. In fact, the beginning of a new semester or school year is filled with all kinds of hope and excitement for many different reasons. But, sadly, by the time we get to the end of the semester, with final projects and final exams, a lot of that hope has just plain vanished. I still remember the nightmare I used to have at the end of each semester in which I dreamed that I had forgotten to attend one of my classes for the entire semester. It was horrible! Funny enough, I had that same nightmare years later when I first became a professor, but that time I dreamed that I had forgotten to teach one of my classes for the entire semester. I just knew I was going to be fired.
What is it that happens between the beginning and end of a semester that drains us of our hope and excitement? Why is it so hard sometimes to be positive and upbeat? Well, I don’t know all the answers, to be sure, but I was accused at a very young age of being too positive, too upbeat, and even naïve sometimes about life. I can’t remember exactly when those accusations began, but when I was sixteen years old, an inspired patriarch placed his hands on my head and said the following:
Jeffrey, this is a good world. You will be positive in your thinking. You will think positively, you will speak positively, you will act positively. With all the negativism in the world today, you will sort it out and you will be happy because you will do the things which are pleasant and worthwhile.
I have seen this blessing come true countless times in my life, and I can testify that this world is a good world. There is so m</span>
