  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Before commencing my first semester at Brigham Young University, I had the opportunity of visiting Bourton-on-the-Water, a small village in the English Cotswolds. Replete with honey-colored houses, bridge-crossed brooks, and sheep-trodden meadows, the town represented all things quintessentially English. While wandering through the narrow streets along the Windrush River, I entered the Church of St. Lawrence. I thought that no one else occupied the silent church, but I soon noticed an elderly woman in a dark wool suit and sensible shoes sitting in the third pew from the altar.

At first I thought she was praying, but upon closer inspection I realized that she was doing needlepoint, so I felt more comfortable approaching her. We sat together for some time talking about everything from the local tourist sights to the latest tabloid embarrassment of the royal family. As we talked I became intrigued by her handiwork. She explained that she was making a prayer cushion like the dozens hanging from brass hooks on the pews around us. She carefully described the entire process--from the type of materials used to the time and patience required for completing such an undertaking. As a budding young economist, I asked her how much such an endeavor cost.

“I buy the materials for 30 pounds,” she replied.

Next I asked how much she charged for the prayer cushions.

“The church buys them for 20 pounds each,” she said.

Now it doesn’t take an economics major to do a profitability analysis of this cottage industry. As I puzzled over her 10-pound loss and obviously irrational economic behavior, she responded with a somewhat bewildered smile, saying, “Oh, but you mustn’t think in that way!”

Awkwardly I considered her admonition before responding that all that really mattered was that she derived a great deal of pleasure from her efforts. By saying so I graciously restored her economic sensibility. Again she looked at me with the same smile. I could almost hear her say in response, “Oh, but you mustn’t think in that way either!”

Not knowing how to think, I said good-bye and excused myself. It wasn’t until some time later, long after I left the Church of St. Lawrence and the Cotswold hills, that I understood her primary motivation. Her labors were not a profit-maximizing investment decision; neither were they necessarily an exploration of her passion. Rather, she consecrated her needlepoint prayer cushions as a simple gift to her God and her fellow parishioners. Therein lay the importance of her act and her fulfillment in the action.

I am reminded of that sage woman as I reflect today upon our experiences at Brigham Young University. With hard-earned degrees in hand, we might be inclined to congratulate ourselves on an important investment in human capital. We have all devoted significant time, effort, money, and talent to acquiring these important degrees. Although our undergraduate and graduate programs have prepared us to encounter the world with necessary and refined training and skills, we should remind ourselves of the elderly woman’s wise saying: “You mustn’t think of it in that way!” Our years here were more than just an economically profitable investment.

Our university experience has given each of us ample opportunity to explore our passions through many general education and special interest classes. My passion for studying the literature of the American West and northern European baroque art history has taken me to unexpectedly beautiful places. I hope that each of us has experienced that same unparalleled excitement about learning varied subjects during our time here. Finding and developing our passions have been critical elements of our education, but, as I say that, I can see the old woman smiling and hear her saying, “You mustn’t think of it in that way either!” Our years here were more than just an exploration of our passions.

When I reflect upon our experience here at Brigham Young University, I realize that, like the prayer cushions in Bourton-on-the-Water, our education is also a gift that we must consecrate for the benefit of those around us. More important than developing our careers or passions, our unique secular and spiritual education at Brigham Young University has developed within us the capacity to “go forth to serve” so that we might more fully bless the lives of others.

I’m confident that for the Cotswold woman, seeing her prayer cushions used every week in church gave her great satisfaction in knowing that she’d done some good in her corner of the world. However, I’m also sure that she never imagined that six years later and 5,000 miles away, her attitude of consecration would continue to inspire an economics student whom she probably doesn’t even remember. Whether building freeways, preserving history, raising families, teaching students, or healing patients, we will each see the direct impact of our education on the lives of others. But, like the Cotswold woman, consecrating our education and cultivating a giving attitude will enable us to bless many more individuals than just those who use our freeways, read our histories, meet our families, learn in our classrooms, or receive our care. These will be the people who years later and thousands of miles away will not necessarily remember what we did but rather how we did it.

As graduates we can follow the examples of consecration given us by loving families, loyal friends, inspired professors, wise leaders, and humble tithe payers from around the world--some of whom are in attendance today. This class was sustained and supported by individuals who gave freely and unselfishly of their time, talents, energy, and resources to make our experience here possible. They never thought in that way, preoccupying themselves with their own economies and passions. They truly understood that we must think in terms of serving our fellow brothers and sisters and our Father in Heaven. Through their attitude of consecration they have blessed the lives of many more than just those individuals whom they have come to see today. On behalf of the entire graduating class and a wise woman in sensible shoes, I extend our sincere appreciation.

Thank you.

			<p>Before commencing my first semester at Brigham Young University, I had the opportunity of visiting Bourton-on-the-Water, a small village in the English Cotswolds. Replete with honey-colored houses, bridge-crossed brooks, and sheep-trodden meadows, the town represented all things quintessentially English. While wandering through the narrow streets along the Windrush River, I entered the Church of St. Lawrence. I thought that no one else occupied the silent church, but I soon noticed an elderly woman in a dark wool suit and sensible shoes sitting in the third pew from the altar.</p>
<p>At first I thought she was praying, but upon closer inspection I realized that she was doing needlepoint, so I felt more comfortable approaching her. We sat together for some time talking about everything from the local tourist sights to the latest tabloid embarrassment of the royal family. As we talked I became intrigued by her handiwork. She explained that she was making a prayer cushion like the dozens hanging from brass hooks on the pews around us. She carefully described the entire process&#8211;from the type of materials used to the time and patience required for completing such an undertaking. As a budding young economist, I asked her how much such an endeavor cost.</p>
<p>“I buy the materials for 30 pounds,” she replied.</p>
<p>Next I asked how much she charged for the prayer cushions.</p>
<p>“The church buys them for 20 pounds each,” she said.</p>
<p>Now it doesn’t take an economics major to do a profitability analysis of this cottage industry. As I puzzled over her 10-pound loss and obviously irrational economic behavior, she responded with a somewhat bewildered smile, saying, “Oh, but you mustn’t think in that way!”</p>
<p>Awkwardly I considered her admonition before responding that all that really mattered was that she derived a great deal of pleasure from her efforts. By saying so I graciously restored her economic sensibility. Again she looked at me with the same smile. I could almost hear her say in response, “Oh, but you mustn’t think in that way either!”</p>
<p>Not knowing how to think, I said good-bye and excused myself. It wasn’t until some time later, long after I left the Church of St. Lawrence and the Cotswold hills, that I understood her primary motivation. Her labors were not a profit-maximizing investment decision; neither were they necessarily an exploration of her passion. Rather, she consecrated her needlepoint prayer cushions as a simple gift to her God and her fellow parishioners. Therein lay the importance of her act and her fulfillment in the action.</p>
<p>I am reminded of that sage woman as I reflect today upon our experiences at Brigham Young University. With hard-earned degrees in hand, we might be inclined to congratulate ourselves on an important investment in human capital. We have all devoted significant time, effort, money, and talent to acquiring these important degrees. Although our undergraduate and graduate programs have prepared us to encounter the world with necessary and refined training and skills, we should remind ourselves of the elderly woman’s wise saying: “You mustn’t think of it in that way!” Our years here were more than just an economically profitable investment.</p>
<p>Our university experience has given each of us ample opportunity to explore our passions through many general education and special interest classes. My passion for studying the literature of the American West and northern European baroque art history has taken me to unexpectedly beautiful places. I hope that each of us has experienced that same unparalleled excitement about learning varied subjects during our time here. Finding and developing our passions have been critical elements of our education, but, as I say that, I can see the old woman smiling and hear her saying, “You mustn’t think of it in that way either!” Our years here were more than just an exploration of our passions.</p>
<p>When I reflect upon our experience here at Brigham Young University, I realize that, like the prayer cushions in Bourton-on-the-Water, our education is also a gift that we must consecrate for the benefit of those around us. More important than developing our careers or passions, our unique secular and spiritual education at Brigham Young University has developed within us the capacity to “go forth to serve” so that we might more fully bless the lives of others.</p>
<p>I’m confident that for the Cotswold woman, seeing her prayer cushions used every week in church gave her great satisfaction in knowing that she’d done some good in her corner of the world. However, I’m also sure that she never imagined that six years later and 5,000 miles away, her attitude of consecration would continue to inspire an economics student whom she probably doesn’t even remember. Whether building freeways, preserving history, raising families, teaching students, or healing patients, we will each see the direct impact of our education on the lives of others. But, like the Cotswold woman, consecrating our education and cultivating a giving attitude will enable us to bless many more individuals than just those who use our freeways, read our histories, meet our families, learn in our classrooms, or receive our care. These will be the people who years later and thousands of miles away will not necessarily remember what we did but rather how we did it.</p>
<p>As graduates we can follow the examples of consecration given us by loving families, loyal friends, inspired professors, wise leaders, and humble tithe payers from around the world&#8211;some of whom are in attendance today. This class was sustained and supported by individuals who gave freely and unselfishly of their time, talents, energy, and resources to make our experience here possible. They never thought in that way, preoccupying themselves with their own economies and passions. They truly understood that we must think in terms of serving our fellow brothers and sisters and our Father in Heaven. Through their attitude of consecration they have blessed the lives of many more than just those individuals whom they have come to see today. On behalf of the entire graduating class and a wise woman in sensible shoes, I extend our sincere appreciation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is good to be with you this morning. While in a moment I will draw on the academic disciplines of Egyptology and biblical studies, in which I have been so steeped over the last few decades, I want to start out by trying to draw an analogy from one of my favorite things to do: waterskiing. The way I read the accounts of the Savior and Peter on the Sea of Galilee, it seems to me that waterskiing is the closest thing we have to a celestial sport. I can’t get enough of it. In fact, one year my brothers, a cousin, and I made the goal of skiing on Utah Lake every month of the year. During January and February we questioned the wisdom of this goal, but we did it. I skied every time I got the chance.
During all these years of waterskiing I have had the chance to teach a lot of people how to ski. I believe I taught around 100 people. As I did so, I realized that there are really only three things people have to do to learn how to ski. The first is to keep their skis together. Often the pressure of the water will cause a person to do the splits, and it is very hard to ski that way. But there are ways to tie skis together, so this isn’t the biggest problem.
The most difficult problem comes because you have an instinctive tendency to try to stand on top of the water as the boat pulls you. As a result, just as the boat pulls people up, most of them pull on the rope and push with their legs. Instead of being helpful, both of these actions tend to pull people’s legs out from under them, and they immediately fall. Most of the time the action of pulling on the rope was so instinctive that people didn’t even realize they had done it. I can’t tell you how many times I repeated the mantra “arms straight, knees bent, skis together.” I would explain again and again that the boat was strong enough to pull a person up—they just had to be patient enough to let it.
Here is the lesson: When those I taught learned to forget about using their own strength to get up and relied on the power of the boat, they would ski. When you master your impulse to pull yourself up, you get on top of the water; then the ability to accelerate, cut through the water, float on a sea of glass, and sail with an amazing feeling of freedom and exhilaration is waiting for you.
While this analogy can be applied in a number of ways, today I want to compare it to something I have seen that ancient Israel struggled with. During the two decades I have been teaching the Old Testament, I have found that for most of us it just seems weird when we read about ancient Israel’s struggles with idolatry. We cannot imagine why they would stop worshipping Jehovah and instead worship things carved from wood or stone or molded from metal. We ask ourselves, “What were they thinking? What is wrong with them?” Yet I have found that we should never ask ourselves, “What is wrong with them?” Instead we should ask, “What is wrong with them and me?” If ancient I</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I begin today by paying tribute to President Cecil O. Samuelson and his wife, Sister Sharon G. Samuelson. The Samuelsons were asked by President Gordon B. Hinckley to lead the university for what they expected would be five to seven years, and they were here for eleven. President and Sister Samuelson had longtime and deep personal, family, and professional ties to the University of Utah. Yet because of their profound faith, when the call came to serve here, they turned immediately from red to blue, inside and out. Their loyalty to BYU went much deeper than duty.
President Samuelson has been a remarkable leader: insightful and incisive, with the wisdom and experience of a seasoned administrator in a variety of settings. He was unapologetic about his high academic standards. Despite his driven interest in the institution of BYU, he quietly made himself available to individuals who sought his listening ear and counsel. He was guided by an absolute commitment to do what was right, not what was popular. He had the ability to capitalize on the strengths of those around him, despite being acutely aware of their weaknesses.
The university was everything in the Samuelsons’ lives from early morning to late night, seven days a week, and in my interactions with them I never once heard them complain. While he would never want it to be said this way because he has no need for acclaim, President Samuelson has left an indelible mark on the university. Programs are stronger, processes are improved, and resources are more carefully administered. For the Samuelsons’ service we can be deeply grateful.
President Samuelson leaves a stronger university in the hands of our new president, Kevin J Worthen. President Worthen brings a long history with and deep love for BYU to his new assignment. He is well prepared to assume this responsibility. He is an academic who is distinguished in his own career in the J. Reuben Clark Law School, and he is fiercely committed to the Church, which sponsors BYU, and to the BYU Board of Trustees, whose support and direction are a vital part of BYU and our mission.
President Worthen has already shown himself to be accessible, student oriented, an authentic listener, and a willing and ready learner, and he enjoys a good laugh. He is collegial and congenial, and while he is a quick study, he is also deliberative and collaborative in his decision making. By his side is his wife, Peggy, who, by President Worthen’s own admission, is a primary motivating and inspiring force behind his leadership. I welcome President Worthen by saying what the board already knows: They and we can be confident that firm, capable, and experienced hands are at the helm of Brigham Young University.
From the very establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ in this dispensation, the education of the Latter-day Saints has been a prophetic priority. For 180 years Church presidents have spoken emphatically regarding the central</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I appreciate this opportunity very much. I am grateful for my loving wife of nearly 41 years, who is sitting near me on the stand today. She is a pillar of great strength in all that we do. I also acknowledge the attendance of family and friends and appreciate their support.
I was reflecting on the many special occasions I have experienced here in this building. My wife and I with our infant son moved here to BYU in January of 1971—nearly 40 years ago. The Marriott Center was just being completed at that time, and we were able to attend some of those early meetings and basketball games.
One of my fondest Marriott Center memories is the dedication of the Provo Temple in 1972. President Joseph Fielding Smith was presiding—we sat right about there, two-thirds of the way up. At the conclusion of that ceremony, with our white handkerchiefs in hand, thousands of young student voices sang “The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning.” The Spirit of God was burning that day as we raised our voices in the glorious shout that concludes every dedication.
In like manner, I remember the quiet reverence of not too many months ago when we watched President Gordon B. Hinckley come through the portal right over there, waving his cane at us with fun in his eyes. That too was a time of deep emotion and connection with the Spirit.
Several years ago I was immersed in one of my favorite callings in the Church: I was working with the youth. On one outing we were deep in the middle of a several-day rafting trip on the Grande Ronde River in the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness of northeastern Oregon. After a long stretch of rapids and splashing each other’s boats, we stopped for a rest, and the Varsity Scouts were anxious to run wild. As they began to run up the steep hillside, my co-Scout leader yelled at them with his best drill sergeant’s voice: “STOP!” Surprisingly, two or three of them actually did stop, which I found amazing. He said, “Look around you.” They looked and shrugged with a look of blank indifference. Then he said, “You are standing in the middle of a large patch of poison oak.” Suddenly, the world looked very different to them. What had before been harmless brush now became dangerous, vivid, and brilliant. Their training about three shiny leaves jumped out at them in dazzling reality.
We have been asked to take a risky journey and plunge ourselves deep into the foliage of the world, and we are attempting to do so while avoiding the toxins that irritate and can potentially destroy the sensitive skin of our souls. The Savior said, “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but . . . ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world” (John 15:19).
We often like to summarize the Savior’s counsel and claim that we are in the world but not of the world. In a recent book by Charles Taylor entitled A Secular Age, the author suggests that society has transf</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning! It is a cherished privilege to share this time with you this morning. Thirty years of college teaching, 32 years of parenthood, 40 years of Church service, and 45 years of performing as a musician have convinced me that I am nothing. As to my own strength, I am weak, and I must depend fully upon the Lord if I am to succeed in accomplishing anything good. You recognize those are nearly the words of Ammon in the chapter 26 of the book of Alma (see verses 11–12). Moroni said something very similar:
And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be because of unbelief.
And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God. [Moroni 10:24–25]
I know that is true! Those of us who have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost will never achieve our full potential without His presence in our lives. In the words of the Savior Himself:
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. [John 15:4–5]
I know I am completely dependent on the Lord, but despite my weaknesses and inadequacies and my mistakes and even failures, in His strength many good things have also been accomplished.
Early in my life, at age three, I began a string of experiences when I contracted polio that would always make me feel a keen sense of dependence on the Lord. This happened about six months before the vaccine was released that has now nearly eliminated this devastating disease in the United States. When we have the capacity to accomplish great good, there is always commensurate opposition and adversity to try to prevent us from fulfilling our potential. I have never begrudged having this challenge in my life because I think it has blessed me in my spiritual and musical development more than it could ever hinder me. I believe, too, that the Lord has used this adversity in my life to better prepare me for a world dominated by humanism. Humanists believe that man must succeed completely on his own abilities with no supernatural power to help. They believe in depending on themselves, not on the Lord. There is a terrifying scripture in the book of Helaman about that. In chapter 4, verse 13, Mormon describes the people of that time: “And because of . . . their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper.”
I needed and felt extra power from the Lord from early in my life. Because of the polio, I went through a series of surgical operations. Each time I faced on</span>
