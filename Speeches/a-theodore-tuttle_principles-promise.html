  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My dear fellow students, it is always a pleasant occasion to come to Brigham Young University. But it is likewise an awesome responsibility. For that reason I am grateful for that beautiful prayer by Brother Turner and pray with you that it will be fulfilled in our behalf.

Some of you may remember the 1970 space flight of Apollo 13. It was to be man’s third landing on the moon. The launching was perfect, the first 205,000 miles of flight flawless. Then, on the evening of the third day, Jack Swigert’s voice suddenly crackled into the mission spacecraft center in Houston: “Hey, we’ve got a problem here.” What had been an almost boring trip was instantly transformed into a frantic struggle to rescue the three astronauts from the prospect of a death no man had experienced before—death while drifting endlessly in space.

As the tense drama unfolded, it was learned that one of the two essential oxygen tanks in the service module had exploded. A leak from the other tank showed on the spaceship’s dials. Clearly they were in trouble. These tanks supplied not only the critical oxygen but power and water as well. And now they had only a limited supply.

As soon as mission control in Houston was advised, everyone went into action. They mounted a massive rescue operation involving at least 10,000 people. The landing on the moon was aborted; the total effort now was to return the crew safely to the earth. You probably recall the rest of the story. You may even have been part of the largest television audience in history as it watched Apollo 13’s final descent. Out of the scores of evaluations made on the whole experience, there was agreement on one point: The crew was rescued because they &lt;i&gt;received&lt;/i&gt; constant direction from mission control at Houston and &lt;i&gt;followed&lt;/i&gt; that direction.

In many respects, their experience is like your journey through life. A wise Father has launched you on your earthly journey. He has provided most of the essentials for the trip, though some of them are in limited supply. Like those astronauts, your ultimate goal is to get back where you came from, and in the process you have a mission to perform. You face some challenging times, all right. Sometimes you get yourselves into trouble. When that happens, you have to change your course and get back on the right track; we call that process repentance. Repentance simply means changing your course and getting back on the path.

Signals from your “mission control headquarters” are always coming through. Whether or not you are able to receive them depends on the condition of your “receiving sets.” As you students take your journey on your own, keep your “receiving sets” in good condition. There are laws that govern your ability to receive the signals. You need to understand the operation of law in your life.

There are many laws; for example, there is Murphy’s Law. I am sure you are all acquainted with that: “If anything can go wrong, it will.” Then there is O’Toole’s Commentary on Murphy’s Law; he said, “Murphy was an optimist.” There is also the law of gravity. You understand that, but perhaps you are not aware of Murgatroyd’s Observation on the law of gravity—that “any object will fall so as to cause the most damage.” Jenning’s Commentary on Murgatroyd’s Observation is that “the chance of bread falling with the buttered side down is directly proportional to the cost of the carpet.”

While I do not deny the operation of such “laws,” I want to put into better perspective some of God’s laws.

For your journey through life, one of the first things you need to know is:

&lt;i&gt;There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]

I want to repeat that. “There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of the world, upon which all blessings are predicated—and when we obtain any blessings from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.”

Ponder that thought. This great revelation did not evolve from man’s reason; it was revealed from heaven. It sets forth unmistakably the fact that there are principles upon which promises are predicated, and that obedience is the key to receiving blessings. This revelation gives you “knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come” (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). In other words, it is truth. Perhaps the operation of this law can best be seen in the account of God’s relationship with the people of the Book of Mormon. Numerous verses in the Book of Mormon emphasize the truth of this law. One may illustrate the many: “Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence (2 Nephi 1:20). There are many others (see 2 Nephi 1:19, 20, 26; 4:4; 26:32–33; Omni 6; Mosiah 1:7; 2:23–24; 2:31; Alma 9:13–14; 36:1, 30; 37:13; 38:1; 3 Nephi 5:22).

In conjunction with laws, principles, or truth (and I will use them interchangeably, though technically they differ somewhat), there is generally a condition and a promise, either stated or implied. Note:

&lt;i&gt;Unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 88:38–39]

And another, “For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world” (D&amp;amp;C 132:5).

Concerning law Elder McConkie has written:

&lt;i&gt;All things are governed by law; nothing is exempt. In the eternal perspective there is no such thing as chance; in the divine economy the same in varying result always flows from the same cause. These principles are immutable, eternal, everlasting; they apply to all things both temporal and spiritual. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There is no whim, chance, or caprice in the operation of gospel law. Divine blessings always result from obedience to the law upon which their receipt is predicated. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

[In this same discussion Elder McConkie said,] &lt;i&gt;Once a law has been ordained, it thereafter operates automatically; that is, whenever there is compliance with its terms and conditions, the promised &lt;/i&gt;[blessings]&lt;i&gt;accrue. . . .&lt;/i&gt; [Bruce R. McConkie, &lt;i&gt;Mormon Doctrine,&lt;/i&gt; p. 395]

Usually when we consider laws we are inclined to think of them as being something very restrictive, something that holds us down. We frequently think of law as the opposite of liberty. That is not so; law is the basis of freedom. It can be likened to the situation of the astronauts. When they were advised to move into the lunar module and stay there in order to save precious oxygen for the return trip in the command module, it was not only cold but cramped. Commander Lovell described their condition to mission control: “Fred [Haise]’s sleeping place is now in the tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the ascent engine cover. . . .Jack [Swigert] is on the floor . . . with a restraint harness wrapped around his arm to keep him there” (&lt;i&gt;Newsweek,&lt;/i&gt; April 27, 1970, p. 25). The result of their obedience, however, eventually freed them from certain death in space.

I suppose you too have felt a bit shackled by some of God’s laws. On occasion any one of you may have wanted to physically express some natural feelings toward another but were restricted from improper actions by obedience to the law of chastity. At the time you may have felt resentment against the restraints of law. Obedience, however, frees you from remorse. Obedience brings inner peace. In quieter moments, are you not grateful for such restraint?

Another illustration may help. A father was out with his son flying a kite. He had let nearly all the string go out. As the little boy watched the kite go higher and higher, he said, “Daddy, let all the string out. Let go of it. Let it fly clear up to the sky!”

The wise father, seeing an opportunity to teach a lesson, replied, “Oh, no, my son. If we were to let go of the string the kite would come down. We have to keep a hold on it to keep the kite up. You see, ofttimes the things that hold you down are really the things that keep you up.”

Some people look at fences as though they were there to keep them out, when in reality they mark paths to guide them in.

I would like to cite several illustrations of the principles and promises our Heavenly Father has given to guide you along your journey. The first one is sometimes called “the law of the harvest.”

&lt;i&gt;Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.&lt;/i&gt; [Galatians 6:7]

If you sow seeds that are lustful and sensuous, you shall reap regret; and the labor of that season is lost. Ultimately corruption shall follow just as surely as one season follows another. On the other hand, the promise is equally true that the seeds of honor and virtue will one day bring the crowning gift of life everlasting.

Most of you have seen the film &lt;i&gt;The Ten Commandments.&lt;/i&gt; You may recall Cecil B. DeMille’s introduction to this epic, in which he recites the great lesson taught by history and the experience of the ages: “We cannot break [God’s laws]. We can only “break ourselves against them.” Ponder that thought. This principle applies to physical, moral, or spiritual laws.

You may be thinking of someone you know who is misbehaving yet seems to be happy and to have no problems. You wonder how this principle can possibly be true. Does it apply to everyone? Remember, God does not balance his books in October, but balance them he will. We look at things with limited vision; he judges things in eternal perspective. The decisions between the way of the flesh and the way of the spirit have eternal implications. They become the most crucial decisions you will ever make. You will not only reap what you sow in kind; you will reap what you sow abundantly. Nature provides bountiful blossoms from only a few seeds. The law of the harvest is unfailing. Plant only what you will be willing to harvest abundantly.

The Word of Wisdom was

&lt;i&gt;Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation—&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tobacco is not for the body. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And . . . hot drinks&lt;/i&gt; [meaning tea and coffee]&lt;i&gt; are not for the body. . . .&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 89:3–5, 8–9]

Then comes the marvelous promise of health, wisdom, strength, and life.

&lt;i&gt;And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, &lt;/i&gt;shall receive health &lt;i&gt;in their navel and marrow to their bones;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;shall find wisdom &lt;i&gt;and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I, the Lord, &lt;/i&gt;give unto them a promise, &lt;i&gt;that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 89:19–21; emphasis added]

During the last world war I served in the Marine Corps. We were required to undergo extreme physical hardships, not only in training but in combat at Iwo Jima. I had never been especially robust in my youth, and when these occasions had to be met I needed extra strength. I had faithfully observed the Word of Wisdom all my life. During times of stress I asked the Lord to fulfill the promises he had made in the Word of Wisdom. From my own personal experience, I know this principle is true.

Another principle with promise is the law of tithing. I am selecting those principles that illustrate the unerring operation of divine law. I select those also that help to keep your “receiving sets” in good condition.

&lt;i&gt;Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith . . .&lt;/i&gt; [The Lord is emphasizing a principle with a promise—in fact, three promises] &lt;i&gt;if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the fields. . .&lt;/i&gt; . [What is the devourer? It is anything that devours your substance and keeps you from prospering.]

&lt;i&gt;And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.&lt;/i&gt; [3 Nephi 24:10–12]

In the present dispensation the Lord has promised an added blessing for its faithful observance: “For he that is tithed shall not be burned . . .” (D&amp;amp;C 64:23). (You can understand why some have facetiously spoken of obedience to this law as “fire insurance.”)

If any of you think that you do not have enough money to pay tithing, let me share with you an observation. People pay tithing not because they have money, but because they have faith. When they comply with the law, the promise then becomes operative and can be fulfilled.

As I have traveled about the Church, it has been my privilege to mingle with those who have much and with those who have very little. Those who have complied with the law of tithing have received the promised blessings. Blessings have not always come in material ways, but blessings have truly come. The principle always works. I have heard testimonies to this truth, and I know of myself the principle is true. Do you think that I would teach you those principles if I did not know that they were true? They will be fulfilled in your behalf. I want to see your lives blessed by observance of these principles.

The law of the Sabbath also illustrates this principle.

[Note the purpose of the Sabbath day:] &lt;i&gt;And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world,&lt;/i&gt; [is there anyone who does not want to do that?] &lt;i&gt;thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day&lt;/i&gt; [a sacrament is a spiritual covenant];

&lt;i&gt;For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High.&lt;/i&gt;

To “rest from your labors,” you stop the regular weekly routine in order to have time to do the work of the Lord and to worship the Lord on the Sabbath day. Note the promise if we do so.

&lt;i&gt;Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this,&lt;/i&gt; the fullness of the earth is yours . . .

&lt;i&gt;And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 59:9–10, 16, 20, 23; emphasis added]

Do you want to miss this promise? All mankind is seeking for peace. Yet peace—inner peace—and eternal life are within your grasp if you will but reach out and claim them by doing the works of righteousness.

(I hope that sometime your great president will share with you his university experience—the pressures to study on the Sabbath day, his refusal to do it, and his testimony of how the Lord fulfills His promises.)

Finally, I would suggest an additional dimension to your relationship to law. The Lord expects you to pursue righteousness.

&lt;i&gt;For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that obeys not my commandments?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled. But, wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 58:26–33]

The Lord has given you this earthly experience. He has established laws to guide you. He has promised blessings for obedience. He wants you to return to live with him. Like the crew of Apollo 13, you cannot get “home” without direction from heaven. Like them, you may be oblivious to a hurricane boiling toward your splash-down area. Were you not guided by revelation from God, you could easily lose contact, wander off your course, and find yourself in outer darkness where you must drift eternally. If, however, you will listen to and follow divine direction, you can gain eternal life.

I testify that our Heavenly Father lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, and our Redeemer. President Kimball is his living prophet. Your safeguard on your journey through life is the constant direction from a wise and loving Heavenly Father. With all my heart I plead with you to listen, to obey, and to live. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>My dear fellow students, it is always a pleasant occasion to come to Brigham Young University. But it is likewise an awesome responsibility. For that reason I am grateful for that beautiful prayer by Brother Turner and pray with you that it will be fulfilled in our behalf.</p>
<p>Some of you may remember the 1970 space flight of Apollo 13. It was to be man’s third landing on the moon. The launching was perfect, the first 205,000 miles of flight flawless. Then, on the evening of the third day, Jack Swigert’s voice suddenly crackled into the mission spacecraft center in Houston: “Hey, we’ve got a problem here.” What had been an almost boring trip was instantly transformed into a frantic struggle to rescue the three astronauts from the prospect of a death no man had experienced before—death while drifting endlessly in space.</p>
<p>As the tense drama unfolded, it was learned that one of the two essential oxygen tanks in the service module had exploded. A leak from the other tank showed on the spaceship’s dials. Clearly they were in trouble. These tanks supplied not only the critical oxygen but power and water as well. And now they had only a limited supply.</p>
<p>As soon as mission control in Houston was advised, everyone went into action. They mounted a massive rescue operation involving at least 10,000 people. The landing on the moon was aborted; the total effort now was to return the crew safely to the earth. You probably recall the rest of the story. You may even have been part of the largest television audience in history as it watched Apollo 13’s final descent. Out of the scores of evaluations made on the whole experience, there was agreement on one point: The crew was rescued because they <i>received</i> constant direction from mission control at Houston and <i>followed</i> that direction.</p>
<p>In many respects, their experience is like your journey through life. A wise Father has launched you on your earthly journey. He has provided most of the essentials for the trip, though some of them are in limited supply. Like those astronauts, your ultimate goal is to get back where you came from, and in the process you have a mission to perform. You face some challenging times, all right. Sometimes you get yourselves into trouble. When that happens, you have to change your course and get back on the right track; we call that process repentance. Repentance simply means changing your course and getting back on the path.</p>
<p>Signals from your “mission control headquarters” are always coming through. Whether or not you are able to receive them depends on the condition of your “receiving sets.” As you students take your journey on your own, keep your “receiving sets” in good condition. There are laws that govern your ability to receive the signals. You need to understand the operation of law in your life.</p>
<p>There are many laws; for example, there is Murphy’s Law. I am sure you are all acquainted with that: “If anything can go wrong, it will.” Then there is O’Toole’s Commentary on Murphy’s Law; he said, “Murphy was an optimist.” There is also the law of gravity. You understand that, but perhaps you are not aware of Murgatroyd’s Observation on the law of gravity—that “any object will fall so as to cause the most damage.” Jenning’s Commentary on Murgatroyd’s Observation is that “the chance of bread falling with the buttered side down is directly proportional to the cost of the carpet.”</p>
<p>While I do not deny the operation of such “laws,” I want to put into better perspective some of God’s laws.</p>
<p>For your journey through life, one of the first things you need to know is:</p>
<p><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—</i></p>
<p><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i> [D&amp;C 130:20–21]</p>
<p>I want to repeat that. “There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of the world, upon which all blessings are predicated—and when we obtain any blessings from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.”</p>
<p>Ponder that thought. This great revelation did not evolve from man’s reason; it was revealed from heaven. It sets forth unmistakably the fact that there are principles upon which promises are predicated, and that obedience is the key to receiving blessings. This revelation gives you “knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come” (D&amp;C 93:24). In other words, it is truth. Perhaps the operation of this law can best be seen in the account of God’s relationship with the people of the Book of Mormon. Numerous verses in the Book of Mormon emphasize the truth of this law. One may illustrate the many: “Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence (2 Nephi 1:20). There are many others (see 2 Nephi 1:19, 20, 26; 4:4; 26:32–33; Omni 6; Mosiah 1:7; 2:23–24; 2:31; Alma 9:13–14; 36:1, 30; 37:13; 38:1; 3 Nephi 5:22).</p>
<p>In conjunction with laws, principles, or truth (and I will use them interchangeably, though technically they differ somewhat), there is generally a condition and a promise, either stated or implied. Note:</p>
<p><i>Unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.</i></p>
<p><i>All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.</i> [D&amp;C 88:38–39]</p>
<p>And another, “For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world” (D&amp;C 132:5).</p>
<p>Concerning law Elder McConkie has written:</p>
<p><i>All things are governed by law; nothing is exempt. In the eternal perspective there is no such thing as chance; in the divine economy the same in varying result always flows from the same cause. These principles are immutable, eternal, everlasting; they apply to all things both temporal and spiritual. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>There is no whim, chance, or caprice in the operation of gospel law. Divine blessings always result from obedience to the law upon which their receipt is predicated. . . .</i></p>
<p>[In this same discussion Elder McConkie said,] <i>Once a law has been ordained, it thereafter operates automatically; that is, whenever there is compliance with its terms and conditions, the promised </i>[blessings]<i>accrue. . . .</i> [Bruce R. McConkie, <i>Mormon Doctrine,</i> p. 395]</p>
<p>Usually when we consider laws we are inclined to think of them as being something very restrictive, something that holds us down. We frequently think of law as the opposite of liberty. That is not so; law is the basis of freedom. It can be likened to the situation of the astronauts. When they were advised to move into the lunar module and stay there in order to save precious oxygen for the return trip in the command module, it was not only cold but cramped. Commander Lovell described their condition to mission control: “Fred [Haise]’s sleeping place is now in the tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the ascent engine cover. . . .Jack [Swigert] is on the floor . . . with a restraint harness wrapped around his arm to keep him there” (<i>Newsweek,</i> April 27, 1970, p. 25). The result of their obedience, however, eventually freed them from certain death in space.</p>
<p>I suppose you too have felt a bit shackled by some of God’s laws. On occasion any one of you may have wanted to physically express some natural feelings toward another but were restricted from improper actions by obedience to the law of chastity. At the time you may have felt resentment against the restraints of law. Obedience, however, frees you from remorse. Obedience brings inner peace. In quieter moments, are you not grateful for such restraint?</p>
<p>Another illustration may help. A father was out with his son flying a kite. He had let nearly all the string go out. As the little boy watched the kite go higher and higher, he said, “Daddy, let all the string out. Let go of it. Let it fly clear up to the sky!”</p>
<p>The wise father, seeing an opportunity to teach a lesson, replied, “Oh, no, my son. If we were to let go of the string the kite would come down. We have to keep a hold on it to keep the kite up. You see, ofttimes the things that hold you down are really the things that keep you up.”</p>
<p>Some people look at fences as though they were there to keep them out, when in reality they mark paths to guide them in.</p>
<p>I would like to cite several illustrations of the principles and promises our Heavenly Father has given to guide you along your journey. The first one is sometimes called “the law of the harvest.”</p>
<p><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i></p>
<p><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i> [Galatians 6:7]</p>
<p>If you sow seeds that are lustful and sensuous, you shall reap regret; and the labor of that season is lost. Ultimately corruption shall follow just as surely as one season follows another. On the other hand, the promise is equally true that the seeds of honor and virtue will one day bring the crowning gift of life everlasting.</p>
<p>Most of you have seen the film <i>The Ten Commandments.</i> You may recall Cecil B. DeMille’s introduction to this epic, in which he recites the great lesson taught by history and the experience of the ages: “We cannot break [God’s laws]. We can only “break ourselves against them.” Ponder that thought. This principle applies to physical, moral, or spiritual laws.</p>
<p>You may be thinking of someone you know who is misbehaving yet seems to be happy and to have no problems. You wonder how this principle can possibly be true. Does it apply to everyone? Remember, God does not balance his books in October, but balance them he will. We look at things with limited vision; he judges things in eternal perspective. The decisions between the way of the flesh and the way of the spirit have eternal implications. They become the most crucial decisions you will ever make. You will not only reap what you sow in kind; you will reap what you sow abundantly. Nature provides bountiful blossoms from only a few seeds. The law of the harvest is unfailing. Plant only what you will be willing to harvest abundantly.</p>
<p>The Word of Wisdom was</p>
<p><i>Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation—</i></p>
<p><i>That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Tobacco is not for the body. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And . . . hot drinks</i> [meaning tea and coffee]<i> are not for the body. . . .</i> [D&amp;C 89:3–5, 8–9]</p>
<p>Then comes the marvelous promise of health, wisdom, strength, and life.</p>
<p><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, </i>shall receive health <i>in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i></p>
<p><i>And </i>shall find wisdom <i>and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i></p>
<p><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i></p>
<p><i>And I, the Lord, </i>give unto them a promise, <i>that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen. </i>[D&amp;C 89:19–21; emphasis added]</p>
<p>During the last world war I served in the Marine Corps. We were required to undergo extreme physical hardships, not only in training but in combat at Iwo Jima. I had never been especially robust in my youth, and when these occasions had to be met I needed extra strength. I had faithfully observed the Word of Wisdom all my life. During times of stress I asked the Lord to fulfill the promises he had made in the Word of Wisdom. From my own personal experience, I know this principle is true.</p>
<p>Another principle with promise is the law of tithing. I am selecting those principles that illustrate the unerring operation of divine law. I select those also that help to keep your “receiving sets” in good condition.</p>
<p><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith . . .</i> [The Lord is emphasizing a principle with a promise—in fact, three promises] <i>if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i></p>
<p><i>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the fields. . .</i> . [What is the devourer? It is anything that devours your substance and keeps you from prospering.]</p>
<p><i>And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.</i> [3 Nephi 24:10–12]</p>
<p>In the present dispensation the Lord has promised an added blessing for its faithful observance: “For he that is tithed shall not be burned . . .” (D&amp;C 64:23). (You can understand why some have facetiously spoken of obedience to this law as “fire insurance.”)</p>
<p>If any of you think that you do not have enough money to pay tithing, let me share with you an observation. People pay tithing not because they have money, but because they have faith. When they comply with the law, the promise then becomes operative and can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>As I have traveled about the Church, it has been my privilege to mingle with those who have much and with those who have very little. Those who have complied with the law of tithing have received the promised blessings. Blessings have not always come in material ways, but blessings have truly come. The principle always works. I have heard testimonies to this truth, and I know of myself the principle is true. Do you think that I would teach you those principles if I did not know that they were true? They will be fulfilled in your behalf. I want to see your lives blessed by observance of these principles.</p>
<p>The law of the Sabbath also illustrates this principle.</p>
<p>[Note the purpose of the Sabbath day:] <i>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world,</i> [is there anyone who does not want to do that?] <i>thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day</i> [a sacrament is a spiritual covenant];</p>
<p><i>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High.</i></p>
<p>To “rest from your labors,” you stop the regular weekly routine in order to have time to do the work of the Lord and to worship the Lord on the Sabbath day. Note the promise if we do so.</p>
<p><i>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this,</i> the fullness of the earth is yours . . .</p>
<p><i>And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; . . .</i></p>
<p><i>But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.</i> [D&amp;C 59:9–10, 16, 20, 23; emphasis added]</p>
<p>Do you want to miss this promise? All mankind is seeking for peace. Yet peace—inner peace—and eternal life are within your grasp if you will but reach out and claim them by doing the works of righteousness.</p>
<p>(I hope that sometime your great president will share with you his university experience—the pressures to study on the Sabbath day, his refusal to do it, and his testimony of how the Lord fulfills His promises.)</p>
<p>Finally, I would suggest an additional dimension to your relationship to law. The Lord expects you to pursue righteousness.</p>
<p><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i></p>
<p><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i></p>
<p><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i></p>
<p><i>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</i></p>
<p><i>Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that obeys not my commandments?</i></p>
<p><i>Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled.</i></p>
<p><i>I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.</i></p>
<p><i>Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled. But, wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.</i> [D&amp;C 58:26–33]</p>
<p>The Lord has given you this earthly experience. He has established laws to guide you. He has promised blessings for obedience. He wants you to return to live with him. Like the crew of Apollo 13, you cannot get “home” without direction from heaven. Like them, you may be oblivious to a hurricane boiling toward your splash-down area. Were you not guided by revelation from God, you could easily lose contact, wander off your course, and find yourself in outer darkness where you must drift eternally. If, however, you will listen to and follow divine direction, you can gain eternal life.</p>
<p>I testify that our Heavenly Father lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, and our Redeemer. President Kimball is his living prophet. Your safeguard on your journey through life is the constant direction from a wise and loving Heavenly Father. With all my heart I plead with you to listen, to obey, and to live. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">SGS: We are so grateful for the blessing of being with you this morning as we begin winter semester. We like the new beginnings, new routines, and new opportunities that are part of this time of year. We are glad all of you are with us. We are also happy for those who have chosen to begin their missionary service with the recent announcement made by President Monson.
COS: During general conference this past October, we were very interested in the many references, both direct and indirect, that assured us of the continued influence of heaven in our lives. We believe this is true for us individually, for us as a Church, and also for us as the BYU community. Lest any be confused or misled, I am not suggesting that our agency is compromised or limited. In fact, our agency or responsibility to make proper choices is a fundamental and inescapable doctrine of our Heavenly Father’s plan. Likewise, it is also essential we understand that in our mortal probation we are entitled to have the interventions of “the hand of the Lord” in our lives when we live so as to merit such blessings.
Usually, at least in our experience, the touch of the Lord’s hand is soft and subtle—so soft and subtle that we may not recognize it. Happily, in necessary situations our experience can be as that of Ezekiel when he said, “The hand of the Lord was strong upon me” (Ezekiel 3:14).
SGS: What is increasingly clear to us is that as we reflect on what has transpired in our lifetimes and in yours, we have been influenced more than we previously imagined by the blessings and guidance available to us in answer to our prayers. How this happens occurs in multiple ways. We believe in the scriptural assurances of the ministering of angels. We also know that the Holy Ghost has a tremendous influence in our lives when we live so that such help is appropriate. We also understand better as we get older that often the help we need is provided by our loving Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior, through other people who have been prompted to help, guide, and rescue us in times of need or consequential decision making.
COS: As President Henry B. Eyring recounted the special events that led him to surrender his tenured faculty appointment at Stanford University and took him to preside at Ricks College (see “Where Is the Pavilion?” Ensign, November 2012, 72–75), we have reflected on our own experiences. In some ways what has happened to us is very different and in other ways is exactly the same as has unfolded for others. A common characteristic in our case seems to be that we recognize the hand of the Lord much better in retrospect than while interventions are actually taking place. Another is that the Lord’s hand often is so gentle that what happens seems to be usual in the normal course of current events but later turns out to be of very great import. Likewise, when we have not been careful to acknow</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">After recovering from the shock of being invited early last November to speak at today’s devotional, my mind turned to finding a topic on which to speak. The invitation was to address a gospel topic of importance to me. The idea of gospel gifts came quickly to mind. We were entering the holiday season, a season of gratitude for gifts and blessings received as well as a season for the giving of gifts. A bit more thought reminded me that I would be speaking one day before my youngest daughter’s 15th birthday and, as we know, birthdays are also occasions for gift giving.
Subsequent pondering and prayer confirmed that my initial impression to speak about gospel gifts was appropriate. The idea of gifts permeates the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the most recent general conference of the Church, 11 of the 34 talks included the word gift or gifts. Additionally, 129 chapters or sections of the standard works make reference to gifts.
Gospel Gifts Typify Jesus Christ
So what do I mean by gospel gifts? As the Bible Dictionary in the LDS edition of the scriptures tells us, “The word gospel means good news. The good news is that Jesus Christ has made a perfect atonement for mankind” (s.v. “gospels,” 682). While preparing this talk, I read the following verse during my regular scripture study:
Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.[2 Nephi 11:4]
The phrase gospel gifts came to me weeks before I read this passage, but only upon reading it did I understand more fully. Gospel gifts are gifts that point us to or typify Jesus Christ.
Gospel Gifts May Be Given to Us By God
One of the scriptural references to gifts is found in Matthew 7:9–11, which reads:
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
In these verses, the Savior teaches us that even we imperfect mortals know how to give good gifts. That being the case, it ought to cause no wonderment in us that, in their perfection, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ also give good, even perfect, gifts. However, the 129 scriptural passages I referred to either address gifts in general or they do not make clear what specific gift is being given.
Gifts are given—indeed, the dictionary suggests that the word gift is akin to the Old English giefan, which means “to give.” Therefore, I searched for the word give and its variants in the online version of the scrip</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a privilege to stand before you at this podium today. This is not an occasion that I anticipated or aspired to, but it is indeed a privilege, and I welcome the opportunity to share my testimony of the Savior and some things I have learned about being His disciple.
On April 8, 2008, I noted, as I always do on that date, the anniversary of my appointment as a faculty member here at BYU, beginning 34 years ago on April 8, 1974. I was not among the original group of faculty hired for what was then the new J. Reuben Clark Law School, but I was the first of the “non-originals,” and now, with the passage of time, have become the longest continuously serving member of the Law School faculty. I am profoundly grateful for the many students and colleagues—both at the Law School and the university generally—who have enriched my life.
I first became a student of the law at Duke University School of Law in September 1967—nearly 41 years ago. Only four years earlier I had received my patriarchal blessing, which included the admonition “Study the laws of the temporal affairs of men as well as of their spiritual affairs.” I began teaching here at the BYU Law School less than two years after completing law studies at Duke, and when I reread this patriarchal blessing a few years ago, I realized that most of my legal career had indeed centered on the “study” of the law.
My remarks today will touch on the laws of our temporal affairs as well as on the laws of our spiritual affairs. Our scriptures contain dozens of references to both temporal and spiritual laws. The Lord declared “that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given you a law which was temporal” (D&amp;C 29:34). Joseph Smith was urged by the Lord “to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion” (D&amp;C 93:53). And to all of us the Lord commanded: “Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land” (D&amp;C 58:21). And thus we proclaim in the twelfth article of faith our commitment to “obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.”
The great prophet Lehi taught us that without the law of God there would be no sin, righteousness, happiness, punishment, or misery: “And if these things are not there is no God” (2 Nephi 2:13). Alma affirmed this by teaching:
There is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God. [Alma 42:22]
Whatever else we learn from these scriptures, we learn that one of the important godly attributes is adherence to law.
However, it is important to realize that the law is not only </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What a privilege it is to speak to you, a royal generation, who were chosen before the foundation of the world to come forth at this time to do an important work. I have met many of you during my service in the Church, and I have been impressed by your brightness and goodness. I can picture you now in your gatherings all over the world, from the United States, Mexico, Brazil, and other countries in South America to the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and many European countries. I have even seen you arrive at meetings by the truckload in the Dominican Republic.
We learn in the Book of Mormon that when the rising generation—that’s you—are converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ and keep their covenants, then the future is bright for all of the Lord’s people. But when the rising generation fails to gain testimonies and take hold of their responsibilities, then the older, more faithful people begin to lose heart (see Mosiah 26:1–4; see also 1 Nephi 8:23). Thank you for your fine lives and the bright future you will bring to me and so many others.
We are here tonight primarily because we have a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Without that testimony there would be no point in going any further with a message to you. I know that you have a firm belief in our Heavenly Father and in the Savior and in latter-day prophets or you would not have made the effort to attend this meeting. When we know the restored gospel is true, we embrace all of it and not just the parts that are convenient for us. We believe in the plan of our Heavenly Father and all that the prophets and apostles have taught us. I know that as you participate tonight with an open and prayerful heart, the Spirit will convey to each of you some individualized and important teachings.
As I pondered and prayed to the Lord to learn what He would have me say to you tonight, my thoughts went often to my 79 nieces and nephews. I have walked with them, sung with them, and heard their testimonies. I love them all. I know that each one of them has desires to make a difference for good in the world and have their lives count for something. Twenty-two of those 79 nieces and nephews are single adults in your age-group. Of those 22, 11 of them are currently serving or have served missions, and others are preparing for missions. Some are preparing for marriage. Some have completed school and are searching for their place in the world. All of them have been or are currently furthering their education.
These nieces and nephews have unique gifts, and among them are those who have had experience with illness, injury, and tragedy. Knowing that in many ways my nieces and nephews are representative of you, I prepared this message with them in mind. In thinking of them, I think of you. Each of you has been, is, or will be in the same places as these nieces and nephews. I have sought inspiration as to how I could be of help to them with some of their questions, </span>
