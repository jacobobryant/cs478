  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="This is a wonderful time to be a student at Brigham Young University - no matter what &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated &lt;/i&gt;says. In fact, its a wonderful time to be a college student anywhere. I am so impressed with the opportunities and privileges that are yours as young adult members of the Church. Never before have young people had so many options available to them, whether youre talking about worldwide travel, higher education, or the opportunity to render meaningful and life-changing service to others.

As freedom continues to spread throughout the world and the message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ rolls forth, great opportunities present themselves to those who are prepared to make a significant contribution. I commend you and congratulate you for preparing yourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are ahead of you.

I dont need to tell you that life includes some problems for everyone - whether single, married, or somewhere in between. You should know that the Brethren are aware of some of your challenges. We discuss often the difficulties that young adult members of the Church are facing, and we pray for you. We keep you in our minds and hearts as we formulate policies and programs that affect the young adults of the Church. You must remember that even though the General Authorities may seem old to you, we stay young at heart because we have children and grandchildren who share their concerns with us. We also have auxiliary general boards and your own ward and stake leaders who keep us well informed of your problems and challenges.

You are our future, and you must be prepared. You are the future leaders of the Church, of government, and of business, and of the professions. Most important, you will be leading your families into the most exciting and, perhaps, most critical time in the history of the Church and of the world.

This evening, I wish to speak about your future. I pray that I may help you in your preparation for the unique role that each one of you ultimately will play. Have you ever watched a large ship weigh its anchor? It is fascinating to see and hear the massive links of chain screeching against the metal bow of the ship as the anchor is lowered or raised. Now, the metal shanks of the anchor chain are incredibly heavy, but their weight is slight when compared to the total weight of the ship. Still, if an anchor is placed properly on the bottom of the sea, it can hold a giant ship fast, even in rough seas.

Just as ships need anchors to keep them from drifting away on the open seas, people need spiritual anchors in their lives if they are to remain steadfast and not drift into the sea of temptation and sin. Faith in God and in his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the main anchor we must have in our lives to hold us fast during times of social turbulence and wickedness that seem to be everywhere today. This faith must be more than that of the generic dictionary variety. Our faith, for it to be meaningful and effective and to hold us fast, must be centered in Jesus Christ, in his life, in his atonement, and in the restoration of his gospel to the earth in the last days.

Recently I spoke to a group of prospective missionaries. Many of those young men and women had made the decision to serve a full-time mission, but others were not certain they should accept a call to serve. I told them that they did not have to decide that night whether or not to go on a mission. But I said they did need to decide whether or not Joseph Smith knelt in the presence of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, "on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty." Listen to Josephs own words:

&lt;i&gt;After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction - not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being - just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other - This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! &lt;/i&gt;[JS-H 1:1417]

If this happened to Joseph, then the question of whether or not these prospective missionaries should serve a mission or whether or not they should keep the Lords commandments faithfully, pretty well takes care of itself, doesnt it? If anyone knows, I mean really knows, that Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to and spoke to Joseph Smith as he said they did, the natural outcome of that knowledge should kindle a strong desire to serve God and his Holy Son all the days of his or her life.

Nothing is more remarkable or important in this life than to know that God our Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, have spoken again from the heavens and have called prophets and apostles to teach the fullness of the everlasting gospel once again upon the earth. That is a glorious thing to know. When you know it, that knowledge affects your life. It influences every major decision you make. It changes the course of your life to a safer one because it provides an anchor that helps hold you fast to the teachings of the gospel despite the evil influences all around you that entice you to drift toward sin and transgression.

I make the same argument for the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood through John the Baptist and the Melchizedek Priesthood through Peter, James, and John. Lets be very plain about this. Either the priesthood of God has been restored or it has not. When you know that it has, you have secured your spiritual anchor even more firmly against the turbulence and storms of life.

Similarly, either the Book of Mormon is the word of God and is another testament of Jesus Christ or it is not. Either it is the record of the Lords dealings with the people on the American continent from 600 B.C. to A.D. 421 or it is not. Either it is a translation from gold plates completed by Joseph Smith under divine guidance or it is not. The issue is that simple and that profound. If the Book of Mormon is, in fact, the word of God, as I testify that it is, then the question of whether or not we should apply its principles and teachings in our own lives is already decided, isnt it?

The same simple test applies to our living prophets and apostles today. President Ezra Taft Benson is either a prophet of God in every sense, in every way, or he is not.

My dear brothers and sisters, it really is no more complicated than that. If we know these things to be true, we really have no question about how we should live and what we should do with our lives. If we know that we are anchored to "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth," our course is clear (see D&amp;amp;C 1:30). What a marvelous blessing to know this.

You know how to find out for yourselves if these things are true because you understand the first principles of the gospel. Because you have an anchor of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you understand that you must pray to receive your personal testimony. You understand that the Holy Ghost "shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26). When you know and live these simple truths, they will be a spiritual anchor to help you keep your own life from being "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine" (Ephesians 4:14).

Becoming firmly grounded to these simple truths and focusing your attention on the lessons of eternity will keep your life moving in the right direction at all times and in all situations, regardless of which way the winds of current worldly trends may be blowing.

Ella Wheeler Wilcox made this observation while she was a passenger on a steamship and noticed that one ship went west and another east in the same wind:

&lt;i&gt;One ship drives east and another drives west &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;With the self-same winds that blow;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tis the set of the sails&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And not the gales&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That tells them the way to go.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Like the winds of the sea are the winds of fate &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As we voyage along through life;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tis the set of the soul&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That decides its goal&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And not the calm or the strife.&lt;/i&gt;
["The Winds of Fate," by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in &lt;i&gt;World Voices &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Hearsts International Library Company, 1916), p. 51]

Many of you are just starting another school year and are working toward degrees in a variety of disciplines: the arts, science, medicine, law, humanities, business, language, engineering, and computers, for example. These ambitions and goals are praiseworthy and admirable and, when you graduate, will put you in a position to do much good in the world. But the most important knowledge you can acquire, and the area of learning that will keep everything else in focus for you and bring you true happiness and joy, will be your solid anchor of assurance that you are a true disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The word &lt;i&gt;disciple &lt;/i&gt;comes from the Latin word &lt;i&gt;discipulus; &lt;/i&gt;it means to learn or to know. Many people think that being a disciple means simply to follow, with an unfortunate connotation of following blindly. Becoming a true disciple is nothing of the sort! It requires us to learn and to know of Jesus Christ, to study the principles of truth for ourselves and to receive answers - in other words, to receive knowledge. Because President Benson knows this, he has called upon Church members to study the scriptures every day. Once we have knowledge of the simple principles of the Restoration, coupled with a deep and abiding faith in the truths we do not yet know, we become true disciples of Jesus Christ and not simply followers. The difference between a disciple and a follower is like the difference between a ships anchor that is lodged solidly at the bottom of the sea, holding the ship fast, and an anchor that is merely suspended in water because the chain is too short. Such an anchor may appear to be doing its job when the seas are calm, but serves no purpose during storms or high waves. Remem-ber these words from the prophet Nephi:

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Nephi 31:20]

Every great prophet - including those in the Old Testament, the New Testament, or the Book of Mormon - has had to go through the process of becoming a true disciple by coming to an unshakable knowledge of Christ. Each one has had to ask himself, just as I have asked you to ask yourselves tonight, "Is Jesus Christ the Son of God, our Eternal Father?" "Does he live and does he preside over his Church today?"

The sure knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the World provided the courage for Meshach, Shadrach, and Abed-nego to enter a fiery furnace without fear. Abinadis knowledge of Christ gave him the power to testify of Christ while being burned to death by the wicked priests of King Noah. The same knowledge that Christ lives gave Nephi the power to endure the incessant insults of his brothers and gave him the strength to suffer until his brothers broke the strong cords that held him bound during a tumultuous storm at sea. Having come to know Christ, Elijah had the power to literally command fire to consume his soggy altar while the priests of Baal watched in awe. An absolute conviction that Jesus Christ is the Messiah gave Samuel the Lamanite the courage to stand on the city wall and bear testimony to the wicked Nephites and to receive protection from their arrows and stones. The brother of Jared was even able to move the mountain Zerin because he knew in his heart of hearts that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God! The scriptures are filled with righteous acts and testimonies of men and women who care to know for themselves that Jesus is the Christ.

That same sure testimony of Jesus can be yours because the gospel has been restored in its fullness in the last days. Testimony and knowledge come as a result of your personal faith and prayers. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with faith and courage, and he will help you endure any challenges you may face. He will help you overcome loneliness, feelings of desperation and hopelessness, setbacks of a personal, emotional, financial, and even spiritual nature. He will strengthen you when you are simply feeling overwhelmed by all of the demands for your time and attention. He will give you the ability to serve faithfully in every assignment you receive from your local Church leaders. Your faith and your knowledge of the restoration of the gospel will give you the strength to be faithful and true to the covenants you have made with the Lord and to share your strengths and talents gladly to build up the kingdom of God here on the earth.

Brothers and sisters, your testimony of Jesus Christ is the most important anchor that you can have to help hold you steadfast and immovable to principles of righteousness, regardless of the challenges and temptations that may come in the future.

The Book of Mormon prophet Ether explained this principle to the people of his day. From the twelfth chapter of Ether we read:

[Ether] &lt;i&gt;could not be restrained because of the Spirit of the Lord which was in him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance lest they should be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all things are fulfilled - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, &lt;/i&gt;maketh an anchor to the souls of men, &lt;i&gt;which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God. &lt;/i&gt;[Ether 12:24; emphasis added]

The principle is clear. We believe, we hope, we have faith, we act upon that faith by "abounding in good works," and we have an attitude of glorifying God. Then we shall, indeed, have a place at the right hand of God.

Now lets step back and take a look at this from a little broader perspective. As each of you receives the education and the degree for which you are working and becomes successful in your chosen field of endeavor, whether within or outside of the home - all the while remaining disciples of Christ - think what a light you will be for those around you. Many are lost because they do not have a spiritual anchor of any kind to hold them secure when buffeted by the worldly waves and wind. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (&lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt;pp. 14546).

Those of our Fathers children who know that through Joseph Smith the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored are most blessed. With this precious knowledge comes a duty to prepare ourselves spiritually to serve God and our fellowmen.

My beloved brothers and sisters, please understand that the future of the Church will be yours and that you must do your part to help people turn their hearts to God. You can be the antidote to much of the moral decline in America and the world! You who have testimonies of the restored gospel, you who know the true nature of God, you who have the light of the Holy Ghost within you can be a spiritual lighthouse to the people of the world. You can be like a life preserver that people who are drowning in their own spiritual ignorance can grasp and cling to until they find safety within their own testimonies of Christ.

We know that we cannot look to the government, to the Church, or even to our own families to save us because we can be saved ultimately only through our own individual good works and our own testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Creator of the Universe, and that his gospel has been restored through Joseph Smith with the priesthood and the ordinances that will provide eternal life to the faithful.

A fervent personal testimony of Christ and his Church often comes in simple ways. From my own experiences, I can testify of this. I accepted a call to go to England on a mission when I was nineteen. Because of my missionary experience, I became anchored to a testimony of the reality of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I stood in Hyde Park and on many other street corners in the British Isles and bore my testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, that the gospel had been restored in its fullness, and that the priesthood and authority to bless mankind is once again upon the earth. The more I bore my testimony, the more it became a part of me.

After I returned home, my testimony gave me the direction and the faith I needed to find the girl of my dreams, who would support me in my Church callings and in all my duties and help me live the teachings of the gospel. My sweetheart of over forty-one years, Barbara, is here with me tonight, and I publicly thank the Lord for her.

My understanding of the gospel has given me guidance on the kind of father and now grandfather I should be. My testimony, gained in my youth, has helped me respond to every call in the Church, including this current overwhelming call to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. My testimony, obtained a long time ago on the street corners of England, has grown line upon line and precept upon precept until I can stand before you tonight, my dear young friends, and testify as a special witness of the Lord Jesus Christ that our Savior lives and he is the Son of God our Eternal Father. My life has never been the same since I anchored my soul to the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.

Now, brothers and sisters, lets return for a moment to the analogy of the ships anchor, especially the massive anchor chain. Suppose a beautiful sailing ship had been manufactured from the finest materials and had been reinforced and strengthened for the roughest seas. The mast and sails had been prepared carefully and were sturdy and seaworthy. Suppose the anchor was above standard in size and weight and craftsmanship. But, suppose, by some inadvertent error, the chain attached to the anchor was inferior and weak. Visualize what would happen the first time the anchor was lowered, or the first time a strong wave tried to push the anchored ship out to sea. If any link of the chain holding the anchor broke, the anchor would be left to rust on the bottom of the ocean floor and the ship would drift and perhaps be destroyed.

The comparison to our lives is plain. The links in our chain of faith and testimony that enable our personal anchor to keep us safe and secure are the simple doctrines and teachings of the gospel. For example, can you see the value of the gospel link of personal prayer? Those of you who are single can kneel in a quiet and private place and pray for guidance before you leave your home and after you return each day. If you are married, you can join hands with your spouse and take turns offering companion prayers. Thanking your Heavenly Father for your blessings will help you remain secure. Pray for the help you need in your personal life, your education, your career, and your relationships. You students must know that the Lord will help you understand calculus and economics as surely as he will help you understand the principles of the gospel if you ask him after doing all that you can on your own.

Can you see another gospel link in your chain being the Word of Wisdom? By faithfully living the Lords law of health, that link in the chain will help you keep your physical bodies strong. At the same time, you "shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" that will help you be more committed to the Church (see D&amp;amp;C 89:19).

Another link is the law of tithing. You understand, I believe, that paying a full tithe is not a matter of money; it is a matter of faith. You can pay a full tithe regardless of your income if you develop the faith to do so. The Lord surely will "open the windows of heaven" as he has promised to those who are obedient to this commandment (see Malachi 3:10 and 3 Nephi 24:10).

How about the links of honesty, moral purity, service to others, attendance at Church meetings, and studying the scriptures, to name just a few? These links of your gospel anchor chain may seem somewhat elementary, but they are as important as the anchor of faith and testimony itself. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. We must take care every day to examine our own personal chain to anchor our souls to the gospel and see if we have any weak links that may make us vulnerable to the influences of the devil.

One good way to keep every link strong is to partake of the sacrament each week. As you know, the sacrament is a renewal and a reminder of all our covenants with the Lord. What a great time for personal introspection and reflection on our life during the past week. Make the sacrament a time to review your personal gospel chain and see if each link is equal to the task of anchoring you securely to the Church.

Last of all, for those of you who have been temple endowed, doing temple work will keep this link strong. The temple is the house of the Lord. Take the time to go as often as you can to feel the presence of Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.

My dear young brothers and sisters, your personal chain that anchors your soul to the gospel can be as strong as you want to make it through a daily review of your life. Be grateful for the principle of repentance, which provides the way for us to strengthen any weak links in our personal chain. Be worthy and at peace within yourself. If you know that you are anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ but still feel like lifes trials are more than you can handle, find peace and strength in the knowledge that each day you have done the best you can in honoring the Lord. Remember that strengthening your testimony is a lifelong process. Never become discouraged and overwhelmed. Look to the Lord for strength to overcome discouragement and hopelessness. Work on one link at a time and strengthen each until you can feel anchored safely and securely to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

I am reminded of what Helaman said to his sons, Nephi and Lehi, some thirty years before Christ was born:

&lt;i&gt;And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 5:12]

My dear brothers and sisters, we cannot fall if we are anchored securely to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and if we forge strong links in an anchor chain that will hold us fast to the sure and simple principles of the gospel.

Repentance is a great blessing that our Father has given to us. Use it if you need to. And I promise you, in the name of the Lord, that as you honestly deal with yourself in those quiet moments and resolve to strengthen any link in your gospel anchor chain that needs your attention, you will find that strength.

Now, in closing, I think many of you who are here in the Marriott Center and in the stake centers hearing our broadcast feel it would sure be nice to get to the point where Brother Ballard is where you dont have any worries. Let me tell you, and put your mind at ease, at least about this apostle. I better not speak for all of my associates. Weve all had our challenges. Ive certainly had mine. Ive had my challenges and disappointments. Ive had those moments of feeling somewhat desperate - when I was in business and decisions seemed to go against me, and I wondered why. Ive had health struggles, as perhaps many of you have. But all of the challenges, if we handle them right, staying solidly anchored to the Master, we can manage.

Years ago I took a young man to meet President Kimball. He said he had given up hope, that he didnt believe there was a God anymore because his mother had passed away with cancer. He loved his mother, and he said to the president, "If there really was a God, he never would have let my mother suffer and die as she did."

Then President Kimball, in that wonderful sweet way of his, put his hands on the shoulders of my nineteen-year-old friend and said, "My boy, your mother is all right. Sit down, and lets talk about you."

Then he taught him in a beautiful way. One of the things he taught that I shall never forget ties to this matter of strengthening your anchor chain. He said, "My boy, Ive had a lot of health challenges. I had cancer of the throat. Ive had my body opened from here to here with open-heart surgery in my mid-seventies. Ive had all kinds of challenges healthwise." Then he looked at my friend and at me and said, "And through my suffering I have come to know God."

My beloved young brothers and sisters, you do face and will face challenges. You did not come here thinking that you were going to pass through this experience without difficulties and challenge. I promise you in the name of the Lord, and bless you, by and through the holy apostleship invested in me, if you will remain unwaveringly anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ and devote your heart and soul to him, and if youve made mistakes if you will come unto him and give away your sins through the principle of repentance and commit to serve him and honor him all the days of your life, you will be blessed and all of the promises of the eternities will be given unto you. That I know.

How grateful we are for every one of you. You are precious to the Church. You are precious to your families. You are precious to the countries of your origins.

I invoke a blessing also that you may have strength come to you now, that as you study at whatever university you are attending you will prepare yourselves to take up the labors of the sons and daughters of God who know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he has restored the church and kingdom of God to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.

With that knowledge, my beloved young friends, go forward now, bless this great world that you live in. Bless your associates. Bless your families. And may all of the peace and joy and happiness be yours because of your faithfulness, I humbly pray in the sacred and beloved name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>This is a wonderful time to be a student at Brigham Young University - no matter what <i>Sports Illustrated </i>says. In fact, its a wonderful time to be a college student anywhere. I am so impressed with the opportunities and privileges that are yours as young adult members of the Church. Never before have young people had so many options available to them, whether youre talking about worldwide travel, higher education, or the opportunity to render meaningful and life-changing service to others.</p>
<p>As freedom continues to spread throughout the world and the message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ rolls forth, great opportunities present themselves to those who are prepared to make a significant contribution. I commend you and congratulate you for preparing yourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are ahead of you.</p>
<p>I dont need to tell you that life includes some problems for everyone - whether single, married, or somewhere in between. You should know that the Brethren are aware of some of your challenges. We discuss often the difficulties that young adult members of the Church are facing, and we pray for you. We keep you in our minds and hearts as we formulate policies and programs that affect the young adults of the Church. You must remember that even though the General Authorities may seem old to you, we stay young at heart because we have children and grandchildren who share their concerns with us. We also have auxiliary general boards and your own ward and stake leaders who keep us well informed of your problems and challenges.</p>
<p>You are our future, and you must be prepared. You are the future leaders of the Church, of government, and of business, and of the professions. Most important, you will be leading your families into the most exciting and, perhaps, most critical time in the history of the Church and of the world.</p>
<p>This evening, I wish to speak about your future. I pray that I may help you in your preparation for the unique role that each one of you ultimately will play. Have you ever watched a large ship weigh its anchor? It is fascinating to see and hear the massive links of chain screeching against the metal bow of the ship as the anchor is lowered or raised. Now, the metal shanks of the anchor chain are incredibly heavy, but their weight is slight when compared to the total weight of the ship. Still, if an anchor is placed properly on the bottom of the sea, it can hold a giant ship fast, even in rough seas.</p>
<p>Just as ships need anchors to keep them from drifting away on the open seas, people need spiritual anchors in their lives if they are to remain steadfast and not drift into the sea of temptation and sin. Faith in God and in his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the main anchor we must have in our lives to hold us fast during times of social turbulence and wickedness that seem to be everywhere today. This faith must be more than that of the generic dictionary variety. Our faith, for it to be meaningful and effective and to hold us fast, must be centered in Jesus Christ, in his life, in his atonement, and in the restoration of his gospel to the earth in the last days.</p>
<p>Recently I spoke to a group of prospective missionaries. Many of those young men and women had made the decision to serve a full-time mission, but others were not certain they should accept a call to serve. I told them that they did not have to decide that night whether or not to go on a mission. But I said they did need to decide whether or not Joseph Smith knelt in the presence of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, "on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty." Listen to Josephs own words:</p>
<p><i>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.</i></p>
<p><i>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction - not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being - just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i></p>
<p><i>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other - This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! </i>[JS-H 1:1417]</p>
<p>If this happened to Joseph, then the question of whether or not these prospective missionaries should serve a mission or whether or not they should keep the Lords commandments faithfully, pretty well takes care of itself, doesnt it? If anyone knows, I mean really knows, that Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to and spoke to Joseph Smith as he said they did, the natural outcome of that knowledge should kindle a strong desire to serve God and his Holy Son all the days of his or her life.</p>
<p>Nothing is more remarkable or important in this life than to know that God our Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, have spoken again from the heavens and have called prophets and apostles to teach the fullness of the everlasting gospel once again upon the earth. That is a glorious thing to know. When you know it, that knowledge affects your life. It influences every major decision you make. It changes the course of your life to a safer one because it provides an anchor that helps hold you fast to the teachings of the gospel despite the evil influences all around you that entice you to drift toward sin and transgression.</p>
<p>I make the same argument for the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood through John the Baptist and the Melchizedek Priesthood through Peter, James, and John. Lets be very plain about this. Either the priesthood of God has been restored or it has not. When you know that it has, you have secured your spiritual anchor even more firmly against the turbulence and storms of life.</p>
<p>Similarly, either the Book of Mormon is the word of God and is another testament of Jesus Christ or it is not. Either it is the record of the Lords dealings with the people on the American continent from 600 B.C. to A.D. 421 or it is not. Either it is a translation from gold plates completed by Joseph Smith under divine guidance or it is not. The issue is that simple and that profound. If the Book of Mormon is, in fact, the word of God, as I testify that it is, then the question of whether or not we should apply its principles and teachings in our own lives is already decided, isnt it?</p>
<p>The same simple test applies to our living prophets and apostles today. President Ezra Taft Benson is either a prophet of God in every sense, in every way, or he is not.</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, it really is no more complicated than that. If we know these things to be true, we really have no question about how we should live and what we should do with our lives. If we know that we are anchored to "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth," our course is clear (see D&amp;C 1:30). What a marvelous blessing to know this.</p>
<p>You know how to find out for yourselves if these things are true because you understand the first principles of the gospel. Because you have an anchor of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you understand that you must pray to receive your personal testimony. You understand that the Holy Ghost "shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26). When you know and live these simple truths, they will be a spiritual anchor to help you keep your own life from being "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine" (Ephesians 4:14).</p>
<p>Becoming firmly grounded to these simple truths and focusing your attention on the lessons of eternity will keep your life moving in the right direction at all times and in all situations, regardless of which way the winds of current worldly trends may be blowing.</p>
<p>Ella Wheeler Wilcox made this observation while she was a passenger on a steamship and noticed that one ship went west and another east in the same wind:</p>
<p><i>One ship drives east and another drives west </i><br />
<i>With the self-same winds that blow;</i><br />
<i>Tis the set of the sails</i><br />
<i>And not the gales</i><br />
<i>That tells them the way to go.</i></p>
<p><i>Like the winds of the sea are the winds of fate </i><br />
<i>As we voyage along through life;</i><br />
<i>Tis the set of the soul</i><br />
<i>That decides its goal</i><br />
<i>And not the calm or the strife.</i><br />
["The Winds of Fate," by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in <i>World Voices </i>(New York: Hearsts International Library Company, 1916), p. 51]</p>
<p>Many of you are just starting another school year and are working toward degrees in a variety of disciplines: the arts, science, medicine, law, humanities, business, language, engineering, and computers, for example. These ambitions and goals are praiseworthy and admirable and, when you graduate, will put you in a position to do much good in the world. But the most important knowledge you can acquire, and the area of learning that will keep everything else in focus for you and bring you true happiness and joy, will be your solid anchor of assurance that you are a true disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The word <i>disciple </i>comes from the Latin word <i>discipulus; </i>it means to learn or to know. Many people think that being a disciple means simply to follow, with an unfortunate connotation of following blindly. Becoming a true disciple is nothing of the sort! It requires us to learn and to know of Jesus Christ, to study the principles of truth for ourselves and to receive answers - in other words, to receive knowledge. Because President Benson knows this, he has called upon Church members to study the scriptures every day. Once we have knowledge of the simple principles of the Restoration, coupled with a deep and abiding faith in the truths we do not yet know, we become true disciples of Jesus Christ and not simply followers. The difference between a disciple and a follower is like the difference between a ships anchor that is lodged solidly at the bottom of the sea, holding the ship fast, and an anchor that is merely suspended in water because the chain is too short. Such an anchor may appear to be doing its job when the seas are calm, but serves no purpose during storms or high waves. Remem-ber these words from the prophet Nephi:</p>
<p><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life. </i>[2 Nephi 31:20]</p>
<p>Every great prophet - including those in the Old Testament, the New Testament, or the Book of Mormon - has had to go through the process of becoming a true disciple by coming to an unshakable knowledge of Christ. Each one has had to ask himself, just as I have asked you to ask yourselves tonight, "Is Jesus Christ the Son of God, our Eternal Father?" "Does he live and does he preside over his Church today?"</p>
<p>The sure knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the World provided the courage for Meshach, Shadrach, and Abed-nego to enter a fiery furnace without fear. Abinadis knowledge of Christ gave him the power to testify of Christ while being burned to death by the wicked priests of King Noah. The same knowledge that Christ lives gave Nephi the power to endure the incessant insults of his brothers and gave him the strength to suffer until his brothers broke the strong cords that held him bound during a tumultuous storm at sea. Having come to know Christ, Elijah had the power to literally command fire to consume his soggy altar while the priests of Baal watched in awe. An absolute conviction that Jesus Christ is the Messiah gave Samuel the Lamanite the courage to stand on the city wall and bear testimony to the wicked Nephites and to receive protection from their arrows and stones. The brother of Jared was even able to move the mountain Zerin because he knew in his heart of hearts that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God! The scriptures are filled with righteous acts and testimonies of men and women who care to know for themselves that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
<p>That same sure testimony of Jesus can be yours because the gospel has been restored in its fullness in the last days. Testimony and knowledge come as a result of your personal faith and prayers. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with faith and courage, and he will help you endure any challenges you may face. He will help you overcome loneliness, feelings of desperation and hopelessness, setbacks of a personal, emotional, financial, and even spiritual nature. He will strengthen you when you are simply feeling overwhelmed by all of the demands for your time and attention. He will give you the ability to serve faithfully in every assignment you receive from your local Church leaders. Your faith and your knowledge of the restoration of the gospel will give you the strength to be faithful and true to the covenants you have made with the Lord and to share your strengths and talents gladly to build up the kingdom of God here on the earth.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, your testimony of Jesus Christ is the most important anchor that you can have to help hold you steadfast and immovable to principles of righteousness, regardless of the challenges and temptations that may come in the future.</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon prophet Ether explained this principle to the people of his day. From the twelfth chapter of Ether we read:</p>
<p>[Ether] <i>could not be restrained because of the Spirit of the Lord which was in him.</i></p>
<p><i>For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance lest they should be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all things are fulfilled - </i></p>
<p><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, </i>maketh an anchor to the souls of men, <i>which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God. </i>[Ether 12:24; emphasis added]</p>
<p>The principle is clear. We believe, we hope, we have faith, we act upon that faith by "abounding in good works," and we have an attitude of glorifying God. Then we shall, indeed, have a place at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>Now lets step back and take a look at this from a little broader perspective. As each of you receives the education and the degree for which you are working and becomes successful in your chosen field of endeavor, whether within or outside of the home - all the while remaining disciples of Christ - think what a light you will be for those around you. Many are lost because they do not have a spiritual anchor of any kind to hold them secure when buffeted by the worldly waves and wind. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 14546).</p>
<p>Those of our Fathers children who know that through Joseph Smith the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored are most blessed. With this precious knowledge comes a duty to prepare ourselves spiritually to serve God and our fellowmen.</p>
<p>My beloved brothers and sisters, please understand that the future of the Church will be yours and that you must do your part to help people turn their hearts to God. You can be the antidote to much of the moral decline in America and the world! You who have testimonies of the restored gospel, you who know the true nature of God, you who have the light of the Holy Ghost within you can be a spiritual lighthouse to the people of the world. You can be like a life preserver that people who are drowning in their own spiritual ignorance can grasp and cling to until they find safety within their own testimonies of Christ.</p>
<p>We know that we cannot look to the government, to the Church, or even to our own families to save us because we can be saved ultimately only through our own individual good works and our own testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Creator of the Universe, and that his gospel has been restored through Joseph Smith with the priesthood and the ordinances that will provide eternal life to the faithful.</p>
<p>A fervent personal testimony of Christ and his Church often comes in simple ways. From my own experiences, I can testify of this. I accepted a call to go to England on a mission when I was nineteen. Because of my missionary experience, I became anchored to a testimony of the reality of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I stood in Hyde Park and on many other street corners in the British Isles and bore my testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, that the gospel had been restored in its fullness, and that the priesthood and authority to bless mankind is once again upon the earth. The more I bore my testimony, the more it became a part of me.</p>
<p>After I returned home, my testimony gave me the direction and the faith I needed to find the girl of my dreams, who would support me in my Church callings and in all my duties and help me live the teachings of the gospel. My sweetheart of over forty-one years, Barbara, is here with me tonight, and I publicly thank the Lord for her.</p>
<p>My understanding of the gospel has given me guidance on the kind of father and now grandfather I should be. My testimony, gained in my youth, has helped me respond to every call in the Church, including this current overwhelming call to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. My testimony, obtained a long time ago on the street corners of England, has grown line upon line and precept upon precept until I can stand before you tonight, my dear young friends, and testify as a special witness of the Lord Jesus Christ that our Savior lives and he is the Son of God our Eternal Father. My life has never been the same since I anchored my soul to the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, lets return for a moment to the analogy of the ships anchor, especially the massive anchor chain. Suppose a beautiful sailing ship had been manufactured from the finest materials and had been reinforced and strengthened for the roughest seas. The mast and sails had been prepared carefully and were sturdy and seaworthy. Suppose the anchor was above standard in size and weight and craftsmanship. But, suppose, by some inadvertent error, the chain attached to the anchor was inferior and weak. Visualize what would happen the first time the anchor was lowered, or the first time a strong wave tried to push the anchored ship out to sea. If any link of the chain holding the anchor broke, the anchor would be left to rust on the bottom of the ocean floor and the ship would drift and perhaps be destroyed.</p>
<p>The comparison to our lives is plain. The links in our chain of faith and testimony that enable our personal anchor to keep us safe and secure are the simple doctrines and teachings of the gospel. For example, can you see the value of the gospel link of personal prayer? Those of you who are single can kneel in a quiet and private place and pray for guidance before you leave your home and after you return each day. If you are married, you can join hands with your spouse and take turns offering companion prayers. Thanking your Heavenly Father for your blessings will help you remain secure. Pray for the help you need in your personal life, your education, your career, and your relationships. You students must know that the Lord will help you understand calculus and economics as surely as he will help you understand the principles of the gospel if you ask him after doing all that you can on your own.</p>
<p>Can you see another gospel link in your chain being the Word of Wisdom? By faithfully living the Lords law of health, that link in the chain will help you keep your physical bodies strong. At the same time, you "shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" that will help you be more committed to the Church (see D&amp;C 89:19).</p>
<p>Another link is the law of tithing. You understand, I believe, that paying a full tithe is not a matter of money; it is a matter of faith. You can pay a full tithe regardless of your income if you develop the faith to do so. The Lord surely will "open the windows of heaven" as he has promised to those who are obedient to this commandment (see Malachi 3:10 and 3 Nephi 24:10).</p>
<p>How about the links of honesty, moral purity, service to others, attendance at Church meetings, and studying the scriptures, to name just a few? These links of your gospel anchor chain may seem somewhat elementary, but they are as important as the anchor of faith and testimony itself. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. We must take care every day to examine our own personal chain to anchor our souls to the gospel and see if we have any weak links that may make us vulnerable to the influences of the devil.</p>
<p>One good way to keep every link strong is to partake of the sacrament each week. As you know, the sacrament is a renewal and a reminder of all our covenants with the Lord. What a great time for personal introspection and reflection on our life during the past week. Make the sacrament a time to review your personal gospel chain and see if each link is equal to the task of anchoring you securely to the Church.</p>
<p>Last of all, for those of you who have been temple endowed, doing temple work will keep this link strong. The temple is the house of the Lord. Take the time to go as often as you can to feel the presence of Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>My dear young brothers and sisters, your personal chain that anchors your soul to the gospel can be as strong as you want to make it through a daily review of your life. Be grateful for the principle of repentance, which provides the way for us to strengthen any weak links in our personal chain. Be worthy and at peace within yourself. If you know that you are anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ but still feel like lifes trials are more than you can handle, find peace and strength in the knowledge that each day you have done the best you can in honoring the Lord. Remember that strengthening your testimony is a lifelong process. Never become discouraged and overwhelmed. Look to the Lord for strength to overcome discouragement and hopelessness. Work on one link at a time and strengthen each until you can feel anchored safely and securely to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I am reminded of what Helaman said to his sons, Nephi and Lehi, some thirty years before Christ was born:</p>
<p><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. </i>[Helaman 5:12]</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, we cannot fall if we are anchored securely to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and if we forge strong links in an anchor chain that will hold us fast to the sure and simple principles of the gospel.</p>
<p>Repentance is a great blessing that our Father has given to us. Use it if you need to. And I promise you, in the name of the Lord, that as you honestly deal with yourself in those quiet moments and resolve to strengthen any link in your gospel anchor chain that needs your attention, you will find that strength.</p>
<p>Now, in closing, I think many of you who are here in the Marriott Center and in the stake centers hearing our broadcast feel it would sure be nice to get to the point where Brother Ballard is where you dont have any worries. Let me tell you, and put your mind at ease, at least about this apostle. I better not speak for all of my associates. Weve all had our challenges. Ive certainly had mine. Ive had my challenges and disappointments. Ive had those moments of feeling somewhat desperate - when I was in business and decisions seemed to go against me, and I wondered why. Ive had health struggles, as perhaps many of you have. But all of the challenges, if we handle them right, staying solidly anchored to the Master, we can manage.</p>
<p>Years ago I took a young man to meet President Kimball. He said he had given up hope, that he didnt believe there was a God anymore because his mother had passed away with cancer. He loved his mother, and he said to the president, "If there really was a God, he never would have let my mother suffer and die as she did."</p>
<p>Then President Kimball, in that wonderful sweet way of his, put his hands on the shoulders of my nineteen-year-old friend and said, "My boy, your mother is all right. Sit down, and lets talk about you."</p>
<p>Then he taught him in a beautiful way. One of the things he taught that I shall never forget ties to this matter of strengthening your anchor chain. He said, "My boy, Ive had a lot of health challenges. I had cancer of the throat. Ive had my body opened from here to here with open-heart surgery in my mid-seventies. Ive had all kinds of challenges healthwise." Then he looked at my friend and at me and said, "And through my suffering I have come to know God."</p>
<p>My beloved young brothers and sisters, you do face and will face challenges. You did not come here thinking that you were going to pass through this experience without difficulties and challenge. I promise you in the name of the Lord, and bless you, by and through the holy apostleship invested in me, if you will remain unwaveringly anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ and devote your heart and soul to him, and if youve made mistakes if you will come unto him and give away your sins through the principle of repentance and commit to serve him and honor him all the days of your life, you will be blessed and all of the promises of the eternities will be given unto you. That I know.</p>
<p>How grateful we are for every one of you. You are precious to the Church. You are precious to your families. You are precious to the countries of your origins.</p>
<p>I invoke a blessing also that you may have strength come to you now, that as you study at whatever university you are attending you will prepare yourselves to take up the labors of the sons and daughters of God who know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he has restored the church and kingdom of God to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>With that knowledge, my beloved young friends, go forward now, bless this great world that you live in. Bless your associates. Bless your families. And may all of the peace and joy and happiness be yours because of your faithfulness, I humbly pray in the sacred and beloved name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In recent years there have been glowing, breathless reports appearing in the media that speak of a new approach to problem solving. This method promises a competitive edge for businesses, organizations, and governments alike. Innovation consultants use the approach to tease out new ideas, collecting hefty fees in the process. Time magazine, Harvard Business Review, and a new binge-worthy Netflix series all extol its virtues.1
In the corporate boardroom, the CDO, or the chief design officer, has joined the ranks of the CEO and the CFO. Design-driven companies like Apple, Nike, and Target consistently outperform their competitors.2 It seems that "design thinking," as it is known, is all the rage. Corporate profits alone, however, cannot explain all the new interest in design thinking.
In 1973 a German design theorist introduced the concept of a "wicked problem."3 Contrary to what you might expect by the name, a wicked problem does not refer to something evil or sinister but instead describes something so tricky and complicated that it seems to defy solution. With a wicked problem, the situation is dynamic and often involves multiple variables. Both the exact nature of the problem and the solutions remain unknown when the project begins. Examples of wicked problems might include climate change, poverty, the Syrian civil war, or American healthcare, to name a few. For these problems there are no easy answers, no silver bullets.
When other approaches fail, design thinking offers a fairly reliable process for solving wicked problems. It values empathy, understanding, and usability, all part of the human experience. Instead of counting widgets or poring over sales charts, design thinking takes a more anthropological approach, uncovering the human motivations behind complex problems.
As I thought about the message I could share with you today, I was reminded that many design principles offer insight into solving some of lifes great challenges. I believe that by applying these principles to your own wicked problems, your chance of solving them may improve. While this morning I have chosen to apply these principles to building a testimony, the methods are transferable to any problem you face in your life that you deem wicked.
Before we review these principles, take a moment to think. What is your wicked problem?
Maybe it is making your next tuition payment, choosing a new roommate, finding a summer internship, or even getting a date for Saturday night. Perhaps, though, your wicked problem is more complex - maybe it is a bit trickier. You struggle with certain Church doctrines, you doubt your testimony, or you wonder whether you will stay active in the Church after you graduate.
My maternal grandparents, Bill and Aleda Shuldberg, faced problems very similar to these. They were about the same age as many of you when they were courting in 1928.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many who speak at a Brigham Young University devotional make reference to their experiences as students at BYU and the insights they have gained by attending devotionals. I cant do that because I never attended BYU. I am a Utah State University Aggie, and my Aggie blue runs deep. I am a big Cougar fan, but even after twenty years of holding season tickets for BYU basketball and football, I still cant bring myself to sing, "Rise and shout."
In those same twenty years I have also attended devotionals as a faculty member and have heard the testimonies of many of my colleagues and felt the spirit of many students as they have borne testimony through music. I am particularly humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today in a place where prophets and apostles have taught and testified.
Do We Really Believe in the Resurrection?
I am the youngest in a family of four boys, and about twenty-two years ago I was encouraged to apply for a faculty opening here at BYU in the Department of Mathematics. At the time, I was a faculty member at Oregon State University, and my three older brothers lived in Iowa, Washington, and California, while my parents lived in Logan, Utah. In addition to this being a great opportunity for me to come to BYU, it allowed me to be a little closer to my parents, because their health was failing.
My father did not want my decision to move to Utah to be based in any way on helping him and my mother. He was very proud of the fact that his sons were contributing to the kingdom outside of Utah. My wife, Shauna, and I felt that the move to BYU was the right decision, and we arrived here in August 1996.
Six months after our arrival in Provo, my father had surgery in Salt Lake City to repair a heart valve. Ten years earlier his original valve had been replaced with a pig valve, at which time he contracted hepatitis C. Because this pig valve was now failing, the doctors decided to replace it with a mechanical valve. During the surgery the doctors realized that the hepatitis C had wreaked havoc on my fathers liver, which made the heart surgery very traumatic on his body. This was the beginning of a seventeen-day roller coaster ride.
At this time my mothers health was not good, so she was only able to visit my dad about every two to three days. Thus the responsibility of visiting my father and communicating with the doctors fell to my wife and me. One or the other of us would travel from Mapleton, about ten miles south of Provo, to the hospital in Salt Lake City every day. Many times my wife would visit in the afternoon, and I would spend the evening at the hospital, or vice versa. This was particularly challenging because we had four children ranging in age from three to nine.
I referred to this time as a roller coaster ride because on one day a particular doctor would be pessimistic and on the next day another doctor would be optimistic about the eventual outcome.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, President Worthen, for the nice introduction. President Worthen mentioned that I graduated from the University of Utah. If that fact troubles any of you because of the long-standing sports rivalry, let me put your mind at ease. I recently received a very nice thank-you note from a graduating student. After saying lots of nice things, he concluded his note by saying, "Despite the fact that you graduated from the U, I think youre a great guy." So dont worry: I am a great guy, and I am thrilled to be here at BYU with so many great students and colleagues. I hope each of you feels that way too.
The World Is a Dangerous Place
Last week I had a great time with my son Tate and the rest of the priests and teachers from our ward on their annual high adventure trip. Among other things, we kayaked on the Green River and mountain biked in the La Sal Mountains. One of the highlights of the trip was rappelling down a 175-foot cliff below a double arch. Dont get the wrong impression; I am not a great adventurer and I am definitely not an experienced climber. I have always had a fear of heights, and before last week I had never rappelled. As I started the descent, the engineer in me started to think about how ropes can fray and carabiners can break. I know my fears were irrational, but there is some inherent danger in rappelling. Maybe a little healthy fear is a good thing if it helps me stay safe.
Rappelling isnt the only dangerous thing in the world. In fact, the world is basically a dangerous place. Here are some numbers from an article I read some years ago that illustrate what I mean:

You have a one in 11 million risk of dying from an earthquake or volcano.
There is a one in 12 million chance you will die from leaking gas.
You have a one in 6 million probability of being injured in an elevator ride.
There is a one in 23 million chance that you will die from drinking detergent.
Your risk of being infected with flesh-eating bacteria is one in 170,000.
You have a one in 11,000 chance of being murdered, a one in 400 chance of being robbed, and a one in fifty chance of being burglarized.
Certain risks depend on where you are born. For example, in the United States you have a one in 100 chance of dying before the age of five. In South Asia, on the other hand, you have one chance in eight.
Other risks have to do with whether you are a man or a woman. For example, men are 2.3 times as likely to die in a car crash and 3.3 times as likely to accidentally poison themselves than are women.
Women in the United States, on the other hand, have a one in 12,500 chance of dying in childbirth.
Im sure some of you have wondered this: what are your chances of being struck by lightning this year? The answer is one in 750,000.
And, finally, a piece of good news: What are the odds that you will be hit by a meteor? O</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My father was a builder of big buildings, some well known. So when I returned from my two-year mission to Japan and wanted summer work, I ended up forty feet down at the bottom of an air conditioning shaft, stripping forms from freshly poured concrete. My captive coworker, Chuck, made the mistake of asking why I would "waste two valuable years like that." I am sure he had no idea what he was in for, and I unleashed my abundance of missionary zeal.
At some point in our discussion I heard a noise overhead and saw the familiar silhouette of my father leaning over the shaft. What he said was a surprise: "Chuck, I dont know what hes saying down there, but I believe it is true. Now get back to work."
This is for me the most treasured testimony my father bore, but I hope we can surpass that level of communication today. I dont want you to go back to class thinking, "I dont know what he was saying down there, but I believe it is true." Instead I want to persuade you to rethink the way you communicate to others your feelings about your connections to heaven and the amazing blessings of what you know and what you feel.
Why persuade? Because "no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood" - and I hold no position that grants me that kind of dominion over you anyway - "only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;C 121:41). I want to persuade you to consider another perspective that will help you follow the counsel of an apostle.
Elder David A. Bednar stood here in August and asked us "to sweep the earth as with a flood of truth and righteousness" in our online efforts ("To Sweep the Earth as with a Flood," BYU Education Week devotional address, 19 August 2014, lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/to-sweep-the-earth-as-with-a-flood). His devotional was historic in many ways. I was so delighted.
Elder Bednars first qualification for this effort was simple:
We are disciples, and our messages should be authentic. A person or product that is not authentic is false, fake, and fraudulent. Our messages should be truthful, honest, and accurate. We should not exaggerate, embellish, or pretend to be someone or something we are not. ["To Sweep the Earth"]
Following his counsel to be authentic will be more difficult for us, as central-culture Mormons, because for decades we have desired to honor the Lord by always putting our best foot forward. Look down at your feet, if you will. The problem is that nearly every mortal has two feet, and most require both of those feet to stand properly.
Over the past ten years I have regularly had the punishment and privilege of watching through a one-way mirror as focus groups discuss Mormons. The people in these groups were not just any people; they were selected for these sessions because their beliefs and actions demo</span>
