  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="In recent years there have been glowing, breathless reports appearing in the media that speak of a new approach to problem solving. This method promises a competitive edge for businesses, organizations, and governments alike. Innovation consultants use the approach to tease out new ideas, collecting hefty fees in the process. &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine, &lt;i&gt;Harvard Business Review,&lt;/i&gt; and a new binge-worthy Netflix series all extol its virtues.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

In the corporate boardroom, the CDO, or the chief design officer, has joined the ranks of the CEO and the CFO. Design-driven companies like Apple, Nike, and Target consistently outperform their competitors.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; It seems that "design thinking," as it is known, is all the rage. Corporate profits alone, however, cannot explain all the new interest in design thinking.

In 1973 a German design theorist introduced the concept of a "wicked problem."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Contrary to what you might expect by the name, a wicked problem does not refer to something evil or sinister but instead describes something so tricky and complicated that it seems to defy solution. With a wicked problem, the situation is dynamic and often involves multiple variables. Both the exact nature of the problem and the solutions remain unknown when the project begins. Examples of wicked problems might include climate change, poverty, the Syrian civil war, or American healthcare, to name a few. For these problems there are no easy answers, no silver bullets.

When other approaches fail, design thinking offers a fairly reliable process for solving wicked problems. It values empathy, understanding, and usability, all part of the human experience. Instead of counting widgets or poring over sales charts, design thinking takes a more anthropological approach, uncovering the human motivations behind complex problems.

As I thought about the message I could share with you today, I was reminded that many design principles offer insight into solving some of lifes great challenges. I believe that by applying these principles to your own wicked problems, your chance of solving them may improve. While this morning I have chosen to apply these principles to building a testimony, the methods are transferable to any problem you face in your life that you deem wicked.

Before we review these principles, take a moment to think. What is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; wicked problem?

Maybe it is making your next tuition payment, choosing a new roommate, finding a summer internship, or even getting a date for Saturday night. Perhaps, though, your wicked problem is more complex - maybe it is a bit trickier. You struggle with certain Church doctrines, you doubt your testimony, or you wonder whether you will stay active in the Church after you graduate.

My maternal grandparents, Bill and Aleda Shuldberg, faced problems very similar to these. They were about the same age as many of you when they were courting in 1928. Although they did not have the luxury of attending college or know the stress of choosing a major, they both struggled with feelings of resentment toward the Church and toward their very active, devout parents.

As a boy, my grandfather posed with his mother and siblings for a family photo to be sent to his father, who was serving a mission in Sweden, his native country. What you do not see in the photo is the harsh poverty they endured while their father was away.

My fourteen-year-old grandfather and his sixteen-year-old brother were tasked with running a large dry farm all on their own. With no time left for schooling, my grandfather dropped out to carry the heavy burden of supporting the family on his young shoulders. He was particularly incensed at his father and Church leaders for the extra physical burden this placed on his mother, who at one point had to haul water for drinking, washing, and cooking from a well that was six miles from their home.

My Grandmother Aleda had also experienced hardship while she was growing up. She frequently recalled being left hungry and alone while her mother, the ward Relief Society president, traveled to help neighbors and friends during childbirth, distress, or illness. Her mother often stayed away for nights on end.

It is little wonder that both Bill and Aleda felt forgotten, marginalized, and bitter. They longed for escape and found comfort in their common circumstances. Against the advice of their parents and the bishop, and while they were expecting their first child, they struck off on their own for a place called Mud Lake, Idaho. Their timing could not have been worse, because just a few months later the stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression.

On arriving in Mud Lake, my grandparents found much of the land abandoned. It had been devastated by drought, harsh weather, and crop-eating jackrabbits, so earlier homesteaders had picked up and moved away. Bill and Aleda had no money, no work, and very little education, so having a testimony at that point in their lives was not a priority. My grandparents had a wicked problem.

The allegory on testimony found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.38-39?lang=eng#p37&quot;&gt;Alma 32:3839&lt;/a&gt; perfectly describes their circumstances:

&lt;i&gt;If ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . It is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.&lt;/i&gt;

Design-thinking principles are not the exclusive domain of designers. As my grandparents story shows, they apply to everyone. Although they most likely would dismiss these ideas as hoity-toity nonsense, my grandparents actively employed them to great success in their lives. You will recognize many of these principles as natural, even obvious parts of your own problem-solving routine because, to a large extent, design thinking is simply gospel thinking.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having Faith in Ambiguity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Before beginning the design process, we must agree to a few conditions. First, since solutions to wicked problems cannot be reduced to a series of linear steps, the uncertainty found in the beginning is to be expected. I have heard this phase referred to as "the fuzzy front end."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Another designer visualized the design process in a haphazard, chaotic drawing called the "design squiggle."&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; The squiggle accurately depicts every design problem I have faced, most discussions at our family dinner table, and, most important, my own search for a testimony. Although the design process begins with uncertainty, a designer recognizes ambiguity as an opportunity to innovate, disrupt the status quo, or reframe a problem. A designer believes a solution to their problem will eventually appear. While the secular world would be loath to label this concept faith, the parallels are unmistakable.

When my grandparents began their fuzzy, complicated journey, they had few other options. Perhaps naively, they maintained enough faith to believe in a positive outcome, no matter how precarious their risk.

I feel certain that Joseph Smith would find the squiggle similar to his own experience as a young man searching for a solution to his wicked problem. Like some of us, he was confused by contradictory information. He struggled with Church doctrine, doubted his testimony, and was not sure if he would remain an active churchgoer.

As you consider the condition of your own testimony, do not overlook the importance of doubt. Doubt causes you to question. It causes you to study. It causes you to seek reassurance from loved ones and your leaders. Most important, it causes you to approach the Lord for guidance.

Rather than a sign of rebellion, I believe doubt to be an essential part of the testimony-building process. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p4&quot;&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt; we read:

&lt;i&gt;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.&lt;/i&gt;

"Upbraideth not" means the Lord will not find offense in your questions. Rather, He wants to guide us toward the answers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8?lang=eng#p7&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Covenants 9:8&lt;/a&gt; suggests:

&lt;i&gt;You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.&lt;/i&gt;

While many of his initial questions were answered by the events of the First Vision, the uncertainty that Joseph Smith faced would remain with him for years. Like an effective design thinker, he had to stay curious and open while undertaking a new experiment. He had to embrace uncertainty as both an opportunity and as a motivating force and maintain sufficient faith to proceed.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Prepared Mind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The chemist Louis Pasteur identified our second condition when he said, "In the fields of observation, chance only favours the mind which is prepared."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Working to solve a particularly difficult problem, he said, "I am on the verge of mysteries, and . . . the veil which covers them is getting thinner and thinner."&lt;sup&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;Pasteur was referring to the intense preparation that precedes a significant breakthrough - the aha moment. Those moments typically come &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; a domain has been mastered, not before. In other words, Louis Pasteur didnt just dabble in chemistry; he made it his lifes work. Before we can recognize an important insight into our own wicked problem, we have to first put in the effort required to study it out in our minds.

Bill and Aleda couldnt dabble in farm work either. They had to show up for work seven days a week, no excuses. Dependent on favorable weather and a small herd of farm animals, they had to be all in.

With a slight change, could we not adapt the concept of a prepared mind to testimony and the spiritual realm? The work of building testimony comes through the everyday activities of Church membership - home teaching, serving as the ward nursery leader, personal prayer, and study. Chance dictates that if we choose to &lt;i&gt;engage&lt;/i&gt; in the work of the Church rather than &lt;i&gt;dabble&lt;/i&gt; in it, our minds will be prepared to recognize the Spirits confirmation.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Line upon Line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
For my grandparents, their first steps together were tentative. After living and working in Mud Lake with extended family during their first year of marriage, Bill and Aleda decided to stay. One day while twenty miles out on the desert, my grandfather found a fixer-upper - an old, two-room house on an abandoned homestead. With eight borrowed horses, he and a friend hoisted the house up and put it on two sleds and dragged it back twenty miles across the frozen desert. Later, when the family had outgrown that house, construction began on a new one. Before the house was finished, however, World War II broke out, and building materials were rationed. The family moved into the basement, where they lived for ten years until the house could be finished.

Whether they knew it or not, my grandparents were demonstrating another design principle. The term &lt;i&gt;heuristic&lt;/i&gt; roughly translates to "find" or "discover." It implies problem solving by active experimentation through a pattern of trial and error. In other words, fake it until you make it.

Bill and Aleda built their house line upon line as resources became available. For us, faced with a similar problem, it doesnt really matter sometimes what your first step is. The important thing is that you have taken one. When things dont go as planned, taking a single step can cause self-doubt, fear, and paralysis to fade. Your confidence will increase, and another step will then seem possible.

This process is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p29&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 28:30&lt;/a&gt;, when the Lord said:

&lt;i&gt;I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.&lt;/i&gt;

A cognitive scientist referred to this process as "incremental development."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; We make our best guess based on the knowledge we have at the time and then move forward.

For a designer, the process looks something like this: We have an idea and start with a &lt;i&gt;thumbnail&lt;/i&gt; sketch. Most of the time we fail. A wise designer shared this thought: "Fail early to succeed sooner."&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; After a slight adjustment, based on our first experience, we try again. This time we call it a &lt;i&gt;rough comp.&lt;/i&gt; Again the process continues line upon line, sketch after sketch, as we make gradual adjustments. At some point one of our ideas bears fruit, and something interesting starts to happen. An idea takes shape and begins to appear. We call it a &lt;i&gt;tight comp.&lt;/i&gt; Although not perfect, our idea improves as we continue to refine until suddenly we are getting somewhere and have a &lt;i&gt;final comp.&lt;/i&gt;

With no stable income, Bill and Aleda traded their extra eggs and butter to a local farmer for what they called "bum lambs." Since the lambs mothers had died during birth and other ewes would not accept them, bum lambs were sometimes left to starve because they required constant attention. Bill and Aleda woke every two hours to hand-feed the lambs from a pop bottle filled with cows milk.

In the midst of these struggles they found refuge in the friendship of other Church members facing similar challenges. As more children came and hearts began to soften, they began to participate in activities with local branch members. Line upon line, precept upon precept, their fragile testimonies grew as they planted small seeds in their hearts:

&lt;i&gt;If ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p27&quot;&gt;Alma 32:28&lt;/a&gt;]

As a fourteen-year-old boy, Joseph Smith had no idea what he was getting himself into when he inquired of the Lord "which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#17&quot;&gt;Joseph Smith - History 1:18&lt;/a&gt;). Joseph said, "It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.14?lang=eng#13&quot;&gt;Joseph Smith - History 1:14&lt;/a&gt;).

In his anxiety, Joseph had taken his first shaky step without knowing where it would lead. Then he waited for further direction. He was proceeding heuristically - he began with a thumbnail sketch. After years of building line upon line, he eventually restored the keys and the authority and the organization that brings us here today.

Now, if you are like me, comparing my own experience and spiritual maturity at age fourteen to Joseph Smiths is, well, a little awkward. I dont see much correlation. But I take great comfort in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.11,12?lang=eng#10&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Covenants 46:1112&lt;/a&gt;, which explains that gifts of the Spirit are given to each of us in different ways:

&lt;i&gt;For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.&lt;/i&gt;

This scripture offers reassurance that I dont have to measure up to a prophet. My spiritual gifts and small steps toward building a testimony will be different than his and different than yours. We all start in different places, and the Lord will meet us wherever we are.

Alma invited us to begin

&lt;i&gt;an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27?lang=eng#p26&quot;&gt;Alma 32:27&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Divergent Gospel Thinking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My favorite part of the design process is the "what if" or ideation phase of design thinking. Curiosity and an ability to generate many ideas is a key characteristic of a design thinker. In the words of the chemist and author Linus Pauling, "If you want to have good ideas, you must have &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; ideas."&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

Divergent thinking means thinking inside, outside, and under the box. Designers may change their perspective, reframe the problem, or challenge a widely held assumption. Using active methods that flip, invert, or reverse, they work to disrupt conventional ways of thinking.

One of my favorite divergent thinking methods is called &lt;i&gt;bisociation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; More commonly known as a mash-up, it forces together two unrelated domains in an effort to find an unexpected combination. Your experience at BYU is an example of a mash-up. You could all receive an excellent education at another university, but instead you are combining a rigorous study of your major (one domain) with matters of faith (another domain). The hope is that something innovative will result from this unique combination. The smartphone in your hand is also an example of bisociative thinking; it is a big, beautiful, addictive mash-up of many technologies.

Bill and Aleda perfected the mash-up by thinking divergently with humor and grace. When a family member needed a new dress, they went to the mill with Aleda to choose a flour sack. When the sack was empty, it was dismantled and sewn into their new dress. Aleda saved every scrap of fabric, no matter how worn. She remade tattered coats to fit smaller family members, turned Grandpas old ties into what is called a crazy quilt, and braided the leftover scraps into rugs. When Grandma got her hands on a surplus parachute after the war, she was giddy about repurposing the fancy new fabric called nylon. Spreading out the parachute on the living room floor, she began to cut out patterns for all of her children, then for all of her nieces, and, finally, for all of the neighbors. Never mind that the nylon was hot and itchy, everyone was going to have a new blouse.

Not to be outdone, Grandpas bum lambs grew into a mighty flock. During the harvest, lambing, and grazing seasons, he often hired extra farmhands and knew exactly where to find them. As a very tall deputy sheriff, he was in charge of crowd control at the local dance hall on Saturday night. His billy club knew exactly where to land when the drunken sheepherders got out of hand. Then, on the next day, the Sabbath, he was the local bishop. In a beautiful mash-up of gospel teaching, farm work, and law enforcement, he took the &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; bum lambs into his home, his fields, and his ward. Many received their first introduction to the gospel through Brother Bill.

My grandparents also frequently prayed over their flocks and fields. For them, mashing together work and worship came naturally. While most of us no longer work in the fields or with the flocks, the principle is still valid. We can ask for divine guidance in any aspect of our lives - home, school, or family life.

The Prophet Joseph Smith is also an excellent example of a divergent thinker. The founding story of the Church reveals him to be a radical thinker who challenged long-held assumptions, questioned authority, and gave voice to highly divergent ideas. I find it slightly ironic that divergent thinking, questioning, or rethinking the status quo may appear to some as antithetical to Church culture. It is true that as small children we learn to sing:

&lt;i&gt;Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Follow the prophet; dont go astray.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Follow the prophet; he knows the way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Yet the principle of obedience is distinct, complementary, and compatible with the principle of divergent thinking. In my experience, the most effective and obedient home or visiting teachers are the ones who break from the standard script. They use creativity to serve the needs of their families.

Thinking divergently about your testimony offers the chance to escape the familiar ruts and tired patterns of Church membership. If Church life is stale, it is time to disrupt your routine. Try home teaching on the &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; day of the month. Say one prayer without resorting to vain repetition. Sing harmony this Sunday instead of the melody, and do it as loud as you dare. Rather than say you know the Church is true when you might not, bear your testimony of a single point of doctrine that you do know is true.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prototype Early to Succeed Sooner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
After hovering in the ideation phase for as long as possible, we eventually converge upon our best ideas in the prototype and testing phase. Learning from mistakes and failures, we apply the knowledge to our next iteration; consequently, the veil gets thinner. By its very nature a prototype signifies a work in progress and implies that we will fail. To the experienced design thinker, failure is only temporary; it is simply part of the process. Henry Ford said, "Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again."&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

In his journal Joseph Smith described himself as "a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else."&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;

What did Joseph mean? He was undergoing user testing. His ideas were in the rapid prototyping department. He was a work in progress.

After the Lord has shown you line upon line, precept upon precept, He promises to "try you and prove you herewith" (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12?lang=eng#p11&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;C 98:12&lt;/a&gt;). Bills growth in the Church came incrementally. His leadership skills were prototyped and tested as he served as the first presiding elder, branch president, and finally bishop of Mud Lake - a position he held for ten years. When the time finally came to build a chapel, the work fell to local ward members. Since they were all farmers, they could only work on the building during the cold winter months. As the building neared completion, a date for its dedication was set.

But in the rush to finish, my grandfather realized in horror that they had forgotten to budget for chairs or pews, and the congregation was completely out of money. Faced with the approaching deadline, he remembered a coffee can sitting on the top shelf in his kitchen at home. To earn money for new winter coats, the children had cared for a new crop of bum lambs all summer and had just sold them at market. The tin can contained all their hard-earned money. The Shuldberg family quietly took the can down, consecrated their offering to the Lord, and bought chairs for the new chapel.

With their prototyping and test complete, a promised blessing now awaited them. Aleda made over their old winter coats and they attended the dedication, sitting in new chairs that others barely noticed. On the day of the dedication, the apostle Joseph F. Merrill came from Salt Lake City to offer the dedicatory prayer. Unaware that the farmers usually ran out of irrigation water long before the growing season was over, he blessed the stunned members that there would always be sufficient water for their crops. Shortly thereafter one of the largest underground aquifers in the United States was discovered below Mud Lake.

In the words of Alma:

&lt;i&gt;And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet . . . ; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.42?lang=eng#p41&quot;&gt;Alma 32:42&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
By applying basic principles of design and gospel thinking, we can accept Almas advice to experiment upon the word. Like the braided rug made with Aledas scraps of fabric, a testimony only becomes durable and resilient when the small, individual experiences of gospel living are woven together. What was once discarded, worn, and insignificant on its own can offer great strength and comfort in the face of wicked problems.

So when the trial of your faith or any other wicked problem comes, remember to do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Embrace doubt and uncertainty as essential elements in problem solving. Let them motivate you to seek greater understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Remember that a testimony as well as knowledge are built line upon line. Rather than focusing on what may seem like an unreachable goal, incremental development comes from small, well-placed steps.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;If chance favors the prepared mind, your preparation will come through &lt;i&gt;immersing&lt;/i&gt; yourself in Church life rather than through &lt;i&gt;dabbling&lt;/i&gt; in it.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;If gospel living has become routine and uninspiring or if you feel stuck with a problem, look to change your perspective through divergent gospel thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Finally, growth in your testimony comes only through the tests and trials of life. Prototype early and often to succeed sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
From my own personal experience, if you have even a desire to believe, the seed of testimony can grow and take root within your heart. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>In recent years there have been glowing, breathless reports appearing in the media that speak of a new approach to problem solving. This method promises a competitive edge for businesses, organizations, and governments alike. Innovation consultants use the approach to tease out new ideas, collecting hefty fees in the process. <i>Time</i> magazine, <i>Harvard Business Review,</i> and a new binge-worthy Netflix series all extol its virtues.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In the corporate boardroom, the CDO, or the chief design officer, has joined the ranks of the CEO and the CFO. Design-driven companies like Apple, Nike, and Target consistently outperform their competitors.<sup>2</sup> It seems that "design thinking," as it is known, is all the rage. Corporate profits alone, however, cannot explain all the new interest in design thinking.</p>
<p>In 1973 a German design theorist introduced the concept of a "wicked problem."<sup>3</sup> Contrary to what you might expect by the name, a wicked problem does not refer to something evil or sinister but instead describes something so tricky and complicated that it seems to defy solution. With a wicked problem, the situation is dynamic and often involves multiple variables. Both the exact nature of the problem and the solutions remain unknown when the project begins. Examples of wicked problems might include climate change, poverty, the Syrian civil war, or American healthcare, to name a few. For these problems there are no easy answers, no silver bullets.</p>
<p>When other approaches fail, design thinking offers a fairly reliable process for solving wicked problems. It values empathy, understanding, and usability, all part of the human experience. Instead of counting widgets or poring over sales charts, design thinking takes a more anthropological approach, uncovering the human motivations behind complex problems.</p>
<p>As I thought about the message I could share with you today, I was reminded that many design principles offer insight into solving some of lifes great challenges. I believe that by applying these principles to your own wicked problems, your chance of solving them may improve. While this morning I have chosen to apply these principles to building a testimony, the methods are transferable to any problem you face in your life that you deem wicked.</p>
<p>Before we review these principles, take a moment to think. What is <i>your</i> wicked problem?</p>
<p>Maybe it is making your next tuition payment, choosing a new roommate, finding a summer internship, or even getting a date for Saturday night. Perhaps, though, your wicked problem is more complex - maybe it is a bit trickier. You struggle with certain Church doctrines, you doubt your testimony, or you wonder whether you will stay active in the Church after you graduate.</p>
<p>My maternal grandparents, Bill and Aleda Shuldberg, faced problems very similar to these. They were about the same age as many of you when they were courting in 1928. Although they did not have the luxury of attending college or know the stress of choosing a major, they both struggled with feelings of resentment toward the Church and toward their very active, devout parents.</p>
<p>As a boy, my grandfather posed with his mother and siblings for a family photo to be sent to his father, who was serving a mission in Sweden, his native country. What you do not see in the photo is the harsh poverty they endured while their father was away.</p>
<p>My fourteen-year-old grandfather and his sixteen-year-old brother were tasked with running a large dry farm all on their own. With no time left for schooling, my grandfather dropped out to carry the heavy burden of supporting the family on his young shoulders. He was particularly incensed at his father and Church leaders for the extra physical burden this placed on his mother, who at one point had to haul water for drinking, washing, and cooking from a well that was six miles from their home.</p>
<p>My Grandmother Aleda had also experienced hardship while she was growing up. She frequently recalled being left hungry and alone while her mother, the ward Relief Society president, traveled to help neighbors and friends during childbirth, distress, or illness. Her mother often stayed away for nights on end.</p>
<p>It is little wonder that both Bill and Aleda felt forgotten, marginalized, and bitter. They longed for escape and found comfort in their common circumstances. Against the advice of their parents and the bishop, and while they were expecting their first child, they struck off on their own for a place called Mud Lake, Idaho. Their timing could not have been worse, because just a few months later the stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>On arriving in Mud Lake, my grandparents found much of the land abandoned. It had been devastated by drought, harsh weather, and crop-eating jackrabbits, so earlier homesteaders had picked up and moved away. Bill and Aleda had no money, no work, and very little education, so having a testimony at that point in their lives was not a priority. My grandparents had a wicked problem.</p>
<p>The allegory on testimony found in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.38-39?lang=eng#p37">Alma 32:3839</a> perfectly describes their circumstances:</p>
<p><i>If ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . It is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</i></p>
<p>Design-thinking principles are not the exclusive domain of designers. As my grandparents story shows, they apply to everyone. Although they most likely would dismiss these ideas as hoity-toity nonsense, my grandparents actively employed them to great success in their lives. You will recognize many of these principles as natural, even obvious parts of your own problem-solving routine because, to a large extent, design thinking is simply gospel thinking.</p>
<h2><b>Having Faith in Ambiguity</b></h2>
<p>Before beginning the design process, we must agree to a few conditions. First, since solutions to wicked problems cannot be reduced to a series of linear steps, the uncertainty found in the beginning is to be expected. I have heard this phase referred to as "the fuzzy front end."<sup>4</sup> Another designer visualized the design process in a haphazard, chaotic drawing called the "design squiggle."<sup>5</sup> The squiggle accurately depicts every design problem I have faced, most discussions at our family dinner table, and, most important, my own search for a testimony. Although the design process begins with uncertainty, a designer recognizes ambiguity as an opportunity to innovate, disrupt the status quo, or reframe a problem. A designer believes a solution to their problem will eventually appear. While the secular world would be loath to label this concept faith, the parallels are unmistakable.</p>
<p>When my grandparents began their fuzzy, complicated journey, they had few other options. Perhaps naively, they maintained enough faith to believe in a positive outcome, no matter how precarious their risk.</p>
<p>I feel certain that Joseph Smith would find the squiggle similar to his own experience as a young man searching for a solution to his wicked problem. Like some of us, he was confused by contradictory information. He struggled with Church doctrine, doubted his testimony, and was not sure if he would remain an active churchgoer.</p>
<p>As you consider the condition of your own testimony, do not overlook the importance of doubt. Doubt causes you to question. It causes you to study. It causes you to seek reassurance from loved ones and your leaders. Most important, it causes you to approach the Lord for guidance.</p>
<p>Rather than a sign of rebellion, I believe doubt to be an essential part of the testimony-building process. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p4">James 1:5</a> we read:</p>
<p><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.</i></p>
<p>"Upbraideth not" means the Lord will not find offense in your questions. Rather, He wants to guide us toward the answers. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 9:8</a> suggests:</p>
<p><i>You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i></p>
<p>While many of his initial questions were answered by the events of the First Vision, the uncertainty that Joseph Smith faced would remain with him for years. Like an effective design thinker, he had to stay curious and open while undertaking a new experiment. He had to embrace uncertainty as both an opportunity and as a motivating force and maintain sufficient faith to proceed.</p>
<h2><b>A Prepared Mind</b></h2>
<p>The chemist Louis Pasteur identified our second condition when he said, "In the fields of observation, chance only favours the mind which is prepared."<sup>6</sup> Working to solve a particularly difficult problem, he said, "I am on the verge of mysteries, and . . . the veil which covers them is getting thinner and thinner."<sup>7 </sup>Pasteur was referring to the intense preparation that precedes a significant breakthrough - the aha moment. Those moments typically come <i>after</i> a domain has been mastered, not before. In other words, Louis Pasteur didnt just dabble in chemistry; he made it his lifes work. Before we can recognize an important insight into our own wicked problem, we have to first put in the effort required to study it out in our minds.</p>
<p>Bill and Aleda couldnt dabble in farm work either. They had to show up for work seven days a week, no excuses. Dependent on favorable weather and a small herd of farm animals, they had to be all in.</p>
<p>With a slight change, could we not adapt the concept of a prepared mind to testimony and the spiritual realm? The work of building testimony comes through the everyday activities of Church membership - home teaching, serving as the ward nursery leader, personal prayer, and study. Chance dictates that if we choose to <i>engage</i> in the work of the Church rather than <i>dabble</i> in it, our minds will be prepared to recognize the Spirits confirmation.</p>
<h2><b>Line upon Line</b></h2>
<p>For my grandparents, their first steps together were tentative. After living and working in Mud Lake with extended family during their first year of marriage, Bill and Aleda decided to stay. One day while twenty miles out on the desert, my grandfather found a fixer-upper - an old, two-room house on an abandoned homestead. With eight borrowed horses, he and a friend hoisted the house up and put it on two sleds and dragged it back twenty miles across the frozen desert. Later, when the family had outgrown that house, construction began on a new one. Before the house was finished, however, World War II broke out, and building materials were rationed. The family moved into the basement, where they lived for ten years until the house could be finished.</p>
<p>Whether they knew it or not, my grandparents were demonstrating another design principle. The term <i>heuristic</i> roughly translates to "find" or "discover." It implies problem solving by active experimentation through a pattern of trial and error. In other words, fake it until you make it.</p>
<p>Bill and Aleda built their house line upon line as resources became available. For us, faced with a similar problem, it doesnt really matter sometimes what your first step is. The important thing is that you have taken one. When things dont go as planned, taking a single step can cause self-doubt, fear, and paralysis to fade. Your confidence will increase, and another step will then seem possible.</p>
<p>This process is described in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p29">2 Nephi 28:30</a>, when the Lord said:</p>
<p><i>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.</i></p>
<p>A cognitive scientist referred to this process as "incremental development."<sup>8</sup> We make our best guess based on the knowledge we have at the time and then move forward.</p>
<p>For a designer, the process looks something like this: We have an idea and start with a <i>thumbnail</i> sketch. Most of the time we fail. A wise designer shared this thought: "Fail early to succeed sooner."<sup>9</sup> After a slight adjustment, based on our first experience, we try again. This time we call it a <i>rough comp.</i> Again the process continues line upon line, sketch after sketch, as we make gradual adjustments. At some point one of our ideas bears fruit, and something interesting starts to happen. An idea takes shape and begins to appear. We call it a <i>tight comp.</i> Although not perfect, our idea improves as we continue to refine until suddenly we are getting somewhere and have a <i>final comp.</i></p>
<p>With no stable income, Bill and Aleda traded their extra eggs and butter to a local farmer for what they called "bum lambs." Since the lambs mothers had died during birth and other ewes would not accept them, bum lambs were sometimes left to starve because they required constant attention. Bill and Aleda woke every two hours to hand-feed the lambs from a pop bottle filled with cows milk.</p>
<p>In the midst of these struggles they found refuge in the friendship of other Church members facing similar challenges. As more children came and hearts began to soften, they began to participate in activities with local branch members. Line upon line, precept upon precept, their fragile testimonies grew as they planted small seeds in their hearts:</p>
<p><i>If ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p27">Alma 32:28</a>]</p>
<p>As a fourteen-year-old boy, Joseph Smith had no idea what he was getting himself into when he inquired of the Lord "which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#17">Joseph Smith - History 1:18</a>). Joseph said, "It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.14?lang=eng#13">Joseph Smith - History 1:14</a>).</p>
<p>In his anxiety, Joseph had taken his first shaky step without knowing where it would lead. Then he waited for further direction. He was proceeding heuristically - he began with a thumbnail sketch. After years of building line upon line, he eventually restored the keys and the authority and the organization that brings us here today.</p>
<p>Now, if you are like me, comparing my own experience and spiritual maturity at age fourteen to Joseph Smiths is, well, a little awkward. I dont see much correlation. But I take great comfort in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.11,12?lang=eng#10">Doctrine and Covenants 46:1112</a>, which explains that gifts of the Spirit are given to each of us in different ways:</p>
<p><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i></p>
<p><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i></p>
<p>This scripture offers reassurance that I dont have to measure up to a prophet. My spiritual gifts and small steps toward building a testimony will be different than his and different than yours. We all start in different places, and the Lord will meet us wherever we are.</p>
<p>Alma invited us to begin</p>
<p><i>an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle </i><i>of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to </i><i>believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27?lang=eng#p26">Alma 32:27</a>]</p>
<h2><b>Divergent Gospel Thinking</b></h2>
<p>My favorite part of the design process is the "what if" or ideation phase of design thinking. Curiosity and an ability to generate many ideas is a key characteristic of a design thinker. In the words of the chemist and author Linus Pauling, "If you want to have good ideas, you must have <i>many</i> ideas."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Divergent thinking means thinking inside, outside, and under the box. Designers may change their perspective, reframe the problem, or challenge a widely held assumption. Using active methods that flip, invert, or reverse, they work to disrupt conventional ways of thinking.</p>
<p>One of my favorite divergent thinking methods is called <i>bisociation.</i><sup>11</sup> More commonly known as a mash-up, it forces together two unrelated domains in an effort to find an unexpected combination. Your experience at BYU is an example of a mash-up. You could all receive an excellent education at another university, but instead you are combining a rigorous study of your major (one domain) with matters of faith (another domain). The hope is that something innovative will result from this unique combination. The smartphone in your hand is also an example of bisociative thinking; it is a big, beautiful, addictive mash-up of many technologies.</p>
<p>Bill and Aleda perfected the mash-up by thinking divergently with humor and grace. When a family member needed a new dress, they went to the mill with Aleda to choose a flour sack. When the sack was empty, it was dismantled and sewn into their new dress. Aleda saved every scrap of fabric, no matter how worn. She remade tattered coats to fit smaller family members, turned Grandpas old ties into what is called a crazy quilt, and braided the leftover scraps into rugs. When Grandma got her hands on a surplus parachute after the war, she was giddy about repurposing the fancy new fabric called nylon. Spreading out the parachute on the living room floor, she began to cut out patterns for all of her children, then for all of her nieces, and, finally, for all of the neighbors. Never mind that the nylon was hot and itchy, everyone was going to have a new blouse.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Grandpas bum lambs grew into a mighty flock. During the harvest, lambing, and grazing seasons, he often hired extra farmhands and knew exactly where to find them. As a very tall deputy sheriff, he was in charge of crowd control at the local dance hall on Saturday night. His billy club knew exactly where to land when the drunken sheepherders got out of hand. Then, on the next day, the Sabbath, he was the local bishop. In a beautiful mash-up of gospel teaching, farm work, and law enforcement, he took the <i>human</i> bum lambs into his home, his fields, and his ward. Many received their first introduction to the gospel through Brother Bill.</p>
<p>My grandparents also frequently prayed over their flocks and fields. For them, mashing together work and worship came naturally. While most of us no longer work in the fields or with the flocks, the principle is still valid. We can ask for divine guidance in any aspect of our lives - home, school, or family life.</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith is also an excellent example of a divergent thinker. The founding story of the Church reveals him to be a radical thinker who challenged long-held assumptions, questioned authority, and gave voice to highly divergent ideas. I find it slightly ironic that divergent thinking, questioning, or rethinking the status quo may appear to some as antithetical to Church culture. It is true that as small children we learn to sing:</p>
<p><i>Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,</i><br />
<i>Follow the prophet; dont go astray.</i><br />
<i>Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,</i><br />
<i>Follow the prophet; he knows the way.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Yet the principle of obedience is distinct, complementary, and compatible with the principle of divergent thinking. In my experience, the most effective and obedient home or visiting teachers are the ones who break from the standard script. They use creativity to serve the needs of their families.</p>
<p>Thinking divergently about your testimony offers the chance to escape the familiar ruts and tired patterns of Church membership. If Church life is stale, it is time to disrupt your routine. Try home teaching on the <i>first</i> day of the month. Say one prayer without resorting to vain repetition. Sing harmony this Sunday instead of the melody, and do it as loud as you dare. Rather than say you know the Church is true when you might not, bear your testimony of a single point of doctrine that you do know is true.</p>
<h2><b>Prototype Early to Succeed Sooner</b></h2>
<p>After hovering in the ideation phase for as long as possible, we eventually converge upon our best ideas in the prototype and testing phase. Learning from mistakes and failures, we apply the knowledge to our next iteration; consequently, the veil gets thinner. By its very nature a prototype signifies a work in progress and implies that we will fail. To the experienced design thinker, failure is only temporary; it is simply part of the process. Henry Ford said, "Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again."<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>In his journal Joseph Smith described himself as "a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else."<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>What did Joseph mean? He was undergoing user testing. His ideas were in the rapid prototyping department. He was a work in progress.</p>
<p>After the Lord has shown you line upon line, precept upon precept, He promises to "try you and prove you herewith" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12?lang=eng#p11">D&amp;C 98:12</a>). Bills growth in the Church came incrementally. His leadership skills were prototyped and tested as he served as the first presiding elder, branch president, and finally bishop of Mud Lake - a position he held for ten years. When the time finally came to build a chapel, the work fell to local ward members. Since they were all farmers, they could only work on the building during the cold winter months. As the building neared completion, a date for its dedication was set.</p>
<p>But in the rush to finish, my grandfather realized in horror that they had forgotten to budget for chairs or pews, and the congregation was completely out of money. Faced with the approaching deadline, he remembered a coffee can sitting on the top shelf in his kitchen at home. To earn money for new winter coats, the children had cared for a new crop of bum lambs all summer and had just sold them at market. The tin can contained all their hard-earned money. The Shuldberg family quietly took the can down, consecrated their offering to the Lord, and bought chairs for the new chapel.</p>
<p>With their prototyping and test complete, a promised blessing now awaited them. Aleda made over their old winter coats and they attended the dedication, sitting in new chairs that others barely noticed. On the day of the dedication, the apostle Joseph F. Merrill came from Salt Lake City to offer the dedicatory prayer. Unaware that the farmers usually ran out of irrigation water long before the growing season was over, he blessed the stunned members that there would always be sufficient water for their crops. Shortly thereafter one of the largest underground aquifers in the United States was discovered below Mud Lake.</p>
<p>In the words of Alma:</p>
<p><i>And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet . . . ; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.42?lang=eng#p41">Alma 32:42</a>]</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>By applying basic principles of design and gospel thinking, we can accept Almas advice to experiment upon the word. Like the braided rug made with Aledas scraps of fabric, a testimony only becomes durable and resilient when the small, individual experiences of gospel living are woven together. What was once discarded, worn, and insignificant on its own can offer great strength and comfort in the face of wicked problems.</p>
<p>So when the trial of your faith or any other wicked problem comes, remember to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embrace doubt and uncertainty as essential elements in problem solving. Let them motivate you to seek greater understanding.</li>
<li>Remember that a testimony as well as knowledge are built line upon line. Rather than focusing on what may seem like an unreachable goal, incremental development comes from small, well-placed steps.</li>
<li>If chance favors the prepared mind, your preparation will come through <i>immersing</i> yourself in Church life rather than through <i>dabbling</i> in it.</li>
<li>If gospel living has become routine and uninspiring or if you feel stuck with a problem, look to change your perspective through divergent gospel thinking.</li>
<li>Finally, growth in your testimony comes only through the tests and trials of life. Prototype early and often to succeed sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p>From my own personal experience, if you have even a desire to believe, the seed of testimony can grow and take root within your heart. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many who speak at a Brigham Young University devotional make reference to their experiences as students at BYU and the insights they have gained by attending devotionals. I cant do that because I never attended BYU. I am a Utah State University Aggie, and my Aggie blue runs deep. I am a big Cougar fan, but even after twenty years of holding season tickets for BYU basketball and football, I still cant bring myself to sing, "Rise and shout."
In those same twenty years I have also attended devotionals as a faculty member and have heard the testimonies of many of my colleagues and felt the spirit of many students as they have borne testimony through music. I am particularly humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today in a place where prophets and apostles have taught and testified.
Do We Really Believe in the Resurrection?
I am the youngest in a family of four boys, and about twenty-two years ago I was encouraged to apply for a faculty opening here at BYU in the Department of Mathematics. At the time, I was a faculty member at Oregon State University, and my three older brothers lived in Iowa, Washington, and California, while my parents lived in Logan, Utah. In addition to this being a great opportunity for me to come to BYU, it allowed me to be a little closer to my parents, because their health was failing.
My father did not want my decision to move to Utah to be based in any way on helping him and my mother. He was very proud of the fact that his sons were contributing to the kingdom outside of Utah. My wife, Shauna, and I felt that the move to BYU was the right decision, and we arrived here in August 1996.
Six months after our arrival in Provo, my father had surgery in Salt Lake City to repair a heart valve. Ten years earlier his original valve had been replaced with a pig valve, at which time he contracted hepatitis C. Because this pig valve was now failing, the doctors decided to replace it with a mechanical valve. During the surgery the doctors realized that the hepatitis C had wreaked havoc on my fathers liver, which made the heart surgery very traumatic on his body. This was the beginning of a seventeen-day roller coaster ride.
At this time my mothers health was not good, so she was only able to visit my dad about every two to three days. Thus the responsibility of visiting my father and communicating with the doctors fell to my wife and me. One or the other of us would travel from Mapleton, about ten miles south of Provo, to the hospital in Salt Lake City every day. Many times my wife would visit in the afternoon, and I would spend the evening at the hospital, or vice versa. This was particularly challenging because we had four children ranging in age from three to nine.
I referred to this time as a roller coaster ride because on one day a particular doctor would be pessimistic and on the next day another doctor would be optimistic about the eventual outcome.</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, President Worthen, for the nice introduction. President Worthen mentioned that I graduated from the University of Utah. If that fact troubles any of you because of the long-standing sports rivalry, let me put your mind at ease. I recently received a very nice thank-you note from a graduating student. After saying lots of nice things, he concluded his note by saying, "Despite the fact that you graduated from the U, I think youre a great guy." So dont worry: I am a great guy, and I am thrilled to be here at BYU with so many great students and colleagues. I hope each of you feels that way too.
The World Is a Dangerous Place
Last week I had a great time with my son Tate and the rest of the priests and teachers from our ward on their annual high adventure trip. Among other things, we kayaked on the Green River and mountain biked in the La Sal Mountains. One of the highlights of the trip was rappelling down a 175-foot cliff below a double arch. Dont get the wrong impression; I am not a great adventurer and I am definitely not an experienced climber. I have always had a fear of heights, and before last week I had never rappelled. As I started the descent, the engineer in me started to think about how ropes can fray and carabiners can break. I know my fears were irrational, but there is some inherent danger in rappelling. Maybe a little healthy fear is a good thing if it helps me stay safe.
Rappelling isnt the only dangerous thing in the world. In fact, the world is basically a dangerous place. Here are some numbers from an article I read some years ago that illustrate what I mean:

You have a one in 11 million risk of dying from an earthquake or volcano.
There is a one in 12 million chance you will die from leaking gas.
You have a one in 6 million probability of being injured in an elevator ride.
There is a one in 23 million chance that you will die from drinking detergent.
Your risk of being infected with flesh-eating bacteria is one in 170,000.
You have a one in 11,000 chance of being murdered, a one in 400 chance of being robbed, and a one in fifty chance of being burglarized.
Certain risks depend on where you are born. For example, in the United States you have a one in 100 chance of dying before the age of five. In South Asia, on the other hand, you have one chance in eight.
Other risks have to do with whether you are a man or a woman. For example, men are 2.3 times as likely to die in a car crash and 3.3 times as likely to accidentally poison themselves than are women.
Women in the United States, on the other hand, have a one in 12,500 chance of dying in childbirth.
Im sure some of you have wondered this: what are your chances of being struck by lightning this year? The answer is one in 750,000.
And, finally, a piece of good news: What are the odds that you will be hit by a meteor? O</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My father was a builder of big buildings, some well known. So when I returned from my two-year mission to Japan and wanted summer work, I ended up forty feet down at the bottom of an air conditioning shaft, stripping forms from freshly poured concrete. My captive coworker, Chuck, made the mistake of asking why I would "waste two valuable years like that." I am sure he had no idea what he was in for, and I unleashed my abundance of missionary zeal.
At some point in our discussion I heard a noise overhead and saw the familiar silhouette of my father leaning over the shaft. What he said was a surprise: "Chuck, I dont know what hes saying down there, but I believe it is true. Now get back to work."
This is for me the most treasured testimony my father bore, but I hope we can surpass that level of communication today. I dont want you to go back to class thinking, "I dont know what he was saying down there, but I believe it is true." Instead I want to persuade you to rethink the way you communicate to others your feelings about your connections to heaven and the amazing blessings of what you know and what you feel.
Why persuade? Because "no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood" - and I hold no position that grants me that kind of dominion over you anyway - "only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;C 121:41). I want to persuade you to consider another perspective that will help you follow the counsel of an apostle.
Elder David A. Bednar stood here in August and asked us "to sweep the earth as with a flood of truth and righteousness" in our online efforts ("To Sweep the Earth as with a Flood," BYU Education Week devotional address, 19 August 2014, lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/to-sweep-the-earth-as-with-a-flood). His devotional was historic in many ways. I was so delighted.
Elder Bednars first qualification for this effort was simple:
We are disciples, and our messages should be authentic. A person or product that is not authentic is false, fake, and fraudulent. Our messages should be truthful, honest, and accurate. We should not exaggerate, embellish, or pretend to be someone or something we are not. ["To Sweep the Earth"]
Following his counsel to be authentic will be more difficult for us, as central-culture Mormons, because for decades we have desired to honor the Lord by always putting our best foot forward. Look down at your feet, if you will. The problem is that nearly every mortal has two feet, and most require both of those feet to stand properly.
Over the past ten years I have regularly had the punishment and privilege of watching through a one-way mirror as focus groups discuss Mormons. The people in these groups were not just any people; they were selected for these sessions because their beliefs and actions demo</span>

We love and respect President Samuelson, a valued colleague and friend, and his dear Sharon. As we consider the intellectual, leadership, and (most important) spiritual abilities of President Samuelson and those who administratively assist him, we know you are extraordinarily well led at this university. We love BYU. It is a lustrous jewel in the crown of the Church.
I wish to offer a brief insight into my life experience to provide some personal context for the subject I will address today. I was born in Hawaii when it was a territory of the United States, 10 years before statehood. Raised in the islands in a multicultural environment, I left for higher education on this campus and then for a mission to England. After marriage to a Canadian girl and our graduations here at this university, we returned to Hawaii to raise our family.
My father first went to Hawaii in 1940 as a young missionary for the Church. He was there when the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor violently thrust the U.S. into war. He served three years as a missionary, went home to Salt Lake City, and joined the army. After boot camp and officer candidate school, he married my mother in the Salt Lake Temple, and they were stationed in Hawaii. They spent the remainder of the war on Oahu in a tiny cottage with the windows painted black so no light would shine through as a protection against enemy bombers. In 1945 they returned to Salt Lake City, stayed nine months, and then returned to Hawaii as a permanent home. My mother passed away in 2001, and my father died last year - both in Hawaii. When my father died, it had been nearly 70 years since he first arrived in the islands. I treasure my upbringing in culturally diverse Hawaii; it has significantly influenced my perspective of the equality of Gods children.
Ten years ago, after receiving my call as a General Authority, my wife, Diane, and I were assigned to the Asia North Area, which then comprised the countries of Japan and South Korea and included doing humanitarian work in North Korea. We lived in Tokyo and stayed three years in that assignment. After two years at Church headquarters, we then were sent to the Churchs Asia Area, which encompasses 25 countries and territories and over one-half the worlds population. After four years of living in Hong Kong, we have now been back at Church headquarters for nearly a year and a half. In my current assignment we assist the Quorum of the Twelve in supervising the Church throughout the world.
With this growing perspective of the people of the world, heightened by the fundamental purpose of my ecclesiastical responsibilities, I have spent much time pondering how the gospel is established in an individual lif</span>
