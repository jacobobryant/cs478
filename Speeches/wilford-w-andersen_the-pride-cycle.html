  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;It has been said that a good talk will always comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. As you listen this morning, you might consider which of those two applies to you. If my message accomplishes either of these two results, I will feel it has been worthwhile. I have prayed that the Holy Ghost will carry my words to your hearts and that you will then apply them in a way that will bless your lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;There is a prevalent pattern of behavior in the Book of Mormon commonly referred to as “the pride cycle.” It is repeated so frequently that one begins to sense that the Lord and His prophets are trying to teach us something important—that perhaps its inclusion in the record is meant to be a warning from the Lord to each of us in our day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Pride is a serious sin. In fact, in the book of Proverbs we read that it is number one on the list of seven deadly sins that the Lord hates.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Using a clock as a metaphor, let’s say that the pride cycle begins at twelve o’clock—the pinnacle of pride. When we are at twelve o’clock on the pride cycle, we, like the Nephites of old, feel so successful, so intelligent, and so popular that we begin to feel invincible. We enjoy it when others compliment us on our successes, and we are irritated when others around us receive compliments on their ­successes. At twelve o’clock we tend not to listen to the counsel of others. We don’t need others. Sadly, we often conclude that we don’t even need God or His servants. We bristle at their counsel. We are doing just fine on our own. We forget or we reject what King Benjamin taught: that we “are eternally indebted to [our] heavenly Father, to render to him all that [we] have and are.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Our modern-day prophets have warned us against unrighteous pride. President Ezra Taft Benson called it “the universal sin” and “the great stumbling block to Zion.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; President Dieter F. Uchtdorf compared pride to “a personal Rameumptom, a holy stand that justifies envy, greed, and vanity.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; However you define pride, its consequences are always the same. It alienates us from God. It pushes us around the pride cycle to two o’clock, where we offend the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Initially we may think that offending the Spirit of the Holy Ghost is inconsequential. Nephi described it as being “lull[ed] . . . away into carnal security. . . . All is well in Zion [we think]; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well.”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Interestingly, at two o’clock on the pride cycle, if we are honest with ourselves, we really are not that happy. We have this gnawing sense that we are slipping. We try to fight back against the uncomfortable currents of the pride cycle. We cling to the memories of past successes and insist on putting our trust in the arm of flesh. This is a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Jesus taught that you and I are like branches that depend on the vine for nourishment. “I am the vine,” He taught, “ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; When we offend the Spirit, we cut ourselves off from the very source of all spiritual nourishment, and it is just a matter of time until we begin to wilt. Without the help of the Lord and the influence of the Spirit, the gravitational pull of the pride cycle drags us down toward four o’clock failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The Lord taught Joseph Smith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For although a man may .&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;. have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We can choose our conduct, but we cannot choose the consequences of our conduct. At four o’clock on the pride cycle, we experience the painful consequences of our foolish pride. We may lose the job. We may lose the girlfriend or the boyfriend. We may lose the respect of those who matter most to us. Worse yet, we may lose respect for ourselves. Time has a way of relegating the most important among us from the list of Who’s Who to the list of Who’s He? or Who’s She? And at four o’clock we come face to face with our own inadequacies. Like Moses, we realize that we are not so important after all, “which thing [we] never had supposed.”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The great English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a thought-provoking poem entitled “Ozymandias,” in which he told of “a traveler from an antique land” who happened upon the ancient remains of a once-imposing stone statue. All that remained of the statue were two “trunkless legs,” a shattered, half-buried head, and a pedestal with an inscription that read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The lone and level sands stretch far away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; Failures and afflictions are not happy thoughts for any of us, but, ironically, we often find that they are great blessings because they tend to push us on around the pride cycle toward six o’clock humility. Our journey from four o’clock failure to six o’clock humility can be strangely exhilarating. We begin to lose our pretensions. We are no longer trying to impress those around us. We begin to see things more clearly and more honestly. We are more comfortable with criticism and can smile at our own mistakes and weaknesses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;At six o’clock on the pride cycle, it is not, as one Christian author has observed, that we think less of ourselves but rather that we think of ourselves less.10 The British writer G. K. Chesterton described the transition brilliantly when he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it. .&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;. You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;At six o’clock on the pride cycle, we become truly humble. We also become meek. Humility and meekness are foundational principles of the gospel. We speak often of the great triumvirate of Christian virtues: faith, hope, and charity. But the prophet Mormon suggested that there is a fourth virtue that makes possible the other three. He taught:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Another scriptural attribute often ­associated with six o’clock humility is submissiveness. King Benjamin taught that the natural man is an enemy to God and will be forever and ever unless he becomes as a little “child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We can learn much about humility and meekness from little children. They seem to spend much of their little lives at six o’clock on the cycle. They are comfortable there. No wonder the Lord teaches us that in order to come into His presence, we must become as little children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;One of our sons and his wife were struggling with contention and disunity among their children in their home. After counseling together, they decided that pride was the cause. They held a family council on the matter with their children and determined together that humility is what the children needed to eliminate the contention and disunity. To help their children remember to be kind, my son and daughter-in-law placed a chair in the corner of the kitchen and designated it as “the humility chair.” When a child misbehaved or became upset, they would invite him to sit in the humility chair for a while until he could reflect and recalibrate. Then he could rejoin society whenever he was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The humility chair worked as they had hoped it would. One day after our son had returned from a long, hard day at work and had displayed some impatience with several of the children, who were yelling and running through the house, one of his little daughters looked at him and said, “Papa, you need to sit in the humility chair”—which he did. He reflected, recalibrated, and rejoined society when he was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Each of us would be wise to designate a humility chair—if not in the corner of the kitchen, perhaps in the corner of our minds and hearts—where we can recalibrate and remember our dependence on the Lord. Partaking of the sacrament each week provides just such an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We should not make the mistake, however, of confusing meekness with weakness. It has been said that meekness is not a recognition of our weakness but rather a recognition of the &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; source of our strength. There is nothing weak about meek. It is just that when we are humble and meek, we don’t elevate ourselves; we elevate God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;David, the young shepherd boy, was sent by his father to deliver food to his older brothers who were fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah. When David got to the Israelite camp and learned of the challenge from the giant Goliath, he offered to represent the armies of Israel and fight the giant himself. While his brothers ridiculed him, David meekly explained to King Saul that “the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Something in David’s meek demeanor must have impressed King Saul, because he responded, “Go, and the Lord be with thee.”&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;So David confronted the giant, who was furious that the Israelites would send a shepherd boy to fight him. He called out to David:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Then, with a sling and one small stone, the meek shepherd boy, David, killed the proud giant Goliath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;You and I live in a society in which humility and meekness seem almost counterintuitive. Trash talk, power politics, and end-zone victory dances are celebrated while noiseless devotion to God is increasingly ignored and even at times belittled. But let us never forget, brothers and sisters, that humility and meekness are required if we wish to continue our progress around the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;At six o’clock on the pride cycle, when we are truly humble and meek, we turn back to God because there is often nowhere else to turn. Our hearts are now broken and our spirits are ­contrite. The world defines “broken hearted” as being overcome by grief or despair—something to be avoided if at all possible. But in the scriptures, having a broken heart is a peaceful and hopeful condition and ultimately a prerequisite to eternal glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Consider this perspective on what it means to have a broken heart. To break a horse is to train a horse how to be ridden. A broken horse accepts the saddle strapped to its back, the reins placed around its head with the bit in its mouth, and a rider in the saddle. A broken horse has learned through experience how to obey and be responsive to the guidance given by the rider. Only then can a horse be useful and productive. And so it is with a broken heart; a broken heart is one that has been trained through experience to be obedient and responsive to the commands of the Master. Only with a broken heart can we be truly useful and productive in the Lord’s service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;At six o’clock we yield our broken hearts to God, and because we are humble, the Lord begins to “lead [us] by the hand, and give [us] answer to [our] prayers.”&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; With His guidance, we continue around the pride cycle toward eight o’clock, when we invite the Spirit of the Holy Ghost into our lives once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The Spirit’s influence changes our hearts. Like the people of King Mosiah, “we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.”&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; We begin to keep God’s commandments, and He begins to pour down His blessings upon us—blessings that He has always desired to give us, for that is His nature, but that we refused to receive because of our foolish pride. We begin to receive blessings because we are now obeying the laws upon which they are predicated. We pay our tithing, and the Lord opens the windows of heaven and pours down so many blessings that we cannot receive them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Our humble obedience to the commandments powers our progress around the pride cycle toward ten o’clock, when we find ourselves in a state of blessed happiness. We experience success. It should not surprise us; it is a scriptural promise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; Ten o’clock on the pride cycle is a pleasant and wonderful place to be, but unfortunately it is also a very dangerous place to be. Our associates begin to pat us on the back and to compliment us for all our successes. Unfortunately, we begin to believe them. When I was called to serve as a General Authority, President Uchtdorf reminded me of some timely advice he had received at the time of his call.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;“Brother Andersen,” I was told, “as a General Authority, people will be very kind to you. They will compliment you on your service and tell you how much they like your conference talks. But when they do, just don’t inhale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Compliments can be like a drug. If we are not careful, they can cloud our judgment and ­create in us an ungodly desire for more and more praise and credit. And if our friends don’t give us the credit we so richly deserve, we risk rotator cuff injury from trying to pat ourselves on the back. Like our ancient adversary, we whisper to ourselves that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; deserve the credit, for surely we have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; . . . yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Slowly—and without fully realizing it—we once again approach the twelve o’clock pinnacle of pride, so busy looking around for accolades that we fail to look ahead at the precipitous fall that awaits us. For “pride [always] goeth . . . before a fall.”&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; And so the incessant cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Brothers and sisters, let’s be honest. Most of us, like the Nephites of old, have ourselves taken a few laps around the pride cycle. I used to wonder how the Nephite nation could run the entire cycle in a period of as short as five years. I have since come to believe that we can run the cycle in five years and we can run it in five minutes. It is a pernicious pattern of thinking and behavior that permeates our society. It is so common that it sometimes becomes hard to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Are we consigned to continue forever in this endless do-loop of despair? Is there no way to get off the pride cycle? There is. In fact, there are two points on the pride cycle where we can exit—one to our eternal destruction and the other to our everlasting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; At four o’clock, when we are facing failure or affliction and feel like all is lost, if instead of becoming humble we become angry; if we lose hope or give in to self-pity; or if we begin to blame others—including God—for our misfortune, then we will exit the pride cycle. But we will exit downward to destruction, as did the Nephites of old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;But at ten o’clock, when it seems like we can do no wrong, when all is going well, if instead of becoming proud we become thankful, then we will exit the pride cycle. But this time we will exit upward toward God. To exit the pride cycle at ten o’clock, we must recognize that every blessing we receive comes from Heavenly Father. He is the source of all that is good in our lives—the fount of every blessing. We must embrace King Benjamin’s teaching that we “all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind.”&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; A successful ten-o’clock escape from the ­power­ful pull of the pride cycle is not easy, but it is possible. We have a few examples in the Nephite record to prove it. Consider this one from Alma 62:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves exceedingly before him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions, and he had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and prosper in the land.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;As we speak, each of us likely finds himself or herself somewhere on the pride cycle. Where are you? If you are at four o’clock, if it feels like all is lost and you are a total failure, don’t despair. You are in a good place. Avoid blaming others for your failure. Humbly turn to God and recognize your dependency on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The gravitational pull of the pride cycle will draw you on around to a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;But if you are at ten o’clock, basking in the false light of success, be careful. Avoid the tendency to turn inward and become prideful. “Count your many blessings; name them one by one.”&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Follow the scriptural counsel to remember all that the Lord has done for you. As the sacramental prayer reminds us, we must remember Him not for an hour or two but always.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; We must not take Him or His sacrifice for granted. We must not fail to thank Him for each and every blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The story is told of an elderly grandmother who was walking along the seashore with her little grandson when a giant wave swept in, picked up her grandson, and carried him out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The grandmother looked up to heaven and cried, “Lord, how could you do this to me? I pay my tithing, I fast once each month, and I live the Word of Wisdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt; Before the grandmother could say amen, another giant wave swept in and delivered her grandson at her feet. She looked down at the boy, then up to heaven, and said, “Wait! He had a hat.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Recognize that all good things come from God. He is the source of every blessing you receive. Fill your heart with gratitude for His merciful kindness. Treasure and follow the counsel of His servants. Your gratitude will inoculate you against pride and make a way for your escape from the pride cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Brothers and sisters, you are important to the kingdom of God. You are the hope of Israel, Zion’s army, the children of the promised day. Please be wise. May we each heed the prophetic warning of the Nephite pride cycle.&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

			<p class="p1">It has been said that a good talk will always comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. As you listen this morning, you might consider which of those two applies to you. If my message accomplishes either of these two results, I will feel it has been worthwhile. I have prayed that the Holy Ghost will carry my words to your hearts and that you will then apply them in a way that will bless your lives.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a prevalent pattern of behavior in the Book of Mormon commonly referred to as “the pride cycle.” It is repeated so frequently that one begins to sense that the Lord and His prophets are trying to teach us something important—that perhaps its inclusion in the record is meant to be a warning from the Lord to each of us in our day.</p>
<p class="p1">Pride is a serious sin. In fact, in the book of Proverbs we read that it is number one on the list of seven deadly sins that the Lord hates.<sup>1</sup> Using a clock as a metaphor, let’s say that the pride cycle begins at twelve o’clock—the pinnacle of pride. When we are at twelve o’clock on the pride cycle, we, like the Nephites of old, feel so successful, so intelligent, and so popular that we begin to feel invincible. We enjoy it when others compliment us on our successes, and we are irritated when others around us receive compliments on their ­successes. At twelve o’clock we tend not to listen to the counsel of others. We don’t need others. Sadly, we often conclude that we don’t even need God or His servants. We bristle at their counsel. We are doing just fine on our own. We forget or we reject what King Benjamin taught: that we “are eternally indebted to [our] heavenly Father, to render to him all that [we] have and are.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="p1">Our modern-day prophets have warned us against unrighteous pride. President Ezra Taft Benson called it “the universal sin” and “the great stumbling block to Zion.”<sup>3</sup> President Dieter F. Uchtdorf compared pride to “a personal Rameumptom, a holy stand that justifies envy, greed, and vanity.”<sup>4</sup> However you define pride, its consequences are always the same. It alienates us from God. It pushes us around the pride cycle to two o’clock, where we offend the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="p1">Initially we may think that offending the Spirit of the Holy Ghost is inconsequential. Nephi described it as being “lull[ed] . . . away into carnal security. . . . All is well in Zion [we think]; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well.”<sup>5</sup> Interestingly, at two o’clock on the pride cycle, if we are honest with ourselves, we really are not that happy. We have this gnawing sense that we are slipping. We try to fight back against the uncomfortable currents of the pride cycle. We cling to the memories of past successes and insist on putting our trust in the arm of flesh. This is a serious mistake.</p>
<p class="p1">Jesus taught that you and I are like branches that depend on the vine for nourishment. “I am the vine,” He taught, “ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.”<sup>6</sup> When we offend the Spirit, we cut ourselves off from the very source of all spiritual nourishment, and it is just a matter of time until we begin to wilt. Without the help of the Lord and the influence of the Spirit, the gravitational pull of the pride cycle drags us down toward four o’clock failure.</p>
<p class="p1">The Lord taught Joseph Smith:</p>
<p class="p1"><i>For although a man may .</i> <i>.</i> <i>. have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall.</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p class="p1">We can choose our conduct, but we cannot choose the consequences of our conduct. At four o’clock on the pride cycle, we experience the painful consequences of our foolish pride. We may lose the job. We may lose the girlfriend or the boyfriend. We may lose the respect of those who matter most to us. Worse yet, we may lose respect for ourselves. Time has a way of relegating the most important among us from the list of Who’s Who to the list of Who’s He? or Who’s She? And at four o’clock we come face to face with our own inadequacies. Like Moses, we realize that we are not so important after all, “which thing [we] never had supposed.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p class="p1">The great English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a thought-provoking poem entitled “Ozymandias,” in which he told of “a traveler from an antique land” who happened upon the ancient remains of a once-imposing stone statue. All that remained of the statue were two “trunkless legs,” a shattered, half-buried head, and a pedestal with an inscription that read:</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br />
</i><i>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”<br />
</i><i>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
</i><i>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br />
</i><i>The lone and level sands stretch far away.</i><sup>9</sup></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Failures and afflictions are not happy thoughts for any of us, but, ironically, we often find that they are great blessings because they tend to push us on around the pride cycle toward six o’clock humility. Our journey from four o’clock failure to six o’clock humility can be strangely exhilarating. We begin to lose our pretensions. We are no longer trying to impress those around us. We begin to see things more clearly and more honestly. We are more comfortable with criticism and can smile at our own mistakes and weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1">At six o’clock on the pride cycle, it is not, as one Christian author has observed, that we think less of ourselves but rather that we think of ourselves less.10 The British writer G. K. Chesterton described the transition brilliantly when he wrote:</p>
<p class="p1"><i>How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it. .</i> <i>.</i> <i>. You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers.</i><sup>11</sup></p>
<p class="p1">At six o’clock on the pride cycle, we become truly humble. We also become meek. Humility and meekness are foundational principles of the gospel. We speak often of the great triumvirate of Christian virtues: faith, hope, and charity. But the prophet Mormon suggested that there is a fourth virtue that makes possible the other three. He taught:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"> <i>And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><i>If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p class="p1">Another scriptural attribute often ­associated with six o’clock humility is submissiveness. King Benjamin taught that the natural man is an enemy to God and will be forever and ever unless he becomes as a little “child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.”<sup>13</sup></p>
<p class="p1">We can learn much about humility and meekness from little children. They seem to spend much of their little lives at six o’clock on the cycle. They are comfortable there. No wonder the Lord teaches us that in order to come into His presence, we must become as little children.</p>
<p class="p1">One of our sons and his wife were struggling with contention and disunity among their children in their home. After counseling together, they decided that pride was the cause. They held a family council on the matter with their children and determined together that humility is what the children needed to eliminate the contention and disunity. To help their children remember to be kind, my son and daughter-in-law placed a chair in the corner of the kitchen and designated it as “the humility chair.” When a child misbehaved or became upset, they would invite him to sit in the humility chair for a while until he could reflect and recalibrate. Then he could rejoin society whenever he was ready.</p>
<p class="p1">The humility chair worked as they had hoped it would. One day after our son had returned from a long, hard day at work and had displayed some impatience with several of the children, who were yelling and running through the house, one of his little daughters looked at him and said, “Papa, you need to sit in the humility chair”—which he did. He reflected, recalibrated, and rejoined society when he was ready.</p>
<p class="p1">Each of us would be wise to designate a humility chair—if not in the corner of the kitchen, perhaps in the corner of our minds and hearts—where we can recalibrate and remember our dependence on the Lord. Partaking of the sacrament each week provides just such an opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1">We should not make the mistake, however, of confusing meekness with weakness. It has been said that meekness is not a recognition of our weakness but rather a recognition of the <i>true</i> source of our strength. There is nothing weak about meek. It is just that when we are humble and meek, we don’t elevate ourselves; we elevate God.</p>
<p class="p1">David, the young shepherd boy, was sent by his father to deliver food to his older brothers who were fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah. When David got to the Israelite camp and learned of the challenge from the giant Goliath, he offered to represent the armies of Israel and fight the giant himself. While his brothers ridiculed him, David meekly explained to King Saul that “the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.”</p>
<p class="p1">Something in David’s meek demeanor must have impressed King Saul, because he responded, “Go, and the Lord be with thee.”<sup>14</sup></p>
<p class="p1">So David confronted the giant, who was furious that the Israelites would send a shepherd boy to fight him. He called out to David:</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand.</i><sup>15</sup></p>
<p class="p1">Then, with a sling and one small stone, the meek shepherd boy, David, killed the proud giant Goliath.</p>
<p class="p1">You and I live in a society in which humility and meekness seem almost counterintuitive. Trash talk, power politics, and end-zone victory dances are celebrated while noiseless devotion to God is increasingly ignored and even at times belittled. But let us never forget, brothers and sisters, that humility and meekness are required if we wish to continue our progress around the cycle.</p>
<p class="p1">At six o’clock on the pride cycle, when we are truly humble and meek, we turn back to God because there is often nowhere else to turn. Our hearts are now broken and our spirits are ­contrite. The world defines “broken hearted” as being overcome by grief or despair—something to be avoided if at all possible. But in the scriptures, having a broken heart is a peaceful and hopeful condition and ultimately a prerequisite to eternal glory.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider this perspective on what it means to have a broken heart. To break a horse is to train a horse how to be ridden. A broken horse accepts the saddle strapped to its back, the reins placed around its head with the bit in its mouth, and a rider in the saddle. A broken horse has learned through experience how to obey and be responsive to the guidance given by the rider. Only then can a horse be useful and productive. And so it is with a broken heart; a broken heart is one that has been trained through experience to be obedient and responsive to the commands of the Master. Only with a broken heart can we be truly useful and productive in the Lord’s service.</p>
<p class="p1">At six o’clock we yield our broken hearts to God, and because we are humble, the Lord begins to “lead [us] by the hand, and give [us] answer to [our] prayers.”<sup>16</sup> With His guidance, we continue around the pride cycle toward eight o’clock, when we invite the Spirit of the Holy Ghost into our lives once again.</p>
<p class="p1">The Spirit’s influence changes our hearts. Like the people of King Mosiah, “we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.”<sup>17</sup> We begin to keep God’s commandments, and He begins to pour down His blessings upon us—blessings that He has always desired to give us, for that is His nature, but that we refused to receive because of our foolish pride. We begin to receive blessings because we are now obeying the laws upon which they are predicated. We pay our tithing, and the Lord opens the windows of heaven and pours down so many blessings that we cannot receive them all.</p>
<p class="p1">Our humble obedience to the commandments powers our progress around the pride cycle toward ten o’clock, when we find ourselves in a state of blessed happiness. We experience success. It should not surprise us; it is a scriptural promise:</p>
<p class="p1"><i>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual.</i><sup>18</sup></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"> Ten o’clock on the pride cycle is a pleasant and wonderful place to be, but unfortunately it is also a very dangerous place to be. Our associates begin to pat us on the back and to compliment us for all our successes. Unfortunately, we begin to believe them. When I was called to serve as a General Authority, President Uchtdorf reminded me of some timely advice he had received at the time of his call.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“Brother Andersen,” I was told, “as a General Authority, people will be very kind to you. They will compliment you on your service and tell you how much they like your conference talks. But when they do, just don’t inhale.”</p>
<p class="p1">Compliments can be like a drug. If we are not careful, they can cloud our judgment and ­create in us an ungodly desire for more and more praise and credit. And if our friends don’t give us the credit we so richly deserve, we risk rotator cuff injury from trying to pat ourselves on the back. Like our ancient adversary, we whisper to ourselves that <i>we</i> deserve the credit, for surely we have done it.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; . . . yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</i><sup>19</sup></p>
<p class="p1">Slowly—and without fully realizing it—we once again approach the twelve o’clock pinnacle of pride, so busy looking around for accolades that we fail to look ahead at the precipitous fall that awaits us. For “pride [always] goeth . . . before a fall.”<sup>20</sup> And so the incessant cycle continues.</p>
<p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, let’s be honest. Most of us, like the Nephites of old, have ourselves taken a few laps around the pride cycle. I used to wonder how the Nephite nation could run the entire cycle in a period of as short as five years. I have since come to believe that we can run the cycle in five years and we can run it in five minutes. It is a pernicious pattern of thinking and behavior that permeates our society. It is so common that it sometimes becomes hard to recognize.</p>
<p class="p1">Are we consigned to continue forever in this endless do-loop of despair? Is there no way to get off the pride cycle? There is. In fact, there are two points on the pride cycle where we can exit—one to our eternal destruction and the other to our everlasting happiness.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> At four o’clock, when we are facing failure or affliction and feel like all is lost, if instead of becoming humble we become angry; if we lose hope or give in to self-pity; or if we begin to blame others—including God—for our misfortune, then we will exit the pride cycle. But we will exit downward to destruction, as did the Nephites of old.</span></p>
<p class="p1">But at ten o’clock, when it seems like we can do no wrong, when all is going well, if instead of becoming proud we become thankful, then we will exit the pride cycle. But this time we will exit upward toward God. To exit the pride cycle at ten o’clock, we must recognize that every blessing we receive comes from Heavenly Father. He is the source of all that is good in our lives—the fount of every blessing. We must embrace King Benjamin’s teaching that we “all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind.”<sup>21</sup></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A successful ten-o’clock escape from the ­power­ful pull of the pride cycle is not easy, but it is possible. We have a few examples in the Nephite record to prove it. Consider this one from Alma 62:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><i>But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves exceedingly before him.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions, and he had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and prosper in the land.</i><sup>22</sup></p>
<p class="p1">As we speak, each of us likely finds himself or herself somewhere on the pride cycle. Where are you? If you are at four o’clock, if it feels like all is lost and you are a total failure, don’t despair. You are in a good place. Avoid blaming others for your failure. Humbly turn to God and recognize your dependency on Him.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i><sup>23</sup></p>
<p class="p1">The gravitational pull of the pride cycle will draw you on around to a brighter future.</p>
<p class="p1">But if you are at ten o’clock, basking in the false light of success, be careful. Avoid the tendency to turn inward and become prideful. “Count your many blessings; name them one by one.”<sup>24</sup> Follow the scriptural counsel to remember all that the Lord has done for you. As the sacramental prayer reminds us, we must remember Him not for an hour or two but always.<sup>25</sup> We must not take Him or His sacrifice for granted. We must not fail to thank Him for each and every blessing.</p>
<p class="p1">The story is told of an elderly grandmother who was walking along the seashore with her little grandson when a giant wave swept in, picked up her grandson, and carried him out to sea.</p>
<p class="p1">The grandmother looked up to heaven and cried, “Lord, how could you do this to me? I pay my tithing, I fast once each month, and I live the Word of Wisdom.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Before the grandmother could say amen, another giant wave swept in and delivered her grandson at her feet. She looked down at the boy, then up to heaven, and said, “Wait! He had a hat.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">Recognize that all good things come from God. He is the source of every blessing you receive. Fill your heart with gratitude for His merciful kindness. Treasure and follow the counsel of His servants. Your gratitude will inoculate you against pride and make a way for your escape from the pride cycle.</p>
<p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, you are important to the kingdom of God. You are the hope of Israel, Zion’s army, the children of the promised day. Please be wise. May we each heed the prophetic warning of the Nephite pride cycle.<sup>26</sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, it is nice to be with you. You are an amazing sight. Being here today reminds me of an experience I had a few years ago. Sister Cook and I were asked to speak in another university setting, and when my mother-in-law heard about it, she said, “Oh, aren’t you scared?”
Actually, I was a little scared, but feeling somewhat curious, I asked her, “Why should I be scared?”
She said, “Because students are so intelligent!”
That was a nice compliment for the students, but it didn’t say much for what my mother-in-law thought of me and my intelligence!
Today I realize that I am speaking to a group of very intelligent and educated people, but I am not scared, because the topic I would like to address is applicable to each of us in a very personal way. It is how we can put off the natural man or the natural woman and become Saints through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. This is something I have been working on for many years—battling with the natural man. But I am determined to never relax, retreat, or retire from the fight.
Putting Off the Natural Man or Woman
The natural man or woman is the mortal part of us that allows the physical, the temporal, or our own desires to overrule our inherent spiritual goodness and our desires to become like our Heavenly Parents (see Spencer W. Kimball, “Ocean Currents and Family Influences,” Ensign, November 1974). Of course the fight will not be won immediately. It is a daily battle for each of us, and we are dependent upon God and Jesus Christ to help us change our nature.
We are taught in the Book of Mormon:
For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father. [Mosiah 3:19]
Spinner
I actually had a horse who helped me appreciate the amazing process of change. When our children were young, my wife and I looked for a gentle, well-broke children’s horse. Our neighbor had such a horse, but he would sell us kind and gentle Bob only if we also bought his other horse, Stubby. The names alone describe the horses. Eventually we decided to purchase both horses in order to acquire Bob.
Sure enough, Bob was wonderful, and Stubby ended up being, as expected, a stubborn, strong-willed, obnoxious animal who consistently acted up and caused trouble with the other horses. Because of our limited number of horses, I usuall</span>

One summer many, many years ago, my mother decided it would be a great project for her children to refinish the dining room chairs. The chairs were painted a dark cherry color, and my mother had discovered that underneath that paint was good, hard maple wood.
I will never forget that experience. We began by applying a nasty solvent called toluene to all the painted surfaces, and then we scraped the paint off. Once the paint was removed, we had to sand the wood with several grades of sandpaper in order to remove the very last bits of paint and to prepare the wood for a new finish. When the sanding was finally done, we applied a finish to highlight the grain and enhance the wood’s natural color. In the final step we sealed the new hardwood finish with two coats of varnish. Those chairs were transformed!
I think about that experience every time I read Alma’s penetrating question to the members of the Church in Zarahemla:
Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.1
The words “are ye stripped of pride?” evoke in me images and smells from that summer. I think of toluene and scraping and stripping and sanding to get down to bare wood. When I think of the finishing process with a vibrant color and the protecting sealing varnish, I think of the description of the Savior as “the author and finisher of our faith”2 and the words of King Benjamin to his people:
Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his.3
My message today is about being stripped of pride. I want to talk with you about overcoming pride and becoming humble followers of Christ.
Pride—The Universal Sin, the Great Vice
Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson delivered a powerful sermon on pride. It is a talk all of us should read carefully and often. Speaking in general conference, President Benson said:
The central feature of pride is enmity—enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. Enmity means “hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition.” It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us. . . .
Pride affects all of us at various times and in various degrees. . . .
Pride is the universal sin, the great vice.4
Pride in all of its manifestations has played a central role in the struggle between good and evil, a struggle going back to the War</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am both grateful and humbled to be with you today. It is often the case in Church assignments that the one who is called to serve is not the most qualified; rather, those with a need for growth or insight are given the task. I have been greatly blessed by my preparations—blessed in more ways than I could begin to share in the time allotted. I pray that through the influence of the Holy Ghost you may benefit from what I have learned and that we may all be edified together this morning.
In my preparations I have felt guided to focus my comments on the theme “Lessons of Pride and Glory from the Doctrine and Covenants.” I should clarify at first that this is not intended to be a pep talk about worldly notions of fame and glory or honor and glory. Pride is a sin—the universal sin, as described by President Ezra Taft Benson in his seminal conference address of April 1989 (see “Beware of Pride,” Ensign, May 1989, 4–7). I have personally come to believe that pride is Satan’s great counterfeit for glory. As with so many other principles and potential heavenly rewards, Lucifer seeks to deceive us by offering a lesser compromise that may for a moment bring gratification but ultimately leads to remorse and sorrow.
And as for defining glory, we may ask ourselves: What is glory? What is the eternal nature of glory? Why is it mentioned so frequently in the scriptures? Why is it correct and even essential that we aspire to glory, while the very notion of righteous pride is a grievous sin? What are the potential dangers of confusing the two?
Within the Church we refer often to the concept of glory. We speak of the three degrees of glory as described in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In President Joseph F. Smith’s vision of the spirit world, he noted among those assembled to greet the resurrected Lord the presence of “our glorious Mother Eve” (D&amp;C 138:3839). Many of the hymns that Christians sing invoke glory to God, suggesting a form of praise. In many scriptural passages we are admonished to live with an eye single to the glory of God. Earlier versions of the BYU logo even prominently displayed the scriptural phrase “the glory of God is intelligence” (D&amp;C 93:36), as if to imply a mantra for our pursuit of truth at the university.
I recall from when I was a teenager and young adult that President Spencer W. Kimball often began his remarks in Church meetings by stating what a glorious occasion it was to be gathered together. I confess that as a teenager I failed to grasp what was so glorious about all those Church meetings, but President Kimball’s enthusiasm and insistence that the occasions were glorious always left an impression in my mind.
My point is that we tend to think of glory only in abstract terms without giving careful thought to its full significance. In my personal study of the Doctrine and Covenants, the principles and narratives associated with glory have a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Why don’t you have crosses on your buildings of worship? Why aren’t your chapels built in the shape of a cross? Why don’t you encourage your people to wear and display crosses? What is the Church’s policy toward crosses?
From Matthew 16:24–25:
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
We in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in response to these questions, try to teach our people to carry their crosses rather than display or wear them. Over the centuries the cross has been recognized as a symbol of Christianity in the minds of millions. The Savior himself has given us the bread and water as emblems of his sacrifice and death.
My message to you this day is take up your cross. Take yourself the way you are and lift yourself in the direction of the better. Regardless of where you have been, what you have done, or what you haven’t done, trust God, believe on him, relate to him, worship him as you carry your cross with dignity and determination.
We save our lives by losing them for his sake. As you find yourself, you will find God. This is true. I declare that to you. It is his promise. Take up the real cross of Jesus Christ.
What kind of cross do you bear? What is its shape, weight, size, or dimension? We all have them. Some are very visible, while others are not always evident. Sometimes the heaviest personal cross could be to carry no cross at all. Some crosses we bear are these (maybe you will relate to one or more): the cross of loneliness; the cross of physical limitations—the loss of a leg, an arm, hearing, seeing, mobility—obvious crosses (we see people with these crosses and admire their strength in carrying them with dignity); the cross of poor health; the cross of transgression; the cross of success; the cross of temptation; the cross of beauty, fame, or wealth; the cross of financial burdens; the cross of criticism; the cross of peer rejection.
What if we are challenged with more than one cross? A beautiful young lady once said to me, “Elder Ashton, it just isn’t time for me to have another cross. I’m not quite used to the one I’m carrying now. How can I handle both?” Truly, suffering is part of our mortal existence, and suffering is not all bad.
Hidden Crosses
Today I’d like to talk in more detail about certain crosses in life that are real, but that are not always recognized or visible. Number one is the cross of the violated trust—on the part of a parent, a family member, a teacher, a bishop, a stake presidency member, a boyfriend, a classmate, a returned missionary, a girlfriend, and so on. Some of us let an act of mistrust on the part of someone close to us shatter our todays and tomorrows. A friend of mine </span>
