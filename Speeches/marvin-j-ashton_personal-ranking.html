  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="In the last two months, Tuesdays have become special days in the lives of most BYU students and friends. It is the day when the TV and radio stations and newspapers announce BYU’s ranking. Today, before leaving to come here, I asked my secretary, “What is BYU’s rating this week?” I didn’t say anything about football. I was told, “They are No. 4 in the nation.” Being ranked in the top three or four of the nation in football is not only a new high for BYU but a worthy achievement. I wholeheartedly commend Coach LaVell Edwards, his associates, and team members on their rating and winning their ninth straight WAC championship last Saturday.

It is my understanding that college football teams are basically ranked according to the number of wins and losses, who their opponents were, and by points scored or allowed. I suppose there are some weeks when some frustrated coaches think that those who determine the rankings take into consideration the color of the uniforms as part of the formula. However, I am not here today to quarrel with those who put out the rankings. I am here to talk about the words “remember” and “rank.”

Perhaps at this time of the season the best pep talk BYU coaches could give their football players would be in the form of a sign in the locker room saying “Remember.”&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;what you have been taught. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;it takes total individual commitment to the team effort to make a team work. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;self-pride and self-discipline.&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;no team is better than the performers who comprise it. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;no player is worth much who thinks he is more important than the team. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;you won’t maintain a high ranking if you don’t remember. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;words of praise and high ratings are damaging if they dull your memory. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;I am to be a class person on a class team.

“Remember” is defined as “To retain in the mind and keep carefully in memory.” For our purposes today, “rank” is defined as the degree of worth or excellence compared with others in the same category.

I believe the best-educated student or faculty member is the person who learns much, shares much, and remembers to implement the worthy in to his life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teachings to Remember&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
During the recent October general conference, all of us were encouraged to read and reread the Book of Mormon. Perhaps additional worthy counsel could be, as you read, train yourself to remember the words and feelings experienced.

In reading the book of Helaman recently, I was greatly impressed with Helaman’s emphasis in talking to his sons Nephi and Lehi about the importance of &lt;i&gt;remembering. &lt;/i&gt;The people of his time had success when they remembered his teachings. They failed when they forgot.

&lt;i&gt;Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 5:6]

Helaman gave his sons the names of Nephi and Lehi so they would remember their first parents who came out of Jerusalem. Remember and honor their great names, he pleaded. Remember them because they were good, he emphasized. Helaman’s sons gained strength and high rating as they remembered.

Teachers do students a great favor when they not only encourage them to study, but to retain and remember. Only when we remember and apply the worthy are we truly educated. An important part of true education is remembering people whose conduct helps us to do better. They are a light on dark days. They give us direction when life’s paths become cluttered.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friends to Remember&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
With this in mind, let me share five friends who rank very high with me. I will be most pleased if you will remember them and what they teach us. Three of them are on this campus. One is affiliated with another college campus forty miles or so to the north. Three will not be identified for privacy reasons. The fourth’s conduct has been a constant example of stability even before the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in this last dispensation. Obviously they are not ranked in any order.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act Instead of React&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Mary Jones, not her real name, is a relatively unknown, unranked student-body member of BYU. She is now a returned missionary. I first met her in the mission field after she had served just three months. She was a convert of less than a year. After the usual “I’m pleased to meet you,” I said, “How are things going?”

She said, “Pretty well.” Now, when missionaries tell me things are going pretty well, I know they are not going very well.

I said, “Is there something I can help you with?” She answered, “Oh no, everything is going pretty well.”

I said, “Tell me what is keeping it from going very well.”

She said, with her chin quivering, and responding from my insistence, “Well, I’ve been in the mission field three months. I’ve been a member of the Church for one year. During the three months I have been in the mission field I have not had one letter from anyone. When I joined the Church my parents disowned me. They want nothing to do with me. Elder Ashton, what can I do?”

The only thing I could think to suggest to her at that time was, “Even though your parents have disowned you and won’t write to you, do me a favor and write them every week. Write without fail; write without response; write without feelings.”

She is home from her mission attending school here and doing very well. Just the other day she greeted me and said, “Elder Ashton, I want you to know that my Mom and Dad are writing to me.”

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves—to choose . . . the way of eternal life. &lt;/i&gt;[2 Nephi 10:23]

This Mary Jones will continue to improve her personal rating as she remembers to act and not react.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lord Loves Men and Women of Integrity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Second is Hyrum Smith, the older brother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, faithful all his days. I like to study and read about Hyrum Smith because he rated very high with his Heavenly Father. We have an opportunity to be ranked high in the kingdom of God and on earth if we will do the same. Simply stated in Doctrine and Covenants 124:

&lt;i&gt;And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 124:15]

The Lord loves men and women of integrity. The Lord is pleased with those who love that which is right.

In football terms, Joseph Smith was a captain and quarterback. Hyrum was strong on defense.

It is significant that at the time of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, Hyrum, this great defender, this tremendous friend of the Savior, was shot first and fell, calmly saying: “I am a dead man!”

Let us remember why Hyrum ranks high. He remembered to love that which is right. He loved the right, and his brother more than life itself.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go Forward Humbly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Third is Mary Smith, not her real name. She is also a relatively unknown, unranked student-body member of BYU. She is on campus today a little older than most of you. Her education was delayed while she and her widowed mother financed a brother and son through the mission field and this institution.

Maybe her delay will limit her chances for the pleasures of courtship and marriage. She’s the kind of a gal I like to remember because she is willing to put others first and take her chances as she walks uprightly before her Heavenly Father with priorities that are firm and with goals that are lofty. Humbly she goes forward—not passively, but humbly. I would like to include here a statement from Alma 38:14.

&lt;i&gt;Do not say: &lt;/i&gt;O &lt;i&gt;God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: &lt;/i&gt;O &lt;i&gt;Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy—yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.&lt;/i&gt;

I would like to say in passing that Mary is one of the most selfless people I can remember.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember to Take Courage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Let’s identify number four as Harry, another person I will always remember and want to. Last week I went to the hospital to visit my friend Harry. He is slowly recovering from heart surgery that involved five bypasses. Despite great discomfort and distress physically, his attitude is excellent. During our visit he reached through sheets and tubes, took my hand and said, “Marv, say a prayer for me, will you please?” While I prayed he strongly gripped my hand. His grip was more than strong. It was powerful. Why?

In normal life Harry walks with his hands and arms. He’d been confined to a wheelchair for dozens of years. His mobility is determined by his hands and his friends. Harry and his wife, Margaret, will always be remembered by me as two of my best friends. Every time I talk to them I get a new lift from life. I remember him when I need courage. I remember him when I’m inclined to be discouraged.

I wasn’t going to identify Harry, but I think I will. He’s the head tennis coach at the University of Utah. His teams have won enough WAC tennis championships to make other coaches think about coaching from a wheelchair.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Build Your Foundation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
President Jeffrey R. Holland ranks very high on my rating list because:

1. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;to promote excellence in every academic department of BYU, within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

2. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;to enforce lofty standards of conduct for all on the campus so they may develop self-discipline, self-respect, and self-reliance. (Some of you may resist and resent, but I promise you as you mature you’ll remember it was for your best good.)

3. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;to listen and counsel without prejudice even when he doesn’t have time.

4. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;to administer with love and purpose when some would provoke him to anger.

5. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;when disappointments and discouragements surface to choose hope over despair.

6. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;the importance of smiling particularly on days when it would be easier to cry.

7. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;to love and court his wife and sweetheart, Pat, with sincere affection and respect on a steady basis.

8. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;the importance of taking time to be a good father. Family members Matt, Mary, and Duffy are not just children on the squad. They are the heart of the team! And President Holland and Pat remember to take the time to tell them so.

9. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;that when he is my doubles partner in tennis he has to do most of the work.

10. He &lt;i&gt;remembers &lt;/i&gt;to share his strong personal testimony in words similar to those spoken by Helaman:

&lt;i&gt;And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation. &lt;/i&gt;[Helaman 5:12]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Nameless Friend&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Let me share with you one more friend. We don’t even know his name. Nevertheless I would have us all remember him.

&lt;i&gt;And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion in him,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. &lt;/i&gt;[Luke 10:25–37]

Oh, how powerful in the processes of learning are good lives! The Good Samaritan—we don’t even know his name, but what a lesson, what an example.

I would humbly ask all within the sound of my voice to do me a special favor. Put a sign on your wall, on your desk, or fasten one to your mirror. Just let it have one word. The word is “Remember.” I promise you without any hesitation it can help in your ranking with yourself and God.

&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;BYU football players who get knocked down, but won’t stay there.

&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;the Savior. He is Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, our Redeemer, our advocate with the Father.

&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;he said, among other great truths, “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more” (John 8:11).

&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;the worth of souls is great in the sight of the Lord. “For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more” (Jeremiah 31:34). I hope you believe that. That is the kind of a Savior I believe in. If we repent, if we remember him, the things that we have done will not be remembered by him.

&lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;God lives. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;God loves you. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;to pray to him frequently. &lt;i&gt;Remember &lt;/i&gt;that as his children you are special.

What is the reward for those who rank high with the Lord?

&lt;i&gt;Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am. &lt;/i&gt;[D&amp;amp;C 93:1]

What is BYU’s ranking? What is your personal ranking? I thank God we have the right and responsibility to determine that ourselves.

&lt;i&gt;Remember, &lt;/i&gt;O &lt;i&gt;remember, &lt;/i&gt;the Church of Jesus Christ is true. Remember with God’s help we can know and share good cheer and happiness now and in all the days ahead. Today is a new beginning. Today is a new opportunity. I bear my testimony and share my witness that one of the greatest values and strengths in my life is not only to read and know the Savior, but to remember what he taught and remember who he is. I leave you this my testimony and my blessings in the worthy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>In the last two months, Tuesdays have become special days in the lives of most BYU students and friends. It is the day when the TV and radio stations and newspapers announce BYU’s ranking. Today, before leaving to come here, I asked my secretary, “What is BYU’s rating this week?” I didn’t say anything about football. I was told, “They are No. 4 in the nation.” Being ranked in the top three or four of the nation in football is not only a new high for BYU but a worthy achievement. I wholeheartedly commend Coach LaVell Edwards, his associates, and team members on their rating and winning their ninth straight WAC championship last Saturday.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that college football teams are basically ranked according to the number of wins and losses, who their opponents were, and by points scored or allowed. I suppose there are some weeks when some frustrated coaches think that those who determine the rankings take into consideration the color of the uniforms as part of the formula. However, I am not here today to quarrel with those who put out the rankings. I am here to talk about the words “remember” and “rank.”</p>
<p>Perhaps at this time of the season the best pep talk BYU coaches could give their football players would be in the form of a sign in the locker room saying “Remember.”<i>Remember </i>what you have been taught. <i>Remember </i>it takes total individual commitment to the team effort to make a team work. <i>Remember </i>self-pride and self-discipline.<i>Remember </i>no team is better than the performers who comprise it. <i>Remember </i>no player is worth much who thinks he is more important than the team. <i>Remember </i>you won’t maintain a high ranking if you don’t remember. <i>Remember </i>words of praise and high ratings are damaging if they dull your memory. <i>Remember </i>I am to be a class person on a class team.</p>
<p>“Remember” is defined as “To retain in the mind and keep carefully in memory.” For our purposes today, “rank” is defined as the degree of worth or excellence compared with others in the same category.</p>
<p>I believe the best-educated student or faculty member is the person who learns much, shares much, and remembers to implement the worthy in to his life.</p>
<h2><b>Teachings to Remember</b></h2>
<p>During the recent October general conference, all of us were encouraged to read and reread the Book of Mormon. Perhaps additional worthy counsel could be, as you read, train yourself to remember the words and feelings experienced.</p>
<p>In reading the book of Helaman recently, I was greatly impressed with Helaman’s emphasis in talking to his sons Nephi and Lehi about the importance of <i>remembering. </i>The people of his time had success when they remembered his teachings. They failed when they forgot.</p>
<p><i>Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good. </i>[Helaman 5:6]</p>
<p>Helaman gave his sons the names of Nephi and Lehi so they would remember their first parents who came out of Jerusalem. Remember and honor their great names, he pleaded. Remember them because they were good, he emphasized. Helaman’s sons gained strength and high rating as they remembered.</p>
<p>Teachers do students a great favor when they not only encourage them to study, but to retain and remember. Only when we remember and apply the worthy are we truly educated. An important part of true education is remembering people whose conduct helps us to do better. They are a light on dark days. They give us direction when life’s paths become cluttered.</p>
<h2><b>Friends to Remember</b></h2>
<p>With this in mind, let me share five friends who rank very high with me. I will be most pleased if you will remember them and what they teach us. Three of them are on this campus. One is affiliated with another college campus forty miles or so to the north. Three will not be identified for privacy reasons. The fourth’s conduct has been a constant example of stability even before the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in this last dispensation. Obviously they are not ranked in any order.</p>
<h2><b>Act Instead of React</b></h2>
<p>Mary Jones, not her real name, is a relatively unknown, unranked student-body member of BYU. She is now a returned missionary. I first met her in the mission field after she had served just three months. She was a convert of less than a year. After the usual “I’m pleased to meet you,” I said, “How are things going?”</p>
<p>She said, “Pretty well.” Now, when missionaries tell me things are going pretty well, I know they are not going very well.</p>
<p>I said, “Is there something I can help you with?” She answered, “Oh no, everything is going pretty well.”</p>
<p>I said, “Tell me what is keeping it from going very well.”</p>
<p>She said, with her chin quivering, and responding from my insistence, “Well, I’ve been in the mission field three months. I’ve been a member of the Church for one year. During the three months I have been in the mission field I have not had one letter from anyone. When I joined the Church my parents disowned me. They want nothing to do with me. Elder Ashton, what can I do?”</p>
<p>The only thing I could think to suggest to her at that time was, “Even though your parents have disowned you and won’t write to you, do me a favor and write them every week. Write without fail; write without response; write without feelings.”</p>
<p>She is home from her mission attending school here and doing very well. Just the other day she greeted me and said, “Elder Ashton, I want you to know that my Mom and Dad are writing to me.”</p>
<p><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves—to choose . . . the way of eternal life. </i>[2 Nephi 10:23]</p>
<p>This Mary Jones will continue to improve her personal rating as she remembers to act and not react.</p>
<h2><b>The Lord Loves Men and Women of Integrity</b></h2>
<p>Second is Hyrum Smith, the older brother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, faithful all his days. I like to study and read about Hyrum Smith because he rated very high with his Heavenly Father. We have an opportunity to be ranked high in the kingdom of God and on earth if we will do the same. Simply stated in Doctrine and Covenants 124:</p>
<p><i>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord. </i>[D&amp;C 124:15]</p>
<p>The Lord loves men and women of integrity. The Lord is pleased with those who love that which is right.</p>
<p>In football terms, Joseph Smith was a captain and quarterback. Hyrum was strong on defense.</p>
<p>It is significant that at the time of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, Hyrum, this great defender, this tremendous friend of the Savior, was shot first and fell, calmly saying: “I am a dead man!”</p>
<p>Let us remember why Hyrum ranks high. He remembered to love that which is right. He loved the right, and his brother more than life itself.</p>
<h2><b>Go Forward Humbly</b></h2>
<p>Third is Mary Smith, not her real name. She is also a relatively unknown, unranked student-body member of BYU. She is on campus today a little older than most of you. Her education was delayed while she and her widowed mother financed a brother and son through the mission field and this institution.</p>
<p>Maybe her delay will limit her chances for the pleasures of courtship and marriage. She’s the kind of a gal I like to remember because she is willing to put others first and take her chances as she walks uprightly before her Heavenly Father with priorities that are firm and with goals that are lofty. Humbly she goes forward—not passively, but humbly. I would like to include here a statement from Alma 38:14.</p>
<p><i>Do not say: </i>O <i>God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: </i>O <i>Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy—yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.</i></p>
<p>I would like to say in passing that Mary is one of the most selfless people I can remember.</p>
<h2><b>Remember to Take Courage</b></h2>
<p>Let’s identify number four as Harry, another person I will always remember and want to. Last week I went to the hospital to visit my friend Harry. He is slowly recovering from heart surgery that involved five bypasses. Despite great discomfort and distress physically, his attitude is excellent. During our visit he reached through sheets and tubes, took my hand and said, “Marv, say a prayer for me, will you please?” While I prayed he strongly gripped my hand. His grip was more than strong. It was powerful. Why?</p>
<p>In normal life Harry walks with his hands and arms. He’d been confined to a wheelchair for dozens of years. His mobility is determined by his hands and his friends. Harry and his wife, Margaret, will always be remembered by me as two of my best friends. Every time I talk to them I get a new lift from life. I remember him when I need courage. I remember him when I’m inclined to be discouraged.</p>
<p>I wasn’t going to identify Harry, but I think I will. He’s the head tennis coach at the University of Utah. His teams have won enough WAC tennis championships to make other coaches think about coaching from a wheelchair.</p>
<h2><b>Build Your Foundation</b></h2>
<p>President Jeffrey R. Holland ranks very high on my rating list because:</p>
<p>1. He <i>remembers </i>to promote excellence in every academic department of BYU, within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2. He <i>remembers </i>to enforce lofty standards of conduct for all on the campus so they may develop self-discipline, self-respect, and self-reliance. (Some of you may resist and resent, but I promise you as you mature you’ll remember it was for your best good.)</p>
<p>3. He <i>remembers </i>to listen and counsel without prejudice even when he doesn’t have time.</p>
<p>4. He <i>remembers </i>to administer with love and purpose when some would provoke him to anger.</p>
<p>5. He <i>remembers </i>when disappointments and discouragements surface to choose hope over despair.</p>
<p>6. He <i>remembers </i>the importance of smiling particularly on days when it would be easier to cry.</p>
<p>7. He <i>remembers </i>to love and court his wife and sweetheart, Pat, with sincere affection and respect on a steady basis.</p>
<p>8. He <i>remembers </i>the importance of taking time to be a good father. Family members Matt, Mary, and Duffy are not just children on the squad. They are the heart of the team! And President Holland and Pat remember to take the time to tell them so.</p>
<p>9. He <i>remembers </i>that when he is my doubles partner in tennis he has to do most of the work.</p>
<p>10. He <i>remembers </i>to share his strong personal testimony in words similar to those spoken by Helaman:</p>
<p><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation. </i>[Helaman 5:12]</p>
<h2><b>A Nameless Friend</b></h2>
<p>Let me share with you one more friend. We don’t even know his name. Nevertheless I would have us all remember him.</p>
<p><i>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i></p>
<p><i>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</i></p>
<p><i>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.</i></p>
<p><i>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</i></p>
<p><i>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</i></p>
<p><i>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</i></p>
<p><i>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</i></p>
<p><i>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</i></p>
<p><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion in him,</i></p>
<p><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</i></p>
<p><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i></p>
<p><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</i></p>
<p><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.</i></p>
<p><i>Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. </i>[Luke 10:25–37]</p>
<p>Oh, how powerful in the processes of learning are good lives! The Good Samaritan—we don’t even know his name, but what a lesson, what an example.</p>
<p>I would humbly ask all within the sound of my voice to do me a special favor. Put a sign on your wall, on your desk, or fasten one to your mirror. Just let it have one word. The word is “Remember.” I promise you without any hesitation it can help in your ranking with yourself and God.</p>
<p><i>Remember </i>BYU football players who get knocked down, but won’t stay there.</p>
<p><i>Remember </i>the Savior. He is Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, our Redeemer, our advocate with the Father.</p>
<p><i>Remember </i>he said, among other great truths, “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more” (John 8:11).</p>
<p><i>Remember </i>the worth of souls is great in the sight of the Lord. “For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more” (Jeremiah 31:34). I hope you believe that. That is the kind of a Savior I believe in. If we repent, if we remember him, the things that we have done will not be remembered by him.</p>
<p><i>Remember </i>God lives. <i>Remember </i>God loves you. <i>Remember </i>to pray to him frequently. <i>Remember </i>that as his children you are special.</p>
<p>What is the reward for those who rank high with the Lord?</p>
<p><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am. </i>[D&amp;C 93:1]</p>
<p>What is BYU’s ranking? What is your personal ranking? I thank God we have the right and responsibility to determine that ourselves.</p>
<p><i>Remember, </i>O <i>remember, </i>the Church of Jesus Christ is true. Remember with God’s help we can know and share good cheer and happiness now and in all the days ahead. Today is a new beginning. Today is a new opportunity. I bear my testimony and share my witness that one of the greatest values and strengths in my life is not only to read and know the Savior, but to remember what he taught and remember who he is. I leave you this my testimony and my blessings in the worthy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your ­family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on—and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy—one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of God’s plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch—choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.2
With this gift of time, you won’t always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what ­happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Deter­mine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We can’t refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, ­faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of “outstanding life and contribution to society and the world.”
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, “With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor.”
Then my daughter exclaimed, “What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!”
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xi’an Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, “Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well.” Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer—now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater—in Chinese, “the mother school.”
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, “As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them.”
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto “Go forth to serve” has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, “go forth to serve” could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of one’s undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you—graduates, parents, and other supporters—thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: “Wow! So how do those fit together?” In some ways they don’t. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests—like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life” (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn’t end, the quest doesn’t end, and our relationships don’t end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didn’t know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: “Believe in yourself as I believe in you.” It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together (“Believe in Yourself,” The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
