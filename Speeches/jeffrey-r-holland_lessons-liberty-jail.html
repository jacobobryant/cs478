  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="My beloved young friends, it is a thrill for Sister Holland and for me to be with you tonight for this worldwide satellite broadcast. Its always a thrill to be in the Marriott Center. I wish it were possible for us to be in each of your individual locations, seeing you personally and being able to shake your hands. We havent figured out a way to do that yet, but we send our love and greeting to all of you wherever you are in the world. In spite of the vastness of our global audience, we hope all of you are individually able to feel the love we have for you tonight and that each of you can gain something from our message that is applicable in your personal lives.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Prophet in Liberty Jail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the great blessings of our assignments as General Authorities is the chance to visit members of the Church in various locations around the world and to glean from the history that our members have experienced across the globe. In that spirit I wish to share with you tonight some feelings that came to me during a Church assignment I had last spring when I was assigned to visit the Platte City stake in western Missouri, here in the United States.

The Platte City Missouri Stake lies adjacent to the Liberty Missouri Stake, now a very famous location in Church history encompassing several important Church history sites, including the ironically named Liberty Jail. From your study of Church history, you will all know something of the experience the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brethren had while imprisoned in that facility during the winter of 183839. This was a terribly difficult time in our history for the Church generally and certainly for the Prophet Joseph himself, who bore the brunt of the persecution in that period. Indeed, I daresay that until his martyrdom five and a half years later, there was no more burdensome time in Josephs life than this cruel, illegal, and unjustified incarceration in Liberty Jail.

Time does not permit a detailed discussion of the experiences that led up to this moment in Church history, but suffice it to say that problems of various kinds had been building ever since the Prophet Joseph had received a revelation in July of 1831 designating Missouri as the place "consecrated for the gathering of the saints" and the building up of "the city of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 57:1, 2). By October of 1838, all-out war seemed inevitable between Mormon and non-Mormon forces confronting each other over these issues. After being driven from several of the counties in the western part of that state and under the presumption they had been invited to discuss ways of defusing the volatile situation that had developed, five leaders of the Church, including the Prophet Joseph, marching under a flag of truce, approached the camp of the Missouri militia near the small settlement of Far West, located in Caldwell County.

As it turned out, the flag of truce was meaningless, and the Church leaders were immediately put in chains and placed under heavy guard. The morning after this arrest, two more Latter-day Saint leaders, including the Prophets brother Hyrum, were taken prisoner, making a total of seven in captivity.

Injustice swiftly moved forward toward potential tragedy when a military "court" convened by officers of that militia ordered that Joseph Smith and the six other prisoners all be taken to the public square at Far West and summarily shot. To his eternal credit, Brigadier General Alexander Doniphan, an officer in the Missouri forces, boldly and courageously refused to carry out the inhumane, unjustifiable order. In a daring stand that could have brought him his own court-martial, he cried out against the commanding officer:

&lt;i&gt;It is cold-blooded murder. I will not obey your order. . . . And if you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

In showing such courage and integrity, Doniphan not only saved the lives of these seven men but endeared himself forever to Latter-day Saints in every generation.

Their execution averted, these seven Church leaders were marched on foot from Far West to Independence, then from Independence to Richmond. Parley P. Pratt was remanded to nearby Daviess County for trial there, and the other six prisoners, including Joseph and Hyrum, were sent to Liberty, the county seat of neighboring Clay County, to await trial there the next spring. They arrived in Liberty on December 1, 1838, just as winter was coming on.

The jail, one of the few and certainly one of the more forbidding of such structures in that region, was considered escape proof, and it probably was. It had two stories. The top or main floor was accessible to the outside world only by a single small, heavy door. In the middle of that floor was a trapdoor through which prisoners were then lowered into the lower floor or dungeon. The outside walls of the prison were of rough-hewn limestone two feet thick, with inside walls of 12-inch oak logs. These two walls were separated by a 12-inch space filled with loose rock. Combined, these walls made a formidable, virtually impenetrable barrier four feet thick.

In the dungeon the floor-to-ceiling height was barely six feet, and inasmuch as some of the men, including the Prophet Joseph, were over six feet tall, this meant that when standing they were constantly in a stooped position, and when lying it was mostly upon the rough, bare stones of the prison floor covered here and there by a bit of loose, dirty straw or an occasional dirty straw mat.

The food given to the prisoners was coarse and sometimes contaminated, so filthy that one of them said they "could not eat it until [they] were driven to it by hunger."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; On as many as four occasions they had poison administered to them in their food, making them so violently ill that for days they alternated between vomiting and a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the Prophet Josephs letters, he spoke of the jail being a

&lt;i&gt;hell, surrounded with demons . . . where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

"We have . . . not blankets sufficient to keep us warm," he said, "and when we have a fire, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; "Our souls have been bowed down"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and "my nerve trembles from long confinement."&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; "Pen, or tongue, or angels," Joseph wrote, could not adequately describe "the malice of hell" that he suffered there.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; And all of this occurred during what, by some accounts, was considered then the coldest winter on record in the state of Missouri.

It is not my purpose to make this a speech about the sorrow and difficulty these men confronted in Liberty Jail, so let me put a few photos on the screen and conclude this little introductory portion of my message. I promise I have something else in mind to say.

[A photo of Liberty Jail was shown.] Here is a photo of the jail pretty much as it stood at the time Joseph and his brethren were incarcerated there.

[Another photo of Liberty Jail was shown.] Here is a photo taken some years later when officers and historians from the Church visited the location. Im not sure if that fellow on top is trying to get out or get in.

[A photo of a model of Liberty Jail interior reconstruction was shown.] Here is a cross section of the Churchs reconstruction of the prison, which can now be seen at our visitors center there. Note the two-story arrangement with a rope and bucket, the only link between the dungeon and the upper floor.

[A picture of the painting &lt;i&gt;Joseph in Liberty Jail&lt;/i&gt; by Liz Lemon Swindle was shown.] Here is a painting by Liz Lemon Swindle showing Joseph in prayer. Note the forlorn, longing look on Josephs face.

[A picture of the painting &lt;i&gt;Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail&lt;/i&gt; by Greg Olsen was shown.] And heres a portrayal by Greg Olsen showing how Joseph may have written some of the revelations that came during this imprisonment.

[A photo of the Toronto Ontario Canada Temple was shown.] And this is my final photo, which leads me to the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; message I have come to give tonight.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Prison-Temple Experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Most of us, most of the time, speak of the facility at Liberty as a "jail" or a "prison" - and certainly it was that. But Elder Brigham H. Roberts, in recording the history of the Church, spoke of the facility as a temple, or, more accurately, a "prison-temple."&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Elder Neal A. Maxwell used the same phrasing in some of his writings.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Certainly it lacked the purity, the beauty, the comfort, and the cleanliness of our true temples, our dedicated temples. The speech and behavior of the guards and criminals who came there was anything but templelike. In fact, the restricting brutality and injustice of this experience at Liberty would make it seem the very antithesis of the liberating, merciful spirit of our temples and the ordinances that are performed in them. So in what sense could Liberty Jail be called a "temple" - or at least a kind of temple - in the development of Joseph Smith personally and in his role as a prophet? And what does such a title tell us about Gods love and teachings, including where and when that love and those teachings are made manifest?

As we think on these things, does it strike us that spiritual experience, revelatory experience, sacred experience can come to every one of us in all the many and varied stages and circumstances of our lives if we want it, if we hold on and pray on, and if we keep our faith strong through our difficulties? We love and cherish our dedicated temples and the essential, exalting ordinances that are performed there. We thank heaven and the presiding Brethren that more and more of them are being built, giving more and more of us greater access to them. They are truly the holiest, most sacred structures in the kingdom of God, to which we all ought to go as worthily and as often as possible.

But tonights message is that when you have to, you can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; situation you are in. Indeed, let me say that even a little stronger: You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord &lt;i&gt;in the most miserable experiences of your life - &lt;/i&gt;in the worst settings, while enduring the most painful injustices, when facing the most insurmountable odds and opposition you have ever faced.

Now lets talk about those propositions for a moment. Every one of us, in one way or another, great or small, dramatic or incidental, is going to spend a little time in Liberty Jail - spiritually speaking. We will face things we do not want to face for reasons that may not have been our fault. Indeed, we may face difficult circumstances for reasons that were absolutely right and proper, reasons that came &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; we were trying to keep the commandments of the Lord. We may face persecution; we may endure heartache and separation from loved ones; we may be hungry and cold and forlorn. Yes, before our lives are over we may all be given a little taste of what the prophets faced often in their lives. But the lessons of the winter of 183839 teach us that &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; experience can become a &lt;i&gt;redemptive&lt;/i&gt; experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty. These difficult lessons teach us that mans extremity is Gods opportunity, and if we will be humble and faithful, if we will be believing and not curse God for our problems, He can turn the unfair and inhumane and debilitating prisons of our lives into temples - or at least into a circumstance that can bring comfort and revelation, divine companionship and peace.

Let me push this just a little further. Ive just said that hard times &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; happen to us. President Joseph Fielding Smith, grandnephew of the Prophet Joseph and grandson of the incarcerated Hyrum, said something even stronger than that when he dedicated the Liberty Jail Visitors Center in 1963. Alluding to the kind of history weve reviewed tonight and looking on the scene where his grandfather and granduncle were so unjustly held, he said perhaps such things &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to happen - not only can they happen, perhaps they have to. Said he:

&lt;i&gt;As I have read the history of those days, the days that went before and days that came after, I have reached the conclusion that the hardships, the persecution, the almost universal opposition&lt;/i&gt; [toward the Church at that time] &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; necessary. &lt;i&gt;At any rate they became school teachers to our people. They helped to make&lt;/i&gt; [them] &lt;i&gt;strong.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lessons from Liberty Jail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Well, without trying to determine which of these kinds of experiences in our life are "mandatory" and which are "optional" but still good for us, may I suggest just a very few of the lessons learned at Liberty - those experiences that were "school teachers" to Joseph and can be to us, experiences that contribute so much to our education in mortality and our exaltation in eternity.

In selecting these lessons I note yet another kind of blessing that came out of this adversity. To make the points that I am now going to try to make in my message to you, I have drawn directly upon the revelatory words that came from the lips of Joseph Smith during this heartbreaking time, words that we now have canonized as sacred scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants. I guess were not supposed to have favorite scriptures, and I have enough of them that you wont be able to pin me down to one or two, but certainly any list of my favorite scriptures would have to include those written from the darkness of Liberty Jail.

So what we instantly learn is that God was not only teaching Joseph Smith in that prison circumstance but He was teaching &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of us, for generations yet to come. What a scriptural gift! And what a high price was paid for it! But how empty would our lives as Latter-day Saints be if we did not have sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you have not read them recently, I want you to read them tonight, or tomorrow at the latest - no later. That is your homework assignment, and I will be checking on you! They are contained in total on a mere six pages of text, but those six pages will touch your heart with their beauty and their power. And they will remind you that God often "moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform."&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; In any case, He certainly turned adversity into blessing in giving us those sacred writings and reflections, so pure, noble, and Christian in both tone and content, yet produced in such an impure, ignoble, and unchristian setting.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Everyone Faces Trying Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Now then, three lessons from Liberty Jail: May I suggest that the first of these is inherent in what Ive already said - that everyone, including (and perhaps especially) the righteous, will be called upon to face trying times. When that happens we can sometimes fear God has abandoned us, and we might be left, at least for a time, to wonder when our troubles will ever end. As individuals, as families, as communities, and as nations, probably everyone has had or will have an occasion to feel as Joseph Smith felt when he asked why such sorrow had to come and how long its darkness and damage would remain. We identify with him when he cries from the depth and discouragement of his confinement:

&lt;i&gt;O God, where art thou? . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;How long shall thy hand be stayed . . . ?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yea, O Lord, how long shall&lt;/i&gt; [thy people] &lt;i&gt;suffer . . . before . . . thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 121:13]

That is a painful, personal cry - a cry from the heart, a spiritual loneliness we may all have occasion to feel at some time in our lives.

Perhaps you have had such moments already in your young lives. If so, I hope you have not had too many. But whenever these moments of our extremity come, we must not succumb to the fear that God has abandoned us or that He does not hear our prayers. He &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; hear us. He &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; see us. He &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; love us. When we are in dire circumstances and want to cry "Where art Thou?" it is imperative that we remember He is right there with us - where He has always been! We must continue to believe, continue to have faith, continue to pray and plead with heaven, even if we feel for a time our prayers are not heard and that God has somehow gone away. He &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; there. Our prayers &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; heard. And when we weep He and the angels of heaven weep with us.

When lonely, cold, hard times come, we have to endure, we have to continue, we have to persist. That was the Saviors message in the parable of the importuning widow (see Luke 18:18; see also Luke 11:510). Keep knocking on that door. Keep pleading. In the meantime, know that God hears your cries and knows your distress. He is your Father, and you are His child.

When what has to be has been and when what lessons to be learned have been learned, it will be for us as it was for the Prophet Joseph. Just at the time he felt most alone and distant from heavens ear was the very time he received the wonderful ministration of the Spirit and wonderful, glorious answers that came from his Father in Heaven. Into this dismal dungeon and this depressing time, the voice of God came, saying:

&lt;i&gt;My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 121:78]

Even though seemingly unjust circumstances may be heaped upon us and even though unkind and unmerited things may be done to us - perhaps by those we consider enemies but also, in some cases, by those whom we thought were friends - nevertheless, through it all, &lt;i&gt;God is with us.&lt;/i&gt; That is why we had our marvelous choir sing tonight Sarah Adams traditional, old Christian hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee" with that seldom-sung fourth verse, which they sang so beautifully:

&lt;i&gt;Out of my stony griefs&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Bethel Ill raise;&lt;/i&gt;

So by my woes &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nearer, my God, to thee.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

We are not alone in our little prisons here. When suffering, we may in fact be nearer to God than weve ever been in our entire lives. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; knowledge can turn every such situation into a would-be temple.

Regarding our earthly journey, the Lord has promised:

&lt;i&gt;I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 84:88]

That is an everlasting declaration of Gods love and care for us, including - and perhaps especially - in times of trouble.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Even the Worthy Will Suffer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Secondly, we need to realize that just because difficult things happen - sometimes unfair and seemingly unjustified things - it does not mean that we are unrighteous or that we are unworthy of blessings or that God is disappointed in us. Of course sinfulness does bring suffering, and the only answer to that behavior is repentance. But sometimes suffering comes to the righteous, too. You will recall that from the depths of Liberty Jail when Joseph was reminded that he had indeed been "cast . . . into trouble," had passed through tribulation and been falsely accused, had been torn away from his family and cast into a pit, into the hands of murderers, nevertheless, he was to remember that &lt;i&gt;the same thing had happened to the Savior of the world,&lt;/i&gt; and because He was triumphant, so shall we be (see D&amp;amp;C 122:47). In giving us this sober reminder of what the Savior went through, the revelation from Liberty Jail records: "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:8).

No. Joseph was not greater than the Savior, and neither are we. And when we promise to follow the Savior, to walk in His footsteps and be His disciples, we are promising to go where that divine path leads us. And the path of salvation has always led one way or another through Gethsemane. So if the Savior faced such injustices and discouragements, such persecutions, unrighteousness, and suffering, we cannot expect that we are not going to face some of that if we still intend to call ourselves His true disciples and faithful followers. And it certainly underscores the fact that the righteous - in the Saviors case, the personification of righteousness - can be totally worthy before God and still suffer.

In fact, it ought to be a matter of great doctrinal consolation to us that Jesus, in the course of the Atonement, experienced all of the heartache and sorrow, all of the disappointments and injustices that the entire family of man had experienced and would experience from Adam and Eve to the end of the world in order that we would not have to face them so severely or so deeply. However heavy our load might be, it would be a lot heavier if the Savior had not gone that way before us and carried that burden with us and for us.

Very early in the Prophet Josephs ministry, the Savior taught him this doctrine. After speaking of sufferings so exquisite to feel and so hard to bear, Jesus said:

&lt;i&gt;I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they&lt;/i&gt; [and that means you and I and everyone] &lt;i&gt;might not suffer if they would repent.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 19:16]

In our moments of pain and trial, I guess we would shudder to think it could be worse, but the answer to that is clearly that it &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be worse and it &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be worse. Only through our faith and repentance and obedience to the gospel that provided the sacred Atonement is it kept from &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; worse.

Furthermore, we note that not only has the Savior suffered, in His case entirely innocently, but so have most of the prophets and other great men and women recorded in the scriptures. Name an Old Testament or Book of Mormon prophet, name a New Testament Apostle, name virtually any of the leaders in any dispensation, including our own, and you name someone who has had trouble.

My point? If you are having a bad day, youve got a lot of company - very, very good company. The best company that has ever lived.

Now, dont misunderstand. We dont have to look for sorrow. We dont have to seek to be martyrs. Trouble has a way of finding us even without our looking for it. But when it is obvious that a little time in Liberty Jail waits before you (spiritually speaking), remember these first two truths taught to Joseph in that prison-temple. First, God has &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; forgotten you, and second, the Savior has been where you have been, allowing Him to provide for your deliverance and your comfort.

As the prophet Isaiah wrote, the Lord has "graven thee upon the palms of [His] hands" (Isaiah 49:16), permanently written right there in scar tissue with Roman nails as the writing instrument. Having paid that price in the suffering that They have paid for you, the Father and the Son will never forget nor forsake you in your suffering. (See Isaiah 49:1416; see also 1 Nephi 21:1416.) They have planned, prepared, and guaranteed your victory if you desire it, so be believing and "endure it well" (D&amp;amp;C 121:8). In the end it "shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7), and you will see "everlasting dominion" flow unto you forever and ever "without compulsory means" (D&amp;amp;C 121:46).
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Remain Calm, Patient, Charitable, and Forgiving&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Thirdly, and tonight lastly, may I remind us all that in the midst of these difficult feelings when one could justifiably be angry or reactionary or vengeful, wanting to return an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, the Lord reminds us from the Liberty Jail prison-temple that

&lt;i&gt;the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only&lt;/i&gt; [or "except"] &lt;i&gt;upon the principles of righteousness.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 121:36]

Therefore, even when we face such distressing circumstances in our life and there is something in us that wants to strike out at God or man or friend or foe, we must remember that "no power or influence &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to be maintained [except] by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; . . . without hypocrisy, and without guile" (D&amp;amp;C 121:4142; emphasis added).

It has always been a wonderful testimony to me of the Prophet Josephs greatness and the greatness of all of our prophets, including and especially the Savior of the world in His magnificence, that in the midst of such distress and difficulty they could remain calm and patient, charitable, and forgiving - that they could even talk that way, let alone live that way. But they could, and they did. They remembered their covenants, they disciplined themselves, and they knew that we must live the gospel at all times, not just when it is convenient and not just when things are going well. Indeed, they knew that the real test of our faith and our Christian discipleship is when things are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going smoothly. That is when we get to see what were made of and how strong our commitment to the gospel really is.

Surely the classic example of this is that in the most painful hours of the Crucifixion the Savior could say, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). That is a hard thing to ask when were hurting. That is a hard thing to do when weve been offended or are tired or stressed out or suffering innocently. But that is when Christian behavior may matter the most. Remember, "the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled [except] upon the principles of righteousness." And do we need the powers of heaven with us at such times! As Joseph was taught in this prison-temple, even in distress and sorrow we must "let [our] bowels . . . be full of charity towards all men . . .  ; then [and only then] shall [our] confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and . . . the Holy Ghost shall be [our] constant companion" (D&amp;amp;C 121:4546).

Remaining true to our Christian principles is the only way divine influence can help us. The Spirit has a near-impossible task to get through to a heart that is filled with hate or anger or vengeance or self-pity. Those are all antithetical to the Spirit of the Lord. On the other hand, the Spirit finds instant access to a heart striving to be charitable and forgiving, long-suffering and kind - principles of true discipleship. What a testimony that gospel principles are to apply at all times and in all situations and that if we strive to remain faithful, the triumph of a Christian life can never be vanquished, no matter how grim the circumstance might be. How I love the majesty of these elegant, celestial teachings taught, ironically, in such a despicable setting and time.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do All Things Cheerfully&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As a valedictory to the lessons from Liberty Jail, I refer to the last verse of the last section of these three we have been referring to tonight. In this final canonized statement of the Liberty Jail experience, the Lord says to us through His prophet, Joseph Smith:

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, dearly beloved brethren&lt;/i&gt; [and sisters, when we are in even the most troubling of times], &lt;i&gt;let us&lt;/i&gt; cheerfully &lt;i&gt;do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 123:17; emphasis added]

What a tremendously optimistic and faithful concluding declaration to be issued from a prison-temple! When he wrote those lines, Joseph did not know when he would be released or if he would ever be released. There was every indication that his enemies were still planning to take his life. Furthermore, his wife and children were alone, frightened, often hungry, wondering how they would fend for themselves without their husband and father. The Saints, too, were without homes and without their prophet. They were leaving Missouri, heading for Illinois, but who knew what tragedies were awaiting them there? Surely, to say it again, it was the bleakest and darkest of times.

Yet in these cold, lonely hours, Joseph says let us do all we can &lt;i&gt;and do it cheerfully.&lt;/i&gt; And then we can justifiably turn to the Lord, wait upon His mercy, and see His arm revealed in our behalf.

What a magnificent attitude to maintain in good times or bad, in sorrow or in joy!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blessing and Testimony&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My beloved young friends, as part of my concluding testimony to you tonight, I wish to give you a blessing. It seems to me that as our apostolic witnesses are taken into the world, we have two opportunities and, indeed, perhaps obligations. One is to testify and bear witness, as I have been trying to do and will conclude in doing. The other is to bless - as the ancient Apostles did when the Savior invited them to do as He had done, except that it would be in all the world.

So for every one of you in attendance tonight - here in this vast auditorium or in other locations around the world - I bless every one of you, each one of you in your individual circumstances, as if my hands were on your head. I offer that to you as honestly as I offer my testimony. I bless you in the name of the Lord that God does love you, does hear your prayers, is at your side, and will never leave you.

I bless the brethren that you - that we - will be worthy of the priesthood we bear, that we will live true to the discipleship to which we have been called, in that great order, the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. I bless you that we will really be like the Master - that we will think more like He thinks, that we will talk more like He talks, and that we will do more of what He did. I bless you brethren as you strive to be faithful that you will have all the blessings of the priesthood, many of which we have quoted tonight from these very sections from the Doctrine and Covenants.

I bless the sisters within this audience and within the sound of my voice. I would have you know how much we cherish you, how much God cherishes you, and how much the flag of faith has been flown by the sisters of this Church from the beginning. In every generation, it would seem, from the beginning of time down to the present hour and beyond, so often it has been the women in our lives - our grandmothers, our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our sisters, our granddaughters - who have taken that torch of faith and that banner of beautiful living and have carried gospel principles wherever it would take them, against whatever hardship, into their own little equivalent of Liberty Jails and difficult times. Sisters, we love you and honor you and bless you. We ask that every righteous desire of your heart, tonight and forever, be answered upon your head and that you will walk away from this devotional with the understanding and the knowledge firmly in your heart as to how much God and heaven and the presiding Brethren of this Church love you and honor you.

I salute you young adults of this Church in this great CES congregation and say that the future is in your hands. Those of us of my generation have to, in the very near future, pass the baton to you. God bless you to face those times with the valor, the honesty, and the integrity we have spoken of here tonight.

In closing, I testify that the Father and the Son do live. And I testify that They are close, perhaps even closest via the Holy Spirit, when we are experiencing difficult times. I testify (and as our closing musical number, "My Kindness Shall Not Depart from Thee," will testify, quoting the prophet Isaiah) that heavens kindness will &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; depart from you, regardless of what happens (see Isaiah 54:710; see also 3 Nephi 22:710). I testify that bad days come to an end, that faith always triumphs, and that heavenly promises are always kept. I testify that God is our Father, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is the true and living gospel - found in this, the true and living Church. I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God, our prophet for this hour and this day. I love him and sustain him as I know you do. In the words of the Liberty Jail prison-temple experience, my young friends, "Hold on thy way. . . . Fear not . . . , for God shall be with you forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 122:9). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>My beloved young friends, it is a thrill for Sister Holland and for me to be with you tonight for this worldwide satellite broadcast. Its always a thrill to be in the Marriott Center. I wish it were possible for us to be in each of your individual locations, seeing you personally and being able to shake your hands. We havent figured out a way to do that yet, but we send our love and greeting to all of you wherever you are in the world. In spite of the vastness of our global audience, we hope all of you are individually able to feel the love we have for you tonight and that each of you can gain something from our message that is applicable in your personal lives.</p>
<h2><b>The Prophet in Liberty Jail</b></h2>
<p>One of the great blessings of our assignments as General Authorities is the chance to visit members of the Church in various locations around the world and to glean from the history that our members have experienced across the globe. In that spirit I wish to share with you tonight some feelings that came to me during a Church assignment I had last spring when I was assigned to visit the Platte City stake in western Missouri, here in the United States.</p>
<p>The Platte City Missouri Stake lies adjacent to the Liberty Missouri Stake, now a very famous location in Church history encompassing several important Church history sites, including the ironically named Liberty Jail. From your study of Church history, you will all know something of the experience the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brethren had while imprisoned in that facility during the winter of 183839. This was a terribly difficult time in our history for the Church generally and certainly for the Prophet Joseph himself, who bore the brunt of the persecution in that period. Indeed, I daresay that until his martyrdom five and a half years later, there was no more burdensome time in Josephs life than this cruel, illegal, and unjustified incarceration in Liberty Jail.</p>
<p>Time does not permit a detailed discussion of the experiences that led up to this moment in Church history, but suffice it to say that problems of various kinds had been building ever since the Prophet Joseph had received a revelation in July of 1831 designating Missouri as the place "consecrated for the gathering of the saints" and the building up of "the city of Zion" (D&amp;C 57:1, 2). By October of 1838, all-out war seemed inevitable between Mormon and non-Mormon forces confronting each other over these issues. After being driven from several of the counties in the western part of that state and under the presumption they had been invited to discuss ways of defusing the volatile situation that had developed, five leaders of the Church, including the Prophet Joseph, marching under a flag of truce, approached the camp of the Missouri militia near the small settlement of Far West, located in Caldwell County.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the flag of truce was meaningless, and the Church leaders were immediately put in chains and placed under heavy guard. The morning after this arrest, two more Latter-day Saint leaders, including the Prophets brother Hyrum, were taken prisoner, making a total of seven in captivity.</p>
<p>Injustice swiftly moved forward toward potential tragedy when a military "court" convened by officers of that militia ordered that Joseph Smith and the six other prisoners all be taken to the public square at Far West and summarily shot. To his eternal credit, Brigadier General Alexander Doniphan, an officer in the Missouri forces, boldly and courageously refused to carry out the inhumane, unjustifiable order. In a daring stand that could have brought him his own court-martial, he cried out against the commanding officer:</p>
<p><i>It is cold-blooded murder. I will not obey your order. . . . And if you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God.</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In showing such courage and integrity, Doniphan not only saved the lives of these seven men but endeared himself forever to Latter-day Saints in every generation.</p>
<p>Their execution averted, these seven Church leaders were marched on foot from Far West to Independence, then from Independence to Richmond. Parley P. Pratt was remanded to nearby Daviess County for trial there, and the other six prisoners, including Joseph and Hyrum, were sent to Liberty, the county seat of neighboring Clay County, to await trial there the next spring. They arrived in Liberty on December 1, 1838, just as winter was coming on.</p>
<p>The jail, one of the few and certainly one of the more forbidding of such structures in that region, was considered escape proof, and it probably was. It had two stories. The top or main floor was accessible to the outside world only by a single small, heavy door. In the middle of that floor was a trapdoor through which prisoners were then lowered into the lower floor or dungeon. The outside walls of the prison were of rough-hewn limestone two feet thick, with inside walls of 12-inch oak logs. These two walls were separated by a 12-inch space filled with loose rock. Combined, these walls made a formidable, virtually impenetrable barrier four feet thick.</p>
<p>In the dungeon the floor-to-ceiling height was barely six feet, and inasmuch as some of the men, including the Prophet Joseph, were over six feet tall, this meant that when standing they were constantly in a stooped position, and when lying it was mostly upon the rough, bare stones of the prison floor covered here and there by a bit of loose, dirty straw or an occasional dirty straw mat.</p>
<p>The food given to the prisoners was coarse and sometimes contaminated, so filthy that one of them said they "could not eat it until [they] were driven to it by hunger."<sup>2</sup> On as many as four occasions they had poison administered to them in their food, making them so violently ill that for days they alternated between vomiting and a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the Prophet Josephs letters, he spoke of the jail being a</p>
<p><i>hell, surrounded with demons . . . where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>"We have . . . not blankets sufficient to keep us warm," he said, "and when we have a fire, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke."<sup>4</sup> "Our souls have been bowed down"<sup>5</sup> and "my nerve trembles from long confinement."<sup>6</sup> "Pen, or tongue, or angels," Joseph wrote, could not adequately describe "the malice of hell" that he suffered there.<sup>7</sup> And all of this occurred during what, by some accounts, was considered then the coldest winter on record in the state of Missouri.</p>
<p>It is not my purpose to make this a speech about the sorrow and difficulty these men confronted in Liberty Jail, so let me put a few photos on the screen and conclude this little introductory portion of my message. I promise I have something else in mind to say.</p>
<p>[A photo of Liberty Jail was shown.] Here is a photo of the jail pretty much as it stood at the time Joseph and his brethren were incarcerated there.</p>
<p>[Another photo of Liberty Jail was shown.] Here is a photo taken some years later when officers and historians from the Church visited the location. Im not sure if that fellow on top is trying to get out or get in.</p>
<p>[A photo of a model of Liberty Jail interior reconstruction was shown.] Here is a cross section of the Churchs reconstruction of the prison, which can now be seen at our visitors center there. Note the two-story arrangement with a rope and bucket, the only link between the dungeon and the upper floor.</p>
<p>[A picture of the painting <i>Joseph in Liberty Jail</i> by Liz Lemon Swindle was shown.] Here is a painting by Liz Lemon Swindle showing Joseph in prayer. Note the forlorn, longing look on Josephs face.</p>
<p>[A picture of the painting <i>Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail</i> by Greg Olsen was shown.] And heres a portrayal by Greg Olsen showing how Joseph may have written some of the revelations that came during this imprisonment.</p>
<p>[A photo of the Toronto Ontario Canada Temple was shown.] And this is my final photo, which leads me to the <i>real</i> message I have come to give tonight.</p>
<h2><b>A Prison-Temple Experience</b></h2>
<p>Most of us, most of the time, speak of the facility at Liberty as a "jail" or a "prison" - and certainly it was that. But Elder Brigham H. Roberts, in recording the history of the Church, spoke of the facility as a temple, or, more accurately, a "prison-temple."<sup>8</sup> Elder Neal A. Maxwell used the same phrasing in some of his writings.<sup>9</sup> Certainly it lacked the purity, the beauty, the comfort, and the cleanliness of our true temples, our dedicated temples. The speech and behavior of the guards and criminals who came there was anything but templelike. In fact, the restricting brutality and injustice of this experience at Liberty would make it seem the very antithesis of the liberating, merciful spirit of our temples and the ordinances that are performed in them. So in what sense could Liberty Jail be called a "temple" - or at least a kind of temple - in the development of Joseph Smith personally and in his role as a prophet? And what does such a title tell us about Gods love and teachings, including where and when that love and those teachings are made manifest?</p>
<p>As we think on these things, does it strike us that spiritual experience, revelatory experience, sacred experience can come to every one of us in all the many and varied stages and circumstances of our lives if we want it, if we hold on and pray on, and if we keep our faith strong through our difficulties? We love and cherish our dedicated temples and the essential, exalting ordinances that are performed there. We thank heaven and the presiding Brethren that more and more of them are being built, giving more and more of us greater access to them. They are truly the holiest, most sacred structures in the kingdom of God, to which we all ought to go as worthily and as often as possible.</p>
<p>But tonights message is that when you have to, you can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in <i>any</i> situation you are in. Indeed, let me say that even a little stronger: You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord <i>in the most miserable experiences of your life - </i>in the worst settings, while enduring the most painful injustices, when facing the most insurmountable odds and opposition you have ever faced.</p>
<p>Now lets talk about those propositions for a moment. Every one of us, in one way or another, great or small, dramatic or incidental, is going to spend a little time in Liberty Jail - spiritually speaking. We will face things we do not want to face for reasons that may not have been our fault. Indeed, we may face difficult circumstances for reasons that were absolutely right and proper, reasons that came <i>because</i> we were trying to keep the commandments of the Lord. We may face persecution; we may endure heartache and separation from loved ones; we may be hungry and cold and forlorn. Yes, before our lives are over we may all be given a little taste of what the prophets faced often in their lives. But the lessons of the winter of 183839 teach us that <i>every</i> experience can become a <i>redemptive</i> experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty. These difficult lessons teach us that mans extremity is Gods opportunity, and if we will be humble and faithful, if we will be believing and not curse God for our problems, He can turn the unfair and inhumane and debilitating prisons of our lives into temples - or at least into a circumstance that can bring comfort and revelation, divine companionship and peace.</p>
<p>Let me push this just a little further. Ive just said that hard times <i>can</i> happen to us. President Joseph Fielding Smith, grandnephew of the Prophet Joseph and grandson of the incarcerated Hyrum, said something even stronger than that when he dedicated the Liberty Jail Visitors Center in 1963. Alluding to the kind of history weve reviewed tonight and looking on the scene where his grandfather and granduncle were so unjustly held, he said perhaps such things <i>have</i> to happen - not only can they happen, perhaps they have to. Said he:</p>
<p><i>As I have read the history of those days, the days that went before and days that came after, I have reached the conclusion that the hardships, the persecution, the almost universal opposition</i> [toward the Church at that time] <i>were</i> necessary. <i>At any rate they became school teachers to our people. They helped to make</i> [them] <i>strong.</i><sup>10</sup></p>
<h2><b>Lessons from Liberty Jail</b></h2>
<p>Well, without trying to determine which of these kinds of experiences in our life are "mandatory" and which are "optional" but still good for us, may I suggest just a very few of the lessons learned at Liberty - those experiences that were "school teachers" to Joseph and can be to us, experiences that contribute so much to our education in mortality and our exaltation in eternity.</p>
<p>In selecting these lessons I note yet another kind of blessing that came out of this adversity. To make the points that I am now going to try to make in my message to you, I have drawn directly upon the revelatory words that came from the lips of Joseph Smith during this heartbreaking time, words that we now have canonized as sacred scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants. I guess were not supposed to have favorite scriptures, and I have enough of them that you wont be able to pin me down to one or two, but certainly any list of my favorite scriptures would have to include those written from the darkness of Liberty Jail.</p>
<p>So what we instantly learn is that God was not only teaching Joseph Smith in that prison circumstance but He was teaching <i>all</i> of us, for generations yet to come. What a scriptural gift! And what a high price was paid for it! But how empty would our lives as Latter-day Saints be if we did not have sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you have not read them recently, I want you to read them tonight, or tomorrow at the latest - no later. That is your homework assignment, and I will be checking on you! They are contained in total on a mere six pages of text, but those six pages will touch your heart with their beauty and their power. And they will remind you that God often "moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform."<sup>11</sup> In any case, He certainly turned adversity into blessing in giving us those sacred writings and reflections, so pure, noble, and Christian in both tone and content, yet produced in such an impure, ignoble, and unchristian setting.</p>
<h2><b>1. Everyone Faces Trying Times</b></h2>
<p>Now then, three lessons from Liberty Jail: May I suggest that the first of these is inherent in what Ive already said - that everyone, including (and perhaps especially) the righteous, will be called upon to face trying times. When that happens we can sometimes fear God has abandoned us, and we might be left, at least for a time, to wonder when our troubles will ever end. As individuals, as families, as communities, and as nations, probably everyone has had or will have an occasion to feel as Joseph Smith felt when he asked why such sorrow had to come and how long its darkness and damage would remain. We identify with him when he cries from the depth and discouragement of his confinement:</p>
<p><i>O God, where art thou? . . .</i></p>
<p><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed . . . ?</i></p>
<p><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall</i> [thy people] <i>suffer . . . before . . . thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i> [D&amp;C 121:13]</p>
<p>That is a painful, personal cry - a cry from the heart, a spiritual loneliness we may all have occasion to feel at some time in our lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have had such moments already in your young lives. If so, I hope you have not had too many. But whenever these moments of our extremity come, we must not succumb to the fear that God has abandoned us or that He does not hear our prayers. He <i>does</i> hear us. He <i>does</i> see us. He <i>does</i> love us. When we are in dire circumstances and want to cry "Where art Thou?" it is imperative that we remember He is right there with us - where He has always been! We must continue to believe, continue to have faith, continue to pray and plead with heaven, even if we feel for a time our prayers are not heard and that God has somehow gone away. He <i>is</i> there. Our prayers <i>are</i> heard. And when we weep He and the angels of heaven weep with us.</p>
<p>When lonely, cold, hard times come, we have to endure, we have to continue, we have to persist. That was the Saviors message in the parable of the importuning widow (see Luke 18:18; see also Luke 11:510). Keep knocking on that door. Keep pleading. In the meantime, know that God hears your cries and knows your distress. He is your Father, and you are His child.</p>
<p>When what has to be has been and when what lessons to be learned have been learned, it will be for us as it was for the Prophet Joseph. Just at the time he felt most alone and distant from heavens ear was the very time he received the wonderful ministration of the Spirit and wonderful, glorious answers that came from his Father in Heaven. Into this dismal dungeon and this depressing time, the voice of God came, saying:</p>
<p><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i></p>
<p><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i> [D&amp;C 121:78]</p>
<p>Even though seemingly unjust circumstances may be heaped upon us and even though unkind and unmerited things may be done to us - perhaps by those we consider enemies but also, in some cases, by those whom we thought were friends - nevertheless, through it all, <i>God is with us.</i> That is why we had our marvelous choir sing tonight Sarah Adams traditional, old Christian hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee" with that seldom-sung fourth verse, which they sang so beautifully:</p>
<p><i>Out of my stony griefs</i></p>
<p><i>Bethel Ill raise;</i></p>
<p>So by my woes <i>to be</i></p>
<p><i>Nearer, my God, to thee.</i><sup>12</sup></p>
<p>We are not alone in our little prisons here. When suffering, we may in fact be nearer to God than weve ever been in our entire lives. <i>That</i> knowledge can turn every such situation into a would-be temple.</p>
<p>Regarding our earthly journey, the Lord has promised:</p>
<p><i>I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.</i> [D&amp;C 84:88]</p>
<p>That is an everlasting declaration of Gods love and care for us, including - and perhaps especially - in times of trouble.</p>
<h2><b>2. Even the Worthy Will Suffer</b></h2>
<p>Secondly, we need to realize that just because difficult things happen - sometimes unfair and seemingly unjustified things - it does not mean that we are unrighteous or that we are unworthy of blessings or that God is disappointed in us. Of course sinfulness does bring suffering, and the only answer to that behavior is repentance. But sometimes suffering comes to the righteous, too. You will recall that from the depths of Liberty Jail when Joseph was reminded that he had indeed been "cast . . . into trouble," had passed through tribulation and been falsely accused, had been torn away from his family and cast into a pit, into the hands of murderers, nevertheless, he was to remember that <i>the same thing had happened to the Savior of the world,</i> and because He was triumphant, so shall we be (see D&amp;C 122:47). In giving us this sober reminder of what the Savior went through, the revelation from Liberty Jail records: "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;C 122:8).</p>
<p>No. Joseph was not greater than the Savior, and neither are we. And when we promise to follow the Savior, to walk in His footsteps and be His disciples, we are promising to go where that divine path leads us. And the path of salvation has always led one way or another through Gethsemane. So if the Savior faced such injustices and discouragements, such persecutions, unrighteousness, and suffering, we cannot expect that we are not going to face some of that if we still intend to call ourselves His true disciples and faithful followers. And it certainly underscores the fact that the righteous - in the Saviors case, the personification of righteousness - can be totally worthy before God and still suffer.</p>
<p>In fact, it ought to be a matter of great doctrinal consolation to us that Jesus, in the course of the Atonement, experienced all of the heartache and sorrow, all of the disappointments and injustices that the entire family of man had experienced and would experience from Adam and Eve to the end of the world in order that we would not have to face them so severely or so deeply. However heavy our load might be, it would be a lot heavier if the Savior had not gone that way before us and carried that burden with us and for us.</p>
<p>Very early in the Prophet Josephs ministry, the Savior taught him this doctrine. After speaking of sufferings so exquisite to feel and so hard to bear, Jesus said:</p>
<p><i>I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they</i> [and that means you and I and everyone] <i>might not suffer if they would repent.</i> [D&amp;C 19:16]</p>
<p>In our moments of pain and trial, I guess we would shudder to think it could be worse, but the answer to that is clearly that it <i>could</i> be worse and it <i>would</i> be worse. Only through our faith and repentance and obedience to the gospel that provided the sacred Atonement is it kept from <i>being</i> worse.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we note that not only has the Savior suffered, in His case entirely innocently, but so have most of the prophets and other great men and women recorded in the scriptures. Name an Old Testament or Book of Mormon prophet, name a New Testament Apostle, name virtually any of the leaders in any dispensation, including our own, and you name someone who has had trouble.</p>
<p>My point? If you are having a bad day, youve got a lot of company - very, very good company. The best company that has ever lived.</p>
<p>Now, dont misunderstand. We dont have to look for sorrow. We dont have to seek to be martyrs. Trouble has a way of finding us even without our looking for it. But when it is obvious that a little time in Liberty Jail waits before you (spiritually speaking), remember these first two truths taught to Joseph in that prison-temple. First, God has <i>not</i> forgotten you, and second, the Savior has been where you have been, allowing Him to provide for your deliverance and your comfort.</p>
<p>As the prophet Isaiah wrote, the Lord has "graven thee upon the palms of [His] hands" (Isaiah 49:16), permanently written right there in scar tissue with Roman nails as the writing instrument. Having paid that price in the suffering that They have paid for you, the Father and the Son will never forget nor forsake you in your suffering. (See Isaiah 49:1416; see also 1 Nephi 21:1416.) They have planned, prepared, and guaranteed your victory if you desire it, so be believing and "endure it well" (D&amp;C 121:8). In the end it "shall be for thy good" (D&amp;C 122:7), and you will see "everlasting dominion" flow unto you forever and ever "without compulsory means" (D&amp;C 121:46).</p>
<h2><b>3. Remain Calm, Patient, Charitable, and Forgiving</b></h2>
<p>Thirdly, and tonight lastly, may I remind us all that in the midst of these difficult feelings when one could justifiably be angry or reactionary or vengeful, wanting to return an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, the Lord reminds us from the Liberty Jail prison-temple that</p>
<p><i>the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only</i> [or "except"] <i>upon the principles of righteousness.</i> [D&amp;C 121:36]</p>
<p>Therefore, even when we face such distressing circumstances in our life and there is something in us that wants to strike out at God or man or friend or foe, we must remember that "no power or influence <i>can</i> or <i>ought</i> to be maintained [except] by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; . . . without hypocrisy, and without guile" (D&amp;C 121:4142; emphasis added).</p>
<p>It has always been a wonderful testimony to me of the Prophet Josephs greatness and the greatness of all of our prophets, including and especially the Savior of the world in His magnificence, that in the midst of such distress and difficulty they could remain calm and patient, charitable, and forgiving - that they could even talk that way, let alone live that way. But they could, and they did. They remembered their covenants, they disciplined themselves, and they knew that we must live the gospel at all times, not just when it is convenient and not just when things are going well. Indeed, they knew that the real test of our faith and our Christian discipleship is when things are <i>not</i> going smoothly. That is when we get to see what were made of and how strong our commitment to the gospel really is.</p>
<p>Surely the classic example of this is that in the most painful hours of the Crucifixion the Savior could say, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). That is a hard thing to ask when were hurting. That is a hard thing to do when weve been offended or are tired or stressed out or suffering innocently. But that is when Christian behavior may matter the most. Remember, "the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled [except] upon the principles of righteousness." And do we need the powers of heaven with us at such times! As Joseph was taught in this prison-temple, even in distress and sorrow we must "let [our] bowels . . . be full of charity towards all men . . .  ; then [and only then] shall [our] confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and . . . the Holy Ghost shall be [our] constant companion" (D&amp;C 121:4546).</p>
<p>Remaining true to our Christian principles is the only way divine influence can help us. The Spirit has a near-impossible task to get through to a heart that is filled with hate or anger or vengeance or self-pity. Those are all antithetical to the Spirit of the Lord. On the other hand, the Spirit finds instant access to a heart striving to be charitable and forgiving, long-suffering and kind - principles of true discipleship. What a testimony that gospel principles are to apply at all times and in all situations and that if we strive to remain faithful, the triumph of a Christian life can never be vanquished, no matter how grim the circumstance might be. How I love the majesty of these elegant, celestial teachings taught, ironically, in such a despicable setting and time.</p>
<h2><b>Do All Things Cheerfully</b></h2>
<p>As a valedictory to the lessons from Liberty Jail, I refer to the last verse of the last section of these three we have been referring to tonight. In this final canonized statement of the Liberty Jail experience, the Lord says to us through His prophet, Joseph Smith:</p>
<p><i>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren</i> [and sisters, when we are in even the most troubling of times], <i>let us</i> cheerfully <i>do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i> [D&amp;C 123:17; emphasis added]</p>
<p>What a tremendously optimistic and faithful concluding declaration to be issued from a prison-temple! When he wrote those lines, Joseph did not know when he would be released or if he would ever be released. There was every indication that his enemies were still planning to take his life. Furthermore, his wife and children were alone, frightened, often hungry, wondering how they would fend for themselves without their husband and father. The Saints, too, were without homes and without their prophet. They were leaving Missouri, heading for Illinois, but who knew what tragedies were awaiting them there? Surely, to say it again, it was the bleakest and darkest of times.</p>
<p>Yet in these cold, lonely hours, Joseph says let us do all we can <i>and do it cheerfully.</i> And then we can justifiably turn to the Lord, wait upon His mercy, and see His arm revealed in our behalf.</p>
<p>What a magnificent attitude to maintain in good times or bad, in sorrow or in joy!</p>
<h2><b>Blessing and Testimony</b></h2>
<p>My beloved young friends, as part of my concluding testimony to you tonight, I wish to give you a blessing. It seems to me that as our apostolic witnesses are taken into the world, we have two opportunities and, indeed, perhaps obligations. One is to testify and bear witness, as I have been trying to do and will conclude in doing. The other is to bless - as the ancient Apostles did when the Savior invited them to do as He had done, except that it would be in all the world.</p>
<p>So for every one of you in attendance tonight - here in this vast auditorium or in other locations around the world - I bless every one of you, each one of you in your individual circumstances, as if my hands were on your head. I offer that to you as honestly as I offer my testimony. I bless you in the name of the Lord that God does love you, does hear your prayers, is at your side, and will never leave you.</p>
<p>I bless the brethren that you - that we - will be worthy of the priesthood we bear, that we will live true to the discipleship to which we have been called, in that great order, the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. I bless you that we will really be like the Master - that we will think more like He thinks, that we will talk more like He talks, and that we will do more of what He did. I bless you brethren as you strive to be faithful that you will have all the blessings of the priesthood, many of which we have quoted tonight from these very sections from the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
<p>I bless the sisters within this audience and within the sound of my voice. I would have you know how much we cherish you, how much God cherishes you, and how much the flag of faith has been flown by the sisters of this Church from the beginning. In every generation, it would seem, from the beginning of time down to the present hour and beyond, so often it has been the women in our lives - our grandmothers, our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our sisters, our granddaughters - who have taken that torch of faith and that banner of beautiful living and have carried gospel principles wherever it would take them, against whatever hardship, into their own little equivalent of Liberty Jails and difficult times. Sisters, we love you and honor you and bless you. We ask that every righteous desire of your heart, tonight and forever, be answered upon your head and that you will walk away from this devotional with the understanding and the knowledge firmly in your heart as to how much God and heaven and the presiding Brethren of this Church love you and honor you.</p>
<p>I salute you young adults of this Church in this great CES congregation and say that the future is in your hands. Those of us of my generation have to, in the very near future, pass the baton to you. God bless you to face those times with the valor, the honesty, and the integrity we have spoken of here tonight.</p>
<p>In closing, I testify that the Father and the Son do live. And I testify that They are close, perhaps even closest via the Holy Spirit, when we are experiencing difficult times. I testify (and as our closing musical number, "My Kindness Shall Not Depart from Thee," will testify, quoting the prophet Isaiah) that heavens kindness will <i>never</i> depart from you, regardless of what happens (see Isaiah 54:710; see also 3 Nephi 22:710). I testify that bad days come to an end, that faith always triumphs, and that heavenly promises are always kept. I testify that God is our Father, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is the true and living gospel - found in this, the true and living Church. I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God, our prophet for this hour and this day. I love him and sustain him as I know you do. In the words of the Liberty Jail prison-temple experience, my young friends, "Hold on thy way. . . . Fear not . . . , for God shall be with you forever and ever" (D&amp;C 122:9). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning. I am humbled to stand where prophets, apostles, General Authorities, university presidents, important scholars, and world leaders have stood. As a student at BYU thirty years ago, I attended the devotionals and forums quite faithfully. I loved taking a break once a week to listen to remarkable individuals share their insights on a myriad of topics. I enjoyed listening and learning without any worry that I might be tested on what I was hearing. It was education at its best.
I am what I used to refer to as the dark horse in the devotional lineup. A dark horse is a completely unknown quantity with no name recognition whatsoever. You are probably like one of my students who looked at the list of speakers for the semester and asked, "Why are you on the list?"
My response to her was, "I dont know! Ive been asking myself the same question!" But whatever the reason, I am here, and I hope that something I share this morning will move you to open your hearts to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost and that you will be encouraged in your efforts to follow our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The Invitation
One of my favorite scriptures is found in Matthew 11. It is Christs universal invitation that speaks to each of us personally:
 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. [Matthew 11:2830]
I love this passage because in a few short verses Christ lays before us the path to eternal life. The overtones and undertones of these verses resonate with truth. First, the very fact that this is an invitation to "come," to "take," and to "learn" indicates an acknowledgment of and a respect for our agency. This respect for agency causes me to think of our premortal life, when we fought in our Fathers army to preserve and maintain the condition of agency in this life. It seems right that Christ, who is the linchpin in our Fathers plan of happiness, would acknowledge that it is our choice to come unto Him or not.
I also appreciate the simple promise of rest that is given. Having labored under sin and its heavy weight of guilt and separation from God, I am grateful for the rest and reconciliation Christ promises to those who come unto Him.
I find great meaning in the word yoke. It evokes so many important things about Christs path. A yoke is a wooden bar or frame by which two draft animals are joined at the neck for the purpose of working together to pull a heavy load. A yoke is also a frame fitted to a persons shoulders to carry a load in two equal portions. Whether we envision a double or a single yoke, the Savior is part of this image. We are either teamed with Him, side by side, or we are carrying His yoke. Yokes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Welcome to fall semester. We hope you have all been able to settle into your new schedules. Fall semester can be a time of fresh starts. It can be a time of great expectations. It can also be a time when things are practically perfect. For example, it is probably safe to say that right now most of you have perfect grades in all of your classes! It can be a time when hopes run high and your roommate situation is quite fabulous. It is a time when all of our athletic teams are on course for tremendous seasons - yes, even perhaps national championships! And it is a time when you are able to meet new people, even perhaps that special someone.
The beginning of fall semester can indeed be an exciting time. You are most likely focused on a course of study and ready for what this new semester has to offer. We are excited for you! We hope that all of your expectations are met and that your experience here is a wonderfully memorable one. We also hope that as you are here at Brigham Young University and after you leave to pursue your own course in life, you will always take great care to do those things that will keep you out of harms way, both temporally and spiritually; that you will have proper focus and perspective; and that you will heed the counsel of Nephis brother Jacob, who said to his family, "O be wise; what can I say more?" (Jacob 6:12).
Sometimes as we embark and proceed on a new journey we find that our expectations are not met. What we had anticipated and hoped for in the beginning of our journey has not come to pass. Our ideals are not our realities. Maybe we are not getting the grades we had hoped for or we havent met that special someone. Perhaps we didnt get the job we thought we deserved. We may find that things are just not working out as we had planned. The question then becomes, What will be our reaction to our unanticipated situation? What will we do? This is where I believe Jacobs counsel to "be wise" deserves serious attention.
At times, in these situations, the easiest thing to do is to place the responsibility for our situation on something or someone else. This is a dangerous course to take. It is harmful. It is extremely unwise. We see this in the Book of Mormon when people blamed their behavior on the traditions of their fathers. Not accepting responsibility for the direction of our own lives can distort our perceptions and can cause us to lose focus of the things that are important. It can cause us to become disoriented and can keep us from progressing. It is a waste of valuable time in these days of our earthly probation.
Another easy but unwise thing we might do during unforeseen situations is obsess about things we cant control. Recently I read about "a thrill-seeking photographer" who was described as a person who "often diced with death in the water."1 He would repeatedly put himself into very dangerous situations in order to capture footage of </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am humbled and thankful to be among so many friends today and to see so many of my current and former students. Thank you for this opportunity, President Worthen.
I grew up on a large cattle ranch, first near Eureka, Nevada, and later in Kanosh, Utah. I would start the days very early by catching and saddling my horse in the moonlit and frosty morning hours. As the first rays of sunshine would start coming over the mountains, the cowboys I was working with would scatter out and begin looking for cows and calves from among sagebrush flats and juniper-covered hillsides. The sight was surreal as I would watch hundreds of cows and calves being herded toward a corral to be branded and vaccinated.
As a young boy I aspired to be able to rope the calves as my part of the branding. Alternative responsibilities entailed wrestling the calves to the ground, oftentimes resulting in me getting kicked or run over. At about the age of seven, after repeated failures in tackling the calves, I was finally allowed to try my hand at roping. I remember proudly getting my lasso rope ready and searching out the smallest and slowest-looking calf in the herd. I carefully planned my throw, and I felt the thrill of accomplishment when the loop settled over the calf successfully. Though the calf was seemingly small and slow, I felt its tremendous force start to jerk me off my horse. Despite trying my best to hold onto the calf, I found that my strength was no match for him. Just as I was being violently jerked out of my saddle, I heard a wise cowboy yell across to me: "Dally up!"
To dally means to take the rope and making two or three quick wraps around the saddle horn. The saddle becomes an anchor point, which connects to the greater strength of a steady and powerful horse. The dally transformed my situation of having inadequate personal strength to being able to access a greater power that anchored the turbulent polar forces acting upon me. This simple act allowed me to draw strength from something far greater than myself. Instead of being violently yanked from my saddle, I found the relative ease of letting my horse do the pulling while I had the much more simple and manageable task of holding the dally tight and maintaining the connection to the anchoring force.
Many times in my life since then I have felt the strength of greater powers than I have been prepared to withstand. These have seemed to yank me from a place of security and comfort. Each time, I have reflected upon opportunities to dally up to a power greater than my own that can serve as an anchor of strength. I would like to share some of the points of my learning about how to dally up in our inevitable circumstances and the need to find our anchor during turbulent times in our lives:
1. Strength in service
2. Strength in involvement
3. Strength in commitments
Strength in Service

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As an adjunct professor who has taught at BYU for several years, I am in awe of this amazing institution that attracts the finest, most extraordinary faculty and stu-dents on the planet.
I honor you and believe that King Benjamin could have easily been describing you when he said:
And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual. [Mosiah 2:41]
Yes, you are awesome, and this could be the most important assignment I have ever had as a professional speaker. Consequently, I wanted to be at my best.
However, as I was getting ready this morning, I noticed that I was losing hair on my head and growing it in my nose and ears and on my back - in places I dont even need it. That is not a fair trade-off. My only hope this morning was that the hair in my right ear would grow long enough so that I could comb it up over the top of my head and fake all of you out! It didnt happen.
When President Worthen asked me to speak to you today, two life-altering experiences surfaced in my mind, helping me focus my remarks. First, I recently returned from an eighteen-day military tribute tour with my invited guests American Idol finalist/Sony recording artist David Archuleta; world-class musician, vocal coach, and musical director Dean Kaelin; and celebrity impressionist Jason Hewlett. We performed our Evening of Music, Comedy, and Motivational Theater to fourteen amazing audiences; held six firesides for the U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Kuwait along the Iraqi border; and concluded the tour with a special visit to the missionaries, members, and investigators in Ethiopia. We were touched by the dedication of Church members and the fearless commitment to service before self of our brave men and women in uniform. And when we got shot at and returned machine gun fire during one of our flights in a Chinook helicopter to a remote forward operating base, I realized that we should never take our freedom for granted and was reminded of the sense of urgency with which we all should live our lives.
The second life-altering experience happened on October 23, 2010, when I had the rare opportunity to soar to the edge of space in a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Because it was a classified mission, I can only tell you that at 70,000 feet you can see two-thirds of the state of California. At 80,000 feet you can see some distinctly mapped outlines of America. And at 90,000 feet you tear up and feel like you can reach out and touch the face of God! It was a spiritual experience I wish each of you could have.
For four hours I sat in the sounds of silence, looking at the breathtaking curvature of the earth, gazing into the endless blackness of space, pondering eternity, and reflecting on President Dieter F. Uchtdorfs reminder that we are more </span>
