  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a blessing and an honor to be asked to speak to you today. I never dreamed of having such a great opportunity as this, and I pray that the Spirit will be with both of us. I am just a country kid from Moroni, Utah, so this is extraordinary for me.

As I prayed about what I should talk about today, I had many topics come into my mind. It was hard to decide what would be best for you as well as something I’m passionate about. The letter I received said that I should pick a topic that is important to me.

One of my favorite candies is M&amp;amp;M’s, and one of my favorite interests is missionary work. So, with those in mind, I started to think of the M&amp;amp;M’s of missionary-minded members, for that is what I am involved in as a stake president.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Miraculous Conversion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The first M&amp;amp;M that I want to address is &lt;b&gt;miraculous conversion.&lt;/b&gt;When I hear that phrase I think of Alma, Ammon, Wilford Woodruff, Paul, and other great missionaries, and then I think, “That’s way above me,” and I turn it off. But this is the start of the sweetness of missionary desires.

I came from a family in Moroni that wasn’t active. I can’t remember sitting in a ­sacrament meeting with my mom and dad. My dad would always pound on the furnace register to make sure I got up for church, but there were long stretches when I can’t remember going to church. My dad was a schoolteacher, so in the summers we’d go fishing or hiking or camping or anything else—just not church. One time, after being gone all summer, I went to church, and Veldon Blackburn, a friend of mine, asked why I had gone inactive. I told him I wasn’t inactive; I just didn’t come to church.

During the summer a few years later I worked hard to be the best and get the best job in Moroni, which was working on the vaccination crew for the Moroni Feed Company. I worked really hard and made the crew. We could go through a flock of ten thousand turkeys in an hour and not lose one. One time we were vaccinating some turkeys up by Fountain Green, and they were just a little bigger than usual. We were taking them out of the brooder coop, vaccinating them, putting them into a truck, and taking them out to the growing pens. We had finished vaccinating about half the flock when I grabbed a turkey, gave it a shot, and threw it up into the truck. As I grabbed another turkey, the last turkey decided it didn’t want to be in the truck, so it came out and hit me in the back of my arm, and I gave myself the next shot in my hand between my thumb and index finger. I will now never get fowl cholera, erysipelas, or Newcastle disease.

I grew a big abscess about the size of a ­tennis ball in the palm of my hand, so I went to the family doctor, Dr. Speakman, in Mount Pleasant. After a few months of lancing the abscess and getting the gunk out of it, the doctor said he would have to take three of my fingers off to save my hand. I’m kind of attached to those fingers—and they make it much easier to play the guitar! I told Dr. Speakman that I wanted to speak to my dad. He worked just up the street in the school district office, so Dr. Speakman left the room to contact him. As soon as he left I started to really pray—­probably the first sincere prayer of my life. Before the doctor came back in with my dad, I knew what my dad was going to say and what he was going to do. I knew that I would not lose my fingers or my hand. A calm and a peace had settled over me, and I just knew I would be okay.

That day I made some promises to the Lord: (1) I would live the Word of Wisdom to the best of my knowledge and ability, and (2) I would serve Him all of my life (I didn’t realize people lived so long). Back then that meant I would serve a mission. Both of these promises I have worked hard to keep.

My dad took me out of the office and put me in the car, and we went straight to Provo to a specialist—Dr. Aaron. The hand took over a year to heal. In fact, the next summer, when I was in basic training, I remember leaving blood on the rocks in the field where we did push-ups.

I had had a simple prayer answered, and I knew it, and the important thing is that I knew the Lord knew me. I can’t explain the peace and comfort that came over me in the doctor’s office that day. It took a few years to even understand what had really happened that day in that office, but it has made all the difference in my life—and for a seventeen-year-old kid in a small town hanging around the friends I had, keeping the Word of Wisdom was a big challenge.

No one in my family had ever gone on a mission. It was not expected of us. So when I announced I wanted to serve a mission, it surprised many. It may have even shaken a few testimonies. I had another hurdle to overcome though, because in those days the government would only let two missionaries out from a ward at any one time, and I had a lot of friends whose parents were active who would fill up that quota. So I joined the Army National Guard so that I would not have to take one of those spots for missionaries.

My miraculous conversion was nothing more than the answer to a simple but very sincere prayer. I interview many young people for missions these days, and I ask them if they have asked in prayer what the Lord would want them to do about going on a mission. I am surprised by how many don’t ask. Most are just going along with the next step in their life, trying to make the best decisions they can. It is important to know what the Lord wants of you.

A couple of years ago in the Mount Pleasant North Stake we couldn’t get our young men to go on missions. We only had nine missionaries out from our stake, and that’s not very many. So we prayed about it and really made a push for more missionaries. Seven young ladies stepped up and sent their missionary applications in, and at that point we had as many young ladies as young men on missions.

I just released the first two of those young ladies this last week. What powerful missionaries they have become! But what is really exciting and neat is the great mothers they will become for the next generation of missionaries.

The sweetness of this M&amp;amp;M is so important that I want to tell you about my last son, Kyle. He is a great kid. When he was sixteen he started to be a cowboy and started to ride bulls—and there is only one thing stupider than a bull. When Kyle turned nineteen, I filled out his papers for his mission—and those papers sat. Some of his friends got things together and left on their missions, but not Kyle. I think we filled out two sets of mission papers for him, and then when he was coming up on twenty-one, I threw out all his papers.

Later that year he came to me asking where his missionary papers were, and I hit the fan. I told him that I was sick and tired of his hypocrisy and that I didn’t want him to go on a mission—in fact, I didn’t care if he ever went on a mission. Then it flashed before me that I was going to heck for treating my son so rotten and preventing him from going on a mission instead of bringing salvation to his soul. So I asked him if he had been praying about a mission. He told me that he had been putting a lot of thought into it and had had some feelings about going. That wasn’t good enough. I had heard that before, so I told him he had to find out what the Lord wanted him to do. I was very heated throughout this conversation, and it would have been very easy for Kyle to say, “Well, so much for that.” But he didn’t. He had been feeling something, and I think the Spirit had already touched his life. He did go on a mission and is now married to a great young lady, and their second boy is on the way.

It is not a big thing. It is the small whisper. “Miraculous” is anything coming from the Lord, for He is the giver of all good gifts. As it says in Doctrine and Covenants 4:7, “Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Amen.”
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. “A Marvellous Work and a Wonder”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The second M&amp;amp;M is &lt;b&gt;“a marvellous work and a wonder.”&lt;/b&gt;Isaiah 29:14 states: “Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder.” In Jacob 5 in the Book of Mormon we read the allegory of the olive tree. Verse 6 says, “After many days”; verse 15 says, “A long time passed away”; and verse 29 says, “A long time had passed away.” But in the last few verses of this long chapter we read about “the Lord of the vineyard” doing what He had done before, except this time He worked alongside the servants. He did not leave the vineyard or the servants again:

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.&lt;/i&gt; [Jacob 5:70–72]

Just think about who is in charge of this work and what has happened in the few short years since the Restoration. The Church is covering all the earth. We are still but few, but look at the marvelous work and wonder that has happened. Doctrine and Covenants 4:1 says, “Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.” That is true today more than ever before. We are witnessing that coming to pass. We are not only witnesses to it happening, we are also participants in it.

Doctrine and Covenants 88:72–73 states:

&lt;i&gt;Behold, and lo, I will take care of your flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.&lt;/i&gt;

Is it time? Every one of you will remember where you were when you heard President Thomas S. Monson’s timeless declaration that lowered the age for missionary service. I even remember where I was and the date when it was announced that all worthy males would be able to hold the priesthood. I was west of Hanksville, Utah, just before you get to Caineville. It was June 10, 1978. That was a ­pivotal point for the Church, but this announcement is also far-reaching and will prove to be eternal in its consequences.

The greatest part of being seventeen was that I knew everything. I was on top of my world. But I soon found out that there was something greater than myself, and I wanted to keep the promises I had made. In Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 we read:

&lt;i&gt;Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.&lt;/i&gt;

This marvelous work and a wonder took on new meaning for me. It became my greater cause.

Doctrine and Covenants 128:22 reads:

&lt;i&gt;Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.&lt;/i&gt;

The most important part of the marvelous work and a wonder is the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. I have a 1914 edition of the Book of Mormon. It was given to me only a couple of years ago by the daughter of Leland Erastus Anderson. The miracle of this book is that the inside cover of the book has a note showing that it was given to my grandfather by his uncle Hyrum Smith Arnoldsen, which gave me a tie to know the power of the Book of Mormon in missionary work. You see, there are two branches of the same family represented here—an active, faithful branch and a wayward branch—and there is nothing more powerful than the Book of Mormon and the covenants of the temple to bring a family together again. A talk on the Book of Mormon is a whole different talk, but the importance of it cannot go unnoticed when it comes to a marvelous work and a wonder. President Ezra Taft Benson stated:

&lt;i&gt;The time is long overdue for a massive ­flooding of the earth with the Book of Mormon for the many reasons which the Lord has given. In this age of ­electronic media and mass distribution of the printed word, God will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a ­monumental way.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We have the Book of Mormon, we have the members, we have the missionaries, we have the resources, and the world has the need. The time is now! . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have a vision of homes alerted, of classes alive, and of pulpits aflame with the spirit of Book of Mormon messages.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have a vision of home teachers and visiting teachers, ward and branch officers, and stake and mission leaders counseling our people out of the most correct of any book on earth—the Book of Mormon.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have a vision of artists putting into film, drama, literature, music, and paintings great themes and great characters from the Book of Mormon.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have a vision of thousands of missionaries going into the mission field with hundreds of passages memorized from the Book of Mormon so that they might feed the needs of a spiritually famished world.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I have a vision of the whole Church getting nearer to God by abiding by the precepts of the Book of Mormon.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Indeed, I have a vision of flooding the earth with the Book of Mormon. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I do not know fully why God has preserved my life to this age, but I do know this: That for the present hour He has revealed to me the absolute need for us to move the Book of Mormon forward now in a marvelous manner. You must help with this burden and with this blessing which He has placed on the whole Church, even all the children of Zion.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Moses never entered the promised land. Joseph Smith never saw Zion redeemed. Some of us may not live long enough to see the day when the Book of Mormon floods the earth and when the Lord lifts His condemnation. (See D&amp;amp;C 84:54–58.) But, God willing, I intend to spend all my remaining days in that glorious effort.&lt;/i&gt; [“Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, November 1988, 4–6]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Magnify the Work—Self-Salvation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third M&amp;amp;M is &lt;b&gt;magnify.&lt;/b&gt; In Doctrine and Covenants 4:4 we read:

&lt;i&gt;For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul.&lt;/i&gt;

The gospel is as true today as it was in 1829, when this section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given. A mission is not a saving ordinance, but it does bring salvation to the soul. I have been home from my mission for forty-one years now, and a day has not gone by that I have not been blessed because of my mission. The mission only lasted two years, but forty years later it has not dimmed with time. If it only brought salvation to one soul—mine—it was worth it.

Doctrine and Covenants 84 shares some insights into what we can expect as blessings from the Lord start to flow into our lives:

&lt;i&gt;For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 84:33–38]

All the Father hath—what more is there?

Again from Doctrine and Covenants 4, in verse 2, we read:

&lt;i&gt;Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.&lt;/i&gt;

If you serve God with “all your heart, might, mind and strength,” you can stand before God blameless at the last day. Let me submit to you that the last day can be the last day of your mission or the last day of any calling you might receive. That great and last day is going to be glorious if, on the last day of every calling, you have served the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I remember coming home off my mission and thinking I had served with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. Now I wasn’t the shiniest candy in the bowl during my mission, but I did the best I could, and I have tried to do the same thing with every calling I have received since.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Money Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The final M&amp;amp;M is for &lt;b&gt;money management.&lt;/b&gt; It is not the most critical factor in determining a mission, but it can define and definitely be mind consuming. Any young person who comes with the desire to serve a mission can definitely find funding. But don’t take it for granted. I think the Lord expects us to do all we can to prepare financially and not leave it up to someone else.

When I started working for Snow College in 1983, we had taken a big cut in pay to move home. We about starved that first year, but we came up with a plan for saving for our kids’ missions. Our first two children were girls, and then the next five were boys. We always planned on the boys going on missions, so we saved a little bit each month for their missions, and we also had a plan to have our home paid off by the time they started to serve.

When my second daughter said she would like to serve a mission, it was at the same time my oldest son was getting ready for his mission. They both received their mission calls the same day. My daughter entered the MTC two weeks before my son, and they were in the MTC at the same time. Daina went to Mexico City and Phillip went to Kiev, Ukraine. We had the money for Phillip, but we didn’t have a dime for Daina.

From the week before Daina entered the MTC to her last week in the mission field, we did not pay a full mission payment for her. It was amazing. People would come up to us and say, “You need this more than I do,” and a couple of businesses in Mount Pleasant paid a full mission payment four or five times. Even my parents stepped up. Daina’s mission was completely paid for this way.

When Daina got home I thought we were going to get rich off these missions. Not one more dime ever came in, but what a blessing those donations were. I can’t help but feel it was because we had planned and saved for many years, and the Lord did the rest of what we couldn’t do.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Missionary work is exactly what it is: hard, scary, consuming, exciting, fulfilling, and many other words.

However, just like the candy M&amp;amp;M’s come in so many colors but all taste the same, missionary work looks different for every person but all leads to the same thing—bringing souls unto Christ. You can come up with your own M&amp;amp;M’s, and I’m sure there are a lot more &lt;i&gt;M &lt;/i&gt;words out there that can represent ­missionary-minded members. It still all comes down to the work of the Savior.

&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;iraculous conversion—just a simple prayer.

&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;arvelous work and a wonder—the Book of Mormon, such a great cause.

&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;agnify—all the Father has.

&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;oney management—knowing whose work this really is.

I know God lives. This is His great plan of happiness that the world needs. I know that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The fruits are before you. I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the prophet today and that this is the Savior’s kingdom upon the earth with an eternal mission to accomplish.

Now that I am getting closer to going on a mission again, I find that my wife and I are challenged with the same issues and the same concerns about a mission that I had when I was seventeen years old. But now I know. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>It is a blessing and an honor to be asked to speak to you today. I never dreamed of having such a great opportunity as this, and I pray that the Spirit will be with both of us. I am just a country kid from Moroni, Utah, so this is extraordinary for me.</p>
<p>As I prayed about what I should talk about today, I had many topics come into my mind. It was hard to decide what would be best for you as well as something I’m passionate about. The letter I received said that I should pick a topic that is important to me.</p>
<p>One of my favorite candies is M&amp;M’s, and one of my favorite interests is missionary work. So, with those in mind, I started to think of the M&amp;M’s of missionary-minded members, for that is what I am involved in as a stake president.</p>
<h2><b>1. Miraculous Conversion</b></h2>
<p>The first M&amp;M that I want to address is <b>miraculous conversion.</b>When I hear that phrase I think of Alma, Ammon, Wilford Woodruff, Paul, and other great missionaries, and then I think, “That’s way above me,” and I turn it off. But this is the start of the sweetness of missionary desires.</p>
<p>I came from a family in Moroni that wasn’t active. I can’t remember sitting in a ­sacrament meeting with my mom and dad. My dad would always pound on the furnace register to make sure I got up for church, but there were long stretches when I can’t remember going to church. My dad was a schoolteacher, so in the summers we’d go fishing or hiking or camping or anything else—just not church. One time, after being gone all summer, I went to church, and Veldon Blackburn, a friend of mine, asked why I had gone inactive. I told him I wasn’t inactive; I just didn’t come to church.</p>
<p>During the summer a few years later I worked hard to be the best and get the best job in Moroni, which was working on the vaccination crew for the Moroni Feed Company. I worked really hard and made the crew. We could go through a flock of ten thousand turkeys in an hour and not lose one. One time we were vaccinating some turkeys up by Fountain Green, and they were just a little bigger than usual. We were taking them out of the brooder coop, vaccinating them, putting them into a truck, and taking them out to the growing pens. We had finished vaccinating about half the flock when I grabbed a turkey, gave it a shot, and threw it up into the truck. As I grabbed another turkey, the last turkey decided it didn’t want to be in the truck, so it came out and hit me in the back of my arm, and I gave myself the next shot in my hand between my thumb and index finger. I will now never get fowl cholera, erysipelas, or Newcastle disease.</p>
<p>I grew a big abscess about the size of a ­tennis ball in the palm of my hand, so I went to the family doctor, Dr. Speakman, in Mount Pleasant. After a few months of lancing the abscess and getting the gunk out of it, the doctor said he would have to take three of my fingers off to save my hand. I’m kind of attached to those fingers—and they make it much easier to play the guitar! I told Dr. Speakman that I wanted to speak to my dad. He worked just up the street in the school district office, so Dr. Speakman left the room to contact him. As soon as he left I started to really pray—­probably the first sincere prayer of my life. Before the doctor came back in with my dad, I knew what my dad was going to say and what he was going to do. I knew that I would not lose my fingers or my hand. A calm and a peace had settled over me, and I just knew I would be okay.</p>
<p>That day I made some promises to the Lord: (1) I would live the Word of Wisdom to the best of my knowledge and ability, and (2) I would serve Him all of my life (I didn’t realize people lived so long). Back then that meant I would serve a mission. Both of these promises I have worked hard to keep.</p>
<p>My dad took me out of the office and put me in the car, and we went straight to Provo to a specialist—Dr. Aaron. The hand took over a year to heal. In fact, the next summer, when I was in basic training, I remember leaving blood on the rocks in the field where we did push-ups.</p>
<p>I had had a simple prayer answered, and I knew it, and the important thing is that I knew the Lord knew me. I can’t explain the peace and comfort that came over me in the doctor’s office that day. It took a few years to even understand what had really happened that day in that office, but it has made all the difference in my life—and for a seventeen-year-old kid in a small town hanging around the friends I had, keeping the Word of Wisdom was a big challenge.</p>
<p>No one in my family had ever gone on a mission. It was not expected of us. So when I announced I wanted to serve a mission, it surprised many. It may have even shaken a few testimonies. I had another hurdle to overcome though, because in those days the government would only let two missionaries out from a ward at any one time, and I had a lot of friends whose parents were active who would fill up that quota. So I joined the Army National Guard so that I would not have to take one of those spots for missionaries.</p>
<p>My miraculous conversion was nothing more than the answer to a simple but very sincere prayer. I interview many young people for missions these days, and I ask them if they have asked in prayer what the Lord would want them to do about going on a mission. I am surprised by how many don’t ask. Most are just going along with the next step in their life, trying to make the best decisions they can. It is important to know what the Lord wants of you.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago in the Mount Pleasant North Stake we couldn’t get our young men to go on missions. We only had nine missionaries out from our stake, and that’s not very many. So we prayed about it and really made a push for more missionaries. Seven young ladies stepped up and sent their missionary applications in, and at that point we had as many young ladies as young men on missions.</p>
<p>I just released the first two of those young ladies this last week. What powerful missionaries they have become! But what is really exciting and neat is the great mothers they will become for the next generation of missionaries.</p>
<p>The sweetness of this M&amp;M is so important that I want to tell you about my last son, Kyle. He is a great kid. When he was sixteen he started to be a cowboy and started to ride bulls—and there is only one thing stupider than a bull. When Kyle turned nineteen, I filled out his papers for his mission—and those papers sat. Some of his friends got things together and left on their missions, but not Kyle. I think we filled out two sets of mission papers for him, and then when he was coming up on twenty-one, I threw out all his papers.</p>
<p>Later that year he came to me asking where his missionary papers were, and I hit the fan. I told him that I was sick and tired of his hypocrisy and that I didn’t want him to go on a mission—in fact, I didn’t care if he ever went on a mission. Then it flashed before me that I was going to heck for treating my son so rotten and preventing him from going on a mission instead of bringing salvation to his soul. So I asked him if he had been praying about a mission. He told me that he had been putting a lot of thought into it and had had some feelings about going. That wasn’t good enough. I had heard that before, so I told him he had to find out what the Lord wanted him to do. I was very heated throughout this conversation, and it would have been very easy for Kyle to say, “Well, so much for that.” But he didn’t. He had been feeling something, and I think the Spirit had already touched his life. He did go on a mission and is now married to a great young lady, and their second boy is on the way.</p>
<p>It is not a big thing. It is the small whisper. “Miraculous” is anything coming from the Lord, for He is the giver of all good gifts. As it says in Doctrine and Covenants 4:7, “Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Amen.”</p>
<h2><b>2. “A Marvellous Work and a Wonder”</b></h2>
<p>The second M&amp;M is <b>“a marvellous work and a wonder.”</b>Isaiah 29:14 states: “Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder.” In Jacob 5 in the Book of Mormon we read the allegory of the olive tree. Verse 6 says, “After many days”; verse 15 says, “A long time passed away”; and verse 29 says, “A long time had passed away.” But in the last few verses of this long chapter we read about “the Lord of the vineyard” doing what He had done before, except this time He worked alongside the servants. He did not leave the vineyard or the servants again:</p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few.</i></p>
<p><i>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.</i> [Jacob 5:70–72]</p>
<p>Just think about who is in charge of this work and what has happened in the few short years since the Restoration. The Church is covering all the earth. We are still but few, but look at the marvelous work and wonder that has happened. Doctrine and Covenants 4:1 says, “Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.” That is true today more than ever before. We are witnessing that coming to pass. We are not only witnesses to it happening, we are also participants in it.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 88:72–73 states:</p>
<p><i>Behold, and lo, I will take care of your flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them.</i></p>
<p><i>Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.</i></p>
<p>Is it time? Every one of you will remember where you were when you heard President Thomas S. Monson’s timeless declaration that lowered the age for missionary service. I even remember where I was and the date when it was announced that all worthy males would be able to hold the priesthood. I was west of Hanksville, Utah, just before you get to Caineville. It was June 10, 1978. That was a ­pivotal point for the Church, but this announcement is also far-reaching and will prove to be eternal in its consequences.</p>
<p>The greatest part of being seventeen was that I knew everything. I was on top of my world. But I soon found out that there was something greater than myself, and I wanted to keep the promises I had made. In Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 we read:</p>
<p><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i></p>
<p><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i></p>
<p>This marvelous work and a wonder took on new meaning for me. It became my greater cause.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 128:22 reads:</p>
<p><i>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.</i></p>
<p>The most important part of the marvelous work and a wonder is the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. I have a 1914 edition of the Book of Mormon. It was given to me only a couple of years ago by the daughter of Leland Erastus Anderson. The miracle of this book is that the inside cover of the book has a note showing that it was given to my grandfather by his uncle Hyrum Smith Arnoldsen, which gave me a tie to know the power of the Book of Mormon in missionary work. You see, there are two branches of the same family represented here—an active, faithful branch and a wayward branch—and there is nothing more powerful than the Book of Mormon and the covenants of the temple to bring a family together again. A talk on the Book of Mormon is a whole different talk, but the importance of it cannot go unnoticed when it comes to a marvelous work and a wonder. President Ezra Taft Benson stated:</p>
<p><i>The time is long overdue for a massive ­flooding of the earth with the Book of Mormon for the many reasons which the Lord has given. In this age of ­electronic media and mass distribution of the printed word, God will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a ­monumental way.</i></p>
<p><i>We have the Book of Mormon, we have the members, we have the missionaries, we have the resources, and the world has the need. The time is now! . . .</i></p>
<p><i>I have a vision of homes alerted, of classes alive, and of pulpits aflame with the spirit of Book of Mormon messages.</i></p>
<p><i>I have a vision of home teachers and visiting teachers, ward and branch officers, and stake and mission leaders counseling our people out of the most correct of any book on earth—the Book of Mormon.</i></p>
<p><i>I have a vision of artists putting into film, drama, literature, music, and paintings great themes and great characters from the Book of Mormon.</i></p>
<p><i>I have a vision of thousands of missionaries going into the mission field with hundreds of passages memorized from the Book of Mormon so that they might feed the needs of a spiritually famished world.</i></p>
<p><i>I have a vision of the whole Church getting nearer to God by abiding by the precepts of the Book of Mormon.</i></p>
<p><i>Indeed, I have a vision of flooding the earth with the Book of Mormon. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>I do not know fully why God has preserved my life to this age, but I do know this: That for the present hour He has revealed to me the absolute need for us to move the Book of Mormon forward now in a marvelous manner. You must help with this burden and with this blessing which He has placed on the whole Church, even all the children of Zion.</i></p>
<p><i>Moses never entered the promised land. Joseph Smith never saw Zion redeemed. Some of us may not live long enough to see the day when the Book of Mormon floods the earth and when the Lord lifts His condemnation. (See D&amp;C 84:54–58.) But, God willing, I intend to spend all my remaining days in that glorious effort.</i> [“Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, November 1988, 4–6]</p>
<h2><b>3. Magnify the Work—Self-Salvation</b></h2>
<p>The third M&amp;M is <b>magnify.</b> In Doctrine and Covenants 4:4 we read:</p>
<p><i>For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul.</i></p>
<p>The gospel is as true today as it was in 1829, when this section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given. A mission is not a saving ordinance, but it does bring salvation to the soul. I have been home from my mission for forty-one years now, and a day has not gone by that I have not been blessed because of my mission. The mission only lasted two years, but forty years later it has not dimmed with time. If it only brought salvation to one soul—mine—it was worth it.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 84 shares some insights into what we can expect as blessings from the Lord start to flow into our lives:</p>
<p><i>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</i></p>
<p><i>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</i></p>
<p><i>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</i></p>
<p><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i></p>
<p><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i></p>
<p><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i> [D&amp;C 84:33–38]</p>
<p>All the Father hath—what more is there?</p>
<p>Again from Doctrine and Covenants 4, in verse 2, we read:</p>
<p><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i></p>
<p>If you serve God with “all your heart, might, mind and strength,” you can stand before God blameless at the last day. Let me submit to you that the last day can be the last day of your mission or the last day of any calling you might receive. That great and last day is going to be glorious if, on the last day of every calling, you have served the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I remember coming home off my mission and thinking I had served with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. Now I wasn’t the shiniest candy in the bowl during my mission, but I did the best I could, and I have tried to do the same thing with every calling I have received since.</p>
<h2><b>4. Money Management</b></h2>
<p>The final M&amp;M is for <b>money management.</b> It is not the most critical factor in determining a mission, but it can define and definitely be mind consuming. Any young person who comes with the desire to serve a mission can definitely find funding. But don’t take it for granted. I think the Lord expects us to do all we can to prepare financially and not leave it up to someone else.</p>
<p>When I started working for Snow College in 1983, we had taken a big cut in pay to move home. We about starved that first year, but we came up with a plan for saving for our kids’ missions. Our first two children were girls, and then the next five were boys. We always planned on the boys going on missions, so we saved a little bit each month for their missions, and we also had a plan to have our home paid off by the time they started to serve.</p>
<p>When my second daughter said she would like to serve a mission, it was at the same time my oldest son was getting ready for his mission. They both received their mission calls the same day. My daughter entered the MTC two weeks before my son, and they were in the MTC at the same time. Daina went to Mexico City and Phillip went to Kiev, Ukraine. We had the money for Phillip, but we didn’t have a dime for Daina.</p>
<p>From the week before Daina entered the MTC to her last week in the mission field, we did not pay a full mission payment for her. It was amazing. People would come up to us and say, “You need this more than I do,” and a couple of businesses in Mount Pleasant paid a full mission payment four or five times. Even my parents stepped up. Daina’s mission was completely paid for this way.</p>
<p>When Daina got home I thought we were going to get rich off these missions. Not one more dime ever came in, but what a blessing those donations were. I can’t help but feel it was because we had planned and saved for many years, and the Lord did the rest of what we couldn’t do.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Missionary work is exactly what it is: hard, scary, consuming, exciting, fulfilling, and many other words.</p>
<p>However, just like the candy M&amp;M’s come in so many colors but all taste the same, missionary work looks different for every person but all leads to the same thing—bringing souls unto Christ. You can come up with your own M&amp;M’s, and I’m sure there are a lot more <i>M </i>words out there that can represent ­missionary-minded members. It still all comes down to the work of the Savior.</p>
<p><b>M</b>iraculous conversion—just a simple prayer.</p>
<p><b>M</b>arvelous work and a wonder—the Book of Mormon, such a great cause.</p>
<p><b>M</b>agnify—all the Father has.</p>
<p><b>M</b>oney management—knowing whose work this really is.</p>
<p>I know God lives. This is His great plan of happiness that the world needs. I know that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The fruits are before you. I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the prophet today and that this is the Savior’s kingdom upon the earth with an eternal mission to accomplish.</p>
<p>Now that I am getting closer to going on a mission again, I find that my wife and I are challenged with the same issues and the same concerns about a mission that I had when I was seventeen years old. But now I know. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

While it is not possible for me to shake hands with each of you and look you in the eye personally, I want you to know that you are precious in the sight of your Heavenly Father. He loves you. The leaders of the Church love you.
I also want you to know that you have an exciting and meaningful service to the Lord ahead of you. I recognize that years of sacrifice by your parents, as well as by each of you, have helped you become who you are. Today I look at you and recognize your own years of commitment to the Church and to nourishing your own testimonies through study and application of gospel principles. I look at you and see the future of the Church—not just the future bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and auxiliary leaders but the great ranks of future mothers and fathers, Primary and Sunday School teachers, youth leaders, home teachers, visiting teachers, Scout leaders, choir directors, and countless others who will serve the Lord in the 21st century.
It will be a different century than the one that has just passed. In some ways it will be better; in other ways it will be much more difficult for you and for your children. But one thing is inescapable: it will be your century—one in which you have the opportunity to leave your mark for good or otherwise. You will try to influence others, and others will try to influence you. Either you will share and promote your core values, rooted in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, or you will allow others to define your values for you and your posterity.
Communication in the future will continue to change through Internet and new media technologies. Your world of cyberspace—cell phones that capture video downloads, iTunes, social networks like Facebook, text messaging, blogs, Twitter, handhelds, and podcasts—is just the beginning of what is yet ahead for you in the remarkable expansion of technology. It makes me wish I had been born 20 years later so that I could figure out how to run my iPhone when it doesn’t behave, which is quite often.
We are in a titanic struggle, my young brothers and sisters. From the dawn of mankind’s history it has always been so. Good and evil have always been with us, and so has the right to choose between them. For the time I have with you today, I want to share some thoughts about standing firm for the truth.
Recently I saw some research about how other people see members of the Church. I have long been interested in this subject because I have had somewhat to do with missionary work in my Church assignments. Knowing how people see us is an important part of understanding how best to explain ourselves. This particular piece of research made an interesting observation. It suggested that members of our Church can sometimes appear very defensive to those who are not members of the Church. One respondent went so far as to say that when Mormons are</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I consider it a great privilege and responsibility to be given this opportunity to speak to you. After I received this assignment from the First Presidency, I asked President Samuelson what I should talk about.
He said, “You are the executive director of the Missionary Department. Why don’t you talk about missionary work?”
I have decided to follow his counsel.
You are a magnificent sight! Many of you are recently returned from full-time missions. Many of you will soon be full-time missionaries. I hope all of you are committed to being lifelong missionaries.
Some feel this is a difficult time to do missionary work. A Gallup Poll three weeks ago found 46 percent of Americans view “Mormons” unfavorably, 11 percent don’t know who we are, and 18 percent think of polygamy when our name is mentioned.1
Let’s put this in perspective. In 1842 John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, wrote to Joseph Smith requesting information about the Church. The Church had been organized 12 years earlier and had just over 20,000 members. The Prophet Joseph replied and concluded his response by using the Standard of Truth as a preface to what we know today as the Thirteen Articles of Faith.
As I tour missions, many missionaries memorize the Standard of Truth. It conveys in a concise way what must be accomplished. As I recite it, I invite those of you who know it to say it with me:
No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.2
Who is going to help achieve this? You and your generation!
I believe with all of my heart that we are on the threshold of the most significant missionary success to date. Let me share two accounts of those who have been converted in the recent past.
The conversion of Jordan Vajda, a fine young man who had been a Catholic priest, is instructive. When he was in grade school he had Latter-day Saint friends in his class who shared with him their love of the gospel. At age 13 he found an offer from the Church for a free Book of Mormon. He sent for it, and two sister missionaries responded. They were surprised that he was only 13 and had requested the Book of Mormon. He was impressed with what they taught and what he felt, but after discussions with his family, he decided to become a priest in the Catholic Church. As he prepared to be a priest, he remained interested in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
He studied at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. He became acquainted with many who take the position we are not Christians, </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During the observance of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Church members have been reminded of the breadth and depth of his influence as the priesthood leader of this dispensation. Our knowledge has been renewed of the miracles associated with the coming forth and spreading of the gospel, the growth of the Church, and the continuing role of modern-day prophets who lead the Church in latter-day preparation to greet the Savior in a coming day as He ushers in the millennial era. We expect the Prophet Joseph to be with Him when He comes!
How do we prepare to meet the Savior? As we follow the Prophet, every faithful member of the Church must understand and accept a personal commitment to support the work of carrying the message of the restored gospel to the world. The life of each Church member will continue to be directly affected by missionary responsibility. We or our families will have been brought into the Church by missionaries, be now preparing for a mission, have already served at least one mission, or be supporting and sustaining others in fulfilling their calls. Knowledge about how the work is unfolding across the world will strengthen our faith and our desire to fulfill our personal missionary responsibilities.
I pray for the sustaining influence of the Holy Spirit as I offer thoughts about the Prophet Joseph and the coming forth of the Church on the African continent. The dedication of the Accra Ghana Temple in January of 2004 and of the Aba Nigeria Temple one month ago have been acknowledged by President Hinckley as truly miraculous in many ways, and these dedications constitute important parts of the fulfillment of the 1839 prophecy to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail, when he was told, “The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name” (D&amp;C 122:1).1
Africa remains substantially unknown to most of the world. Although it occupies nearly 20 percent of the earth’s surface and its population is almost 15 percent of the world’s total, there are still relatively few who have visited the continent or found reason to inform themselves about it.
For those who have been there, simply hearing the word Africa is exhilarating. It arouses an unending panorama of images and emotions for those who have visited the broad plains, the wondrous natural sights, the small villages, and the teeming cities or who have met any of the vast variety of heartwarming, disarmingly positive, and resourceful African people. A spiritual dimension is evidenced in the lives of so many of them, and they are warmly open and responsive to any sincere expression of friendship. It is primarily the African people who inspire such positive reactions and loyalties from foreign observers, but natural and physical Africa does as well.
Physically, Africa is vast, enormously complicated, and not easily described. It is a huge landmass of deserts, rain forests, boundless plains, wild animal</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Groberg: My dear brothers and sisters, we are happy to be here. Jean and I met at BYU in 1952 on a blind date arranged by our sisters, who played violins together in the BYU Symphony. It was the first date for either of us at BYU. Since Jean was from California and I was from Idaho, how grateful do you think we are for BYU? Five years later we were married in the Los Angeles Temple. Those were five exciting, frustrating, trial-ridden years—but we knew what was right, and, despite serious challenges, things worked out, as they always do with the Lord’s help. We loved one another then, and now—49 years, 11 children, and 33 grandchildren later—we love each other more than ever. Joy comes from true love. This joy is available to everyone if they will just follow these three simple steps:
1. Learn the truth.
2. Promise to live the truth.
3. Live the truth and trust the Lord that when you have done all you can, He will come to your rescue.
Love is largely an eternal commitment to think of and help someone else—especially a wife or husband or child—more than yourself. If we keep helping others regardless of their reciprocation, our soul keeps expanding, and eventually we can become like unto God, helping others with no limits.
To me the opposite of love is not hate but selfishness, or indifference. Selfishness shrivels the soul. Constantly thinking of and protecting ourselves causes us to become smaller. If we persist in this, we eventually shrink down to practically nothing.
A good sign of how truly we love someone is how anxiously we help them—even at the expense of our own convenience.
The truest love of all is the Savior’s love and God’s love for us. Think of the Savior’s commitment to suffer for us and even to lay down His life for us, despite the almost total lack of appreciation of those around Him at the time.
What others do to us is almost incidental. The eternal principle of growth through true love—by helping others—lies within each one of us. And when this true love lies within both husband and wife, we can literally experience heaven on earth. I hope you all experience that! I love the Lord, I love my wife, I love my family, I love BYU, and I love all of you.
Again, the pattern for growth and joy in this life is:
1. Learn the truth—know what is right.
2. Promise, or commit, to live the truth.
3. Keep that promise, no matter what trials may come, by trusting the Lord to help you. I promise He will!
The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Him means to trust Him. We must trust that what He tells us—through the scriptures, through prayer, through inspired teachers, through good leaders and parents—is right. Trust that He will help us keep our promises by making up the difference when we have done all we can. I personally know He will.
