  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="As a brand-new missionary in England, I was assigned to the southern coast for my first area. One Sunday afternoon my companion  and I decided to go tracting in the small town of Sandwich, located just a few miles north of the white cliffs of Dover. After a few hours of  knocking on doors, feeling like we must have talked to every living person in the place—and without any success at all—we sat down dejectedly on  a nearby bench.

Although it was summertime, it was a rather cold and damp day, as sometimes happens in England. Feeling downcast due to  the lack of response to our efforts to share the gospel, my companion tried to lighten the mood by remarking, “It’s okay, Elder. It could be  worse: it could be one degree colder right now.”

His comment was well received and hit home. Life really wasn’t bad. We were in a  beautiful country. We had the gospel. We were missionaries on the Lord’s errand. In fact, I had more blessings than problems. I felt much better  knocking on doors the rest of the afternoon, armed with an enlightened attitude and a purer perspective—although I was still cold and damp and I  still wished someone would listen.

As insightful and perceptive as was my companion’s point—that “it could be worse: it could be one  degree colder”—what happens when it does get one degree colder? Or, for that matter, what happens when, metaphorically speaking, it gets ten or  even fifty degrees colder? What happens when the pressure is on, the crowd is watching, and the game is on the line?

In a college  environment, what do you do when the homework is grueling, the exams are punishing, the roommates are exasperating, and the longed-for eternal  companion is not materializing? Or, after college, what do you do if you don’t land a job, you get laid off, you have stress in your marriage,  you have poor health, or your teenagers don’t listen? In those times of trial, despair, fear, and worry, the stage is best set for God to show  forth His power. Indeed, it is often in the most dire of circumstances that God’s arm is revealed most miraculously.

Miracles require  faith and generally some amount of courage and hope on our part as well as trust that God will always do His part. We must also remember that  God’s ways are not our ways. His response to a given situation might be different than what we want to have happen. In addition, the timing of  His response could vary greatly from our expected timing. Yet in all cases, God’s involvement in our lives is carefully crafted to bring about  the greatest good. For “he doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find Courage and  Hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Several years ago I gave a lesson in my elders quorum based on the July 2004 First Presidency message written by President Thomas  S. Monson and titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/07/miracles-of-faith?lang=eng&amp;amp;_r=1&quot;&gt;Miracles of Faith&lt;/a&gt;.” One part of the lesson particularly struck me because of the uniqueness of a principle that I had not  previously considered—a principle that afterward became even more personally poignant because of imminent events that were to occur in our  home.

From time to time the Lord puts certain truths into our hearts that affect our future destiny. We may not fully understand His  reason for teaching us these principles at these particular times. Instead, it is often once we have passed through the ensuing experiences that  clarity comes. We can then look back through life’s lenses and more fully see that God does prepare a way for us to accomplish what He  commands.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Part of President Monson’s message that I shared with my elders quorum read:

&lt;i&gt;Mothers and fathers  who anxiously await the arrival of a precious child sometimes learn that all is not well with this tiny infant. A missing limb, sightless eyes,  a damaged brain . . . greets the parents, leaving them baffled, filled with sorrow, and reaching out for hope.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;There follows  the inevitable blaming of oneself, the condemnation of a careless action, and the perennial questions: “Why such a tragedy in our family?” . . .  “How did this happen?” “Where was God?” “Where was a protecting angel?” &lt;/i&gt;If, why, where, how—&lt;i&gt;those recurring words—do not bring back the  lost son, the perfect body, the plans of parents, or the dreams of youth. Self-pity, personal withdrawal, or deep despair will not bring the  peace, the assurance, or help which are needed. Rather, we must go forward, look upward, move onward, and rise heavenward.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It  is imperative that we recognize that whatever has happened to us has happened to others. They have coped and so must we. We are not alone.  Heavenly Father’s help is near.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

What struck me was that “the absence of the miracle” could actually be a  miracle in and of itself—the premise being that as God’s ways and thoughts are higher than man’s, at times the Lord may choose to provide a  miracle counterintuitive to what we may want, knowing full well His own end purpose. Because of the absence of the miracle fixed in our minds,  He is better able to help us grow and thus become happier than we ever could have been had we received the desired miracle for which we had  prayed.

At the time I initially read this First Presidency message, I naively thought my impression of that principle was because I had  given a blessing to the daughter of a family I home taught, hoping that a dramatic recovery would spark the family back into activity. When the  little girl ended up in the hospital that same day, I thought the absence of the miracle would somehow bless their lives more than if she had  been miraculously healed. However, little did I suspect the extraordinary experience among the challenges that the Lord was already  engineering.

About a month later my expectant wife, April, and I went to an ultrasound appointment to see whether we were having a boy  or a girl. We learned that we were having our third son. We also learned that there were severe physical complications afflicting his body. He  was missing large portions of his brain, his skull wasn’t properly shaped, and the doctors weren’t even sure if he would survive till delivery.  During the ensuing weeks it seemed that every time we received additional information it was bad news. I still remember sitting in a room in the  Brewster Building, across the street from the Wilkinson Center, when my wife called to tell me the latest update: Our son didn’t have a right  eye. Thinking back to what my mission companion had said, I certainly felt like things were much worse than one degree colder.

With  faith, and in order to pray more specifically and effectively for our unborn son, we decided on his name early. Previously we had waited until  we actually saw our children to make sure they matched their names. We chose the name Caleb, after the Old Testament Israelite who was a  companion to Moses and Joshua and who was noted for his “fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Caleb survived  his birth, though it became quickly apparent that he would be very much like a newborn throughout his entire life. He would never walk. He would  never talk. He would never feed himself or be able to so much as hold his head up on his own. When we asked how long we might expect him to  live, the doctor replied, “Take him home and never bring him back to the hospital. We can’t do anything for him. He has a few weeks to a few  months—outside chance of a year, possibly two.”

I remember being terrified as we walked out of the hospital with our little boy to  take him home. The number of machines and medical equipment we needed to sustain his life was overwhelming. The possibility of losing him was a  constant fear. Simply feeding him required extraordinary effort because he needed to eat every three hours. The process to eat took one hour to  complete. This involved waking up throughout the night: start the pump, sleep for an hour, stop the pump, sleep for two hours, start the pump,  sleep for an hour, and so on. We wondered how we would keep ourselves alive, let alone our fragile son.

Thankfully, the Lord blessed  us with many miracles in what seemed like a hopeless situation. Angels in the form of ward members, family members, friends, and medical  personnel came to our aid. We literally had meals brought in for three months. We had a competent and caring nurse, a doctor who made house  calls, and family and neighbors who prayed mightily on our behalf. We could feel heaven’s hand upon us. I felt angels walked our hallways and  sat in Caleb’s room. Our three-year-old son told us that sometimes he saw Jesus peeking in our windows.

In Caleb’s baby blessing I  promised him that he had completed his task on earth by being born and that he could now rest for a time. But this was not the plan for Caleb  and his mother. In some kind of pact with heaven that I have yet to fully understand, Caleb and April bargained with heaven to do a greater  work. God had matched them up perfectly—Caleb with his fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds and April with her mother’s love and daring  optimism.

April purposefully chose hope and trust in the Lord. To her core she is happy and optimistic. With God’s help she took what  could have been a terrifying trial and reshaped it. She took a corner of heaven and pulled it right down into our home, opening it up for all to  enjoy. Every day became a celebration with Caleb. She made him a birthday cake after his first week, cupcakes for his second week, cookies for  his third week, and so on. She celebrated everything about Caleb, for every day was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the boy who was  sent home without hope.

In what might have looked like a burdensome task to others, caring for Caleb became a privilege. Though his  body was misshapen and broken, his spirit was whole, noble, and great.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Being in his presence was healing and heavenly. I love my  wife and thank her, Caleb, and Heavenly Father for making the time with Caleb not only possible but powerful. It was indeed heaven on  earth.

Even his missing eye was a blessing. It became his distinctive feature. People were drawn to him, especially children. They  would often ask, “Where is his eye? What happened to him?”

I would usually say that Caleb was a pirate or that a bear had eaten his  eye. But my wife would explain that in our family, a wink meant “I love you.”

Before Caleb was born, we told our boys that he would  only have one of his eyes. They were concerned for their brother.

“Don’t worry,” April would say. “He will just wink at us every  day!”

Caleb was never able to tell us he loved us with words, but he told us every day with his wink. His little wink was a daily  message of love from heaven. He brought the love of God and the Light of Christ into the lives of all who knew him. His winking eye was a sweet  reminder of his deep love for all of us.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

Hope and courage have always characterized the righteous. Ever the optimist,  Joseph Smith was once quoted as saying:

&lt;i&gt;I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties should surround me, if I was sunk  in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged but hang on, exercise faith and  keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

It was this type of faithful fortitude that  saved the Nephites from the decree of death declared by the unbelievers if the sign of Christ’s birth did not come. It came the very night that  Nephi prayed.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, a measure of firm faith and trust in God preceded the parting of the Red Sea;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; saved Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abed-nego from a fiery furnace;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and helped David defeat a giant.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognize God’s Ways Are  Higher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
However, not all miracles deliver. Sometimes, according to God’s purposes, miracles are seemingly withheld in order for His  greater designs to develop. After all, Abinadi was burned at the stake, the Mormons were driven out of Jackson County, and Joseph Smith was  martyred at Carthage Jail. On a less important scale, but still significant to those involved, lost puppies may not be found, testing center  prayers may not be immediately answered, and Church basketball games may not be played with good sportsmanship in spite of prayers offered  otherwise.

But that doesn’t mean God is absent or doesn’t care or hasn’t provided a miracle. Again, it is during those times when it  is ten degrees colder that God is involved, He does care, and He is performing His work. We must remember that “as the heavens are higher than  the earth, so are [His] ways higher than [our] ways, and [His] thoughts than [our] thoughts.”&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;

Just imagine what would  happen if miracles were left up to us. In my arena of athletics, it would probably go something like this: The Church is true. The Church is the  sponsoring organization of BYU, the Lord’s university. The BYU sports teams are flagships of the university. Therefore, no BYU team should ever  lose, which would be irrefutable evidence that the Church is true. What a blessing this would be to the growth of the Church. I can picture the  missionaries talking to an investigator: “Brother Jones, as you know, the BYU football team has never lost, the basketball team has won every  national title, and each of our golfers gets a hole in one on every swing. Don’t you think it’s about time you were  baptized?”

Obviously the Lord does not work this way. A plan in which supposedly everything would go right so nobody would be lost was  already proposed and rejected. The plan of salvation, on the other hand, allows for opposition in all things: sadness and sweetness, wrongdoing  and repentance, trial and testimony.

With so much opposition in our lives at times, it seems like God chooses to work through  underdogs. Take Gideon of the Old Testament, for example. Israel was in bondage to the Midianites. God called Gideon to deliver them, and Gideon  raised an army of 32,000 men.

&lt;i&gt;And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the  Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;

God  asked Gideon to reduce his army to 10,000, which was still too many. God then asked him to reduce his force even further to just 300 men to go  against a foe who were “like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for  multitude.”&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; With the help of God and against all odds, Gideon and those 300 men bested the Midianites and their tens of  thousands.

God is clearly not limited by the same constraints that obstruct our mortal way. Left on their own, Gideon and his 300  would have had little chance for victory. But Gideon was not alone, nor is he the only instance of God using small and simple “means to bring  about his great and eternal purposes.”&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; God took Enoch, a lad slow of speech, and walked with him.

&lt;i&gt;And so great  was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God . . . ; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled,  even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course . . . ; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was  the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;

God also took former  Egyptian slaves and molded them into the mighty Israelite nation. He turned a fisherman into a chief apostle. And He shaped a plowboy into a  prophet.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; The Lord Himself came to earth in the most humble of circumstances—as a babe in a manger who was born into a carpenter’s  family and who became Lord of lords, King of kings,&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; and Savior of worlds without end.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trust God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Such miraculous  transformations come as a result of trusting in God’s plan. One night for family scripture study we read the account of the “man which was blind  from his birth.”&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; The “disciples asked [Christ], saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born  blind?”&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;

Seeing the obvious parallel in our own home, our young sons asked why Caleb was born blind. In the next verse the  Lord provided our response: “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in  him.”&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Then Jesus healed the man so that he could see.

Caught up in the grandeur of the story, our boys asked if I could  heal Caleb. I stammered some kind of response that I didn’t feel it was the Lord’s will for Caleb to be healed. I added that often the healings  recorded in the scriptures were performed by Jesus, prophets, or apostles—very righteous men commissioned by God to perform miracles for  specific purposes of blessing the lives of those involved and increasing the faith of those who would eventually read these  stories.

Not to be put off, and possibly sensing my apprehensive response, my boys faithfully concluded that it was time to appeal to  a higher authority. It so happened that we were going to the Church Administration Building later that week to attend the setting apart of my  dad as a mission president by one of the Brethren. Knowing that we would be meeting an apostle, my sons requested that I ask him to heal  Caleb.

Talk about being put between a rock and a hard place. How could I sustain their faith without selfishly imposing on an apostle?  I compromised with my boys by telling them that I would not ask for a blessing on Caleb but that we would leave it in the hands of the  Lord.

It was a wonderful occasion to be with my dad as he was set apart and to be in the presence of one of the Lord’s special  witnesses. He was not inspired to heal Caleb. But as we walked out of his office, he stopped at Caleb’s stroller, bent down, and kissed him. He  told him three times that he loved him. He then shook my hand and hugged my wife while whispering in her ear, “I am so proud of you.” In the  sight of God, Caleb did not need healing. Instead, it was I who left that office peacefully whole.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rely on His Timing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Trusting  in God means that we also trust in His timing. The man in the New Testament story was blind from birth. I’m not sure how old he was, but he had  waited years for that miracle. Then one day the Master came along and healed him. “In his own time, and in his own way,”&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; God will  respond.

As an example of the Lord’s timing in my life, I had been at my new job in the BYU Athletic Department for about three weeks  when I had to go down to Las Vegas for a business meeting as part of the conference basketball tournament. I woke up very early to make the long  drive in time for my meeting at noon. My wife and I prayed fervently that I would make it safely. Caleb had been in the hospital for a few  weeks, and we had been up many late nights to be with him. Despite every precaution and physical effort I could make, just outside of St. George  I fell asleep in the blink of an eye while driving full speed down the freeway.

I woke up to find myself heading down a hill into the  median dividing the highway—one set of tires on the pavement, the other set in the weeds and gravel. I quickly spun the wheel to take me back on  the road, but this only caused me to do a 180-degree turn across the lanes of traffic. Thankfully no other cars were near me. Once I got to the  far right side of the road, I had the fleeting thought that I could pull it off and would be able to stop the car on the right shoulder. Not so.  I think the car was still traveling about 60 to 70 miles per hour when I slammed into the sand and sagebrush, flipping the car  over.

Eventually the car came to an abrupt stop with me hanging upside down by my seat belt. I undid the catch and fell to the  floor—which had been the roof of the car. It was impossible to open any of the car doors. They were all wedged shut because the car had become  fairly flattened to the ground. I climbed through a window, since all the glass in the vehicle had shattered.

Besides a bruised and  embarrassed ego, I was completely unharmed. The only cut I had was a small slice on my hand where a piece of glass had stuck me when I released  myself from the seat belt and fell to the ground. After being checked out by the police (who also issued me a ticket), my sweet grandmother who  lived in St. George somehow let me borrow her car so I could finish my trip to Las Vegas. I walked into my meeting about fifteen minutes  late.

The hard part was telling my boss, Tom Holmoe—who was also at the basketball tournament—that I had destroyed a university  vehicle during my first month on the job. To make a bad situation worse, my seat at the basketball game following the meeting happened to be  directly in front of President Samuelson. I spent the game pulling glass out of my hair as inconspicuously as possible.

In my mind the  timing of that wreck was life turning one degree colder. I was trying to make a good first impression at my job. My wife and I were doing our  best to take care of a sick child. We had prayed for safety.

The Lord’s timing and purpose were made clear over the following days and  months. Tom is a great boss and has never held the accident and the loss of the car against me. The university eventually replaced the car but  thankfully didn’t have to replace me—because I was still alive. The Lord had preserved me from what should have been a fatal accident. Having  come so close to death helped me more fully appreciate my life and the people around me. I especially enjoyed the time spent with Caleb late at  night when I would wake up to take care of him. Not only did it mean I was still alive, but Caleb was too.

There were times when I  thought Caleb would live a long time. He had so often successfully battled sicknesses and surgeries, illnesses and infections. He had been to  the hospital many times but always came back to us. We loved having him in our home. “Caleb could have quickly returned to heaven but, instead,  he brought heaven to us for seven years.”&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;

Twenty-five days ago, in the timing of the Lord, Caleb slipped peacefully away  while being held in the arms of his mother and surrounded by his family. He had spent a courageous day fighting with his might against a vicious  infection brought on by pneumonia. The wonderful doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel at Primary Children’s Medical Center had done all  they professionally could to keep Caleb alive. His body was simply too worn out.

I have heroes in my life: Joseph Smith, Captain  Moroni, Ammon, and others. On that day, my wife was my hero. As she bravely and tenderly leaned down to hug Caleb, she whispered in his ear, “I  love you, Caleb. I am so proud of you. If your body is too tired, it’s okay. You can go back. You can return to Heavenly Father.”

For  over seven years her love and God’s will allowed Caleb to be a significant part of our earthly experience. But in the very moment when it was  needed, her heart changed. She could let him go. She trusted God because she knew God. She knew that God understood her personally, in a way  that few others could, for God had also lost a son. And through the Atonement of that Son, God can do miracles. He can forgive a sinner. He can  save a lost soul. He can heal a broken heart.

“With God nothing [is] impossible,”&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; especially when life is hard and it is  ten degrees colder outside. “But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.”&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; God provides the  plan and we contribute the faith and courage. We trust in His timing and in His ways to achieve His purposes, even when—and probably  &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when—such purposes may be unclear from our perspective.

At a stake conference not too long ago, I had an interview  with a visiting General Authority. He learned about Caleb as part of our discussion. After he acknowledged the hard work it took to care for  Caleb, I thought he would then encourage me to keep it up and to faithfully persevere in the service and sacrifice I was providing. Instead, his  next four words entirely transformed my relationship with Caleb. He simply said, “You are being exalted.”

All this time I had thought  that we were taking care of Caleb. But in reality, God, through Caleb, had been taking care of us. God was making a miracle where I hadn’t  expected one. He was performing a miracle on me, on my wife, on our kids, and on all those who came in contact with Caleb. Having Caleb in our  home was an honor and a privilege. It was also a sacred experience.

Through our faith, courage, hope, and trust, God will bless us—no  matter how cold our lives may feel. I know that God loves us. I know that He hears us and heals us. And I know that He is exalting us. In the  name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>As a brand-new missionary in England, I was assigned to the southern coast for my first area. One Sunday afternoon my companion  and I decided to go tracting in the small town of Sandwich, located just a few miles north of the white cliffs of Dover. After a few hours of  knocking on doors, feeling like we must have talked to every living person in the place—and without any success at all—we sat down dejectedly on  a nearby bench.</p>
<p>Although it was summertime, it was a rather cold and damp day, as sometimes happens in England. Feeling downcast due to  the lack of response to our efforts to share the gospel, my companion tried to lighten the mood by remarking, “It’s okay, Elder. It could be  worse: it could be one degree colder right now.”</p>
<p>His comment was well received and hit home. Life really wasn’t bad. We were in a  beautiful country. We had the gospel. We were missionaries on the Lord’s errand. In fact, I had more blessings than problems. I felt much better  knocking on doors the rest of the afternoon, armed with an enlightened attitude and a purer perspective—although I was still cold and damp and I  still wished someone would listen.</p>
<p>As insightful and perceptive as was my companion’s point—that “it could be worse: it could be one  degree colder”—what happens when it does get one degree colder? Or, for that matter, what happens when, metaphorically speaking, it gets ten or  even fifty degrees colder? What happens when the pressure is on, the crowd is watching, and the game is on the line?</p>
<p>In a college  environment, what do you do when the homework is grueling, the exams are punishing, the roommates are exasperating, and the longed-for eternal  companion is not materializing? Or, after college, what do you do if you don’t land a job, you get laid off, you have stress in your marriage,  you have poor health, or your teenagers don’t listen? In those times of trial, despair, fear, and worry, the stage is best set for God to show  forth His power. Indeed, it is often in the most dire of circumstances that God’s arm is revealed most miraculously.</p>
<p>Miracles require  faith and generally some amount of courage and hope on our part as well as trust that God will always do His part. We must also remember that  God’s ways are not our ways. His response to a given situation might be different than what we want to have happen. In addition, the timing of  His response could vary greatly from our expected timing. Yet in all cases, God’s involvement in our lives is carefully crafted to bring about  the greatest good. For “he doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<h2><b>Find Courage and  Hope</b></h2>
<p>Several years ago I gave a lesson in my elders quorum based on the July 2004 First Presidency message written by President Thomas  S. Monson and titled “<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/07/miracles-of-faith?lang=eng&amp;_r=1">Miracles of Faith</a>.” One part of the lesson particularly struck me because of the uniqueness of a principle that I had not  previously considered—a principle that afterward became even more personally poignant because of imminent events that were to occur in our  home.</p>
<p>From time to time the Lord puts certain truths into our hearts that affect our future destiny. We may not fully understand His  reason for teaching us these principles at these particular times. Instead, it is often once we have passed through the ensuing experiences that  clarity comes. We can then look back through life’s lenses and more fully see that God does prepare a way for us to accomplish what He  commands.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Part of President Monson’s message that I shared with my elders quorum read:</p>
<p><i>Mothers and fathers  who anxiously await the arrival of a precious child sometimes learn that all is not well with this tiny infant. A missing limb, sightless eyes,  a damaged brain . . . greets the parents, leaving them baffled, filled with sorrow, and reaching out for hope.</i></p>
<p><i>There follows  the inevitable blaming of oneself, the condemnation of a careless action, and the perennial questions: “Why such a tragedy in our family?” . . .  “How did this happen?” “Where was God?” “Where was a protecting angel?” </i>If, why, where, how—<i>those recurring words—do not bring back the  lost son, the perfect body, the plans of parents, or the dreams of youth. Self-pity, personal withdrawal, or deep despair will not bring the  peace, the assurance, or help which are needed. Rather, we must go forward, look upward, move onward, and rise heavenward.</i></p>
<p><i>It  is imperative that we recognize that whatever has happened to us has happened to others. They have coped and so must we. We are not alone.  Heavenly Father’s help is near.</i><sup>3</sup></p>
<p>What struck me was that “the absence of the miracle” could actually be a  miracle in and of itself—the premise being that as God’s ways and thoughts are higher than man’s, at times the Lord may choose to provide a  miracle counterintuitive to what we may want, knowing full well His own end purpose. Because of the absence of the miracle fixed in our minds,  He is better able to help us grow and thus become happier than we ever could have been had we received the desired miracle for which we had  prayed.</p>
<p>At the time I initially read this First Presidency message, I naively thought my impression of that principle was because I had  given a blessing to the daughter of a family I home taught, hoping that a dramatic recovery would spark the family back into activity. When the  little girl ended up in the hospital that same day, I thought the absence of the miracle would somehow bless their lives more than if she had  been miraculously healed. However, little did I suspect the extraordinary experience among the challenges that the Lord was already  engineering.</p>
<p>About a month later my expectant wife, April, and I went to an ultrasound appointment to see whether we were having a boy  or a girl. We learned that we were having our third son. We also learned that there were severe physical complications afflicting his body. He  was missing large portions of his brain, his skull wasn’t properly shaped, and the doctors weren’t even sure if he would survive till delivery.  During the ensuing weeks it seemed that every time we received additional information it was bad news. I still remember sitting in a room in the  Brewster Building, across the street from the Wilkinson Center, when my wife called to tell me the latest update: Our son didn’t have a right  eye. Thinking back to what my mission companion had said, I certainly felt like things were much worse than one degree colder.</p>
<p>With  faith, and in order to pray more specifically and effectively for our unborn son, we decided on his name early. Previously we had waited until  we actually saw our children to make sure they matched their names. We chose the name Caleb, after the Old Testament Israelite who was a  companion to Moses and Joshua and who was noted for his “fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.”<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Caleb survived  his birth, though it became quickly apparent that he would be very much like a newborn throughout his entire life. He would never walk. He would  never talk. He would never feed himself or be able to so much as hold his head up on his own. When we asked how long we might expect him to  live, the doctor replied, “Take him home and never bring him back to the hospital. We can’t do anything for him. He has a few weeks to a few  months—outside chance of a year, possibly two.”</p>
<p>I remember being terrified as we walked out of the hospital with our little boy to  take him home. The number of machines and medical equipment we needed to sustain his life was overwhelming. The possibility of losing him was a  constant fear. Simply feeding him required extraordinary effort because he needed to eat every three hours. The process to eat took one hour to  complete. This involved waking up throughout the night: start the pump, sleep for an hour, stop the pump, sleep for two hours, start the pump,  sleep for an hour, and so on. We wondered how we would keep ourselves alive, let alone our fragile son.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Lord blessed  us with many miracles in what seemed like a hopeless situation. Angels in the form of ward members, family members, friends, and medical  personnel came to our aid. We literally had meals brought in for three months. We had a competent and caring nurse, a doctor who made house  calls, and family and neighbors who prayed mightily on our behalf. We could feel heaven’s hand upon us. I felt angels walked our hallways and  sat in Caleb’s room. Our three-year-old son told us that sometimes he saw Jesus peeking in our windows.</p>
<p>In Caleb’s baby blessing I  promised him that he had completed his task on earth by being born and that he could now rest for a time. But this was not the plan for Caleb  and his mother. In some kind of pact with heaven that I have yet to fully understand, Caleb and April bargained with heaven to do a greater  work. God had matched them up perfectly—Caleb with his fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds and April with her mother’s love and daring  optimism.</p>
<p>April purposefully chose hope and trust in the Lord. To her core she is happy and optimistic. With God’s help she took what  could have been a terrifying trial and reshaped it. She took a corner of heaven and pulled it right down into our home, opening it up for all to  enjoy. Every day became a celebration with Caleb. She made him a birthday cake after his first week, cupcakes for his second week, cookies for  his third week, and so on. She celebrated everything about Caleb, for every day was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the boy who was  sent home without hope.</p>
<p>In what might have looked like a burdensome task to others, caring for Caleb became a privilege. Though his  body was misshapen and broken, his spirit was whole, noble, and great.<sup>5</sup> Being in his presence was healing and heavenly. I love my  wife and thank her, Caleb, and Heavenly Father for making the time with Caleb not only possible but powerful. It was indeed heaven on  earth.</p>
<p>Even his missing eye was a blessing. It became his distinctive feature. People were drawn to him, especially children. They  would often ask, “Where is his eye? What happened to him?”</p>
<p>I would usually say that Caleb was a pirate or that a bear had eaten his  eye. But my wife would explain that in our family, a wink meant “I love you.”</p>
<p>Before Caleb was born, we told our boys that he would  only have one of his eyes. They were concerned for their brother.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” April would say. “He will just wink at us every  day!”</p>
<p>Caleb was never able to tell us he loved us with words, but he told us every day with his wink. His little wink was a daily  message of love from heaven. He brought the love of God and the Light of Christ into the lives of all who knew him. His winking eye was a sweet  reminder of his deep love for all of us.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Hope and courage have always characterized the righteous. Ever the optimist,  Joseph Smith was once quoted as saying:</p>
<p><i>I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties should surround me, if I was sunk  in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged but hang on, exercise faith and  keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap.</i><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>It was this type of faithful fortitude that  saved the Nephites from the decree of death declared by the unbelievers if the sign of Christ’s birth did not come. It came the very night that  Nephi prayed.<sup>8</sup> Likewise, a measure of firm faith and trust in God preceded the parting of the Red Sea;<sup>9</sup> saved Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abed-nego from a fiery furnace;<sup>10</sup> and helped David defeat a giant.<sup>11</sup></p>
<h2><b>Recognize God’s Ways Are  Higher</b></h2>
<p>However, not all miracles deliver. Sometimes, according to God’s purposes, miracles are seemingly withheld in order for His  greater designs to develop. After all, Abinadi was burned at the stake, the Mormons were driven out of Jackson County, and Joseph Smith was  martyred at Carthage Jail. On a less important scale, but still significant to those involved, lost puppies may not be found, testing center  prayers may not be immediately answered, and Church basketball games may not be played with good sportsmanship in spite of prayers offered  otherwise.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean God is absent or doesn’t care or hasn’t provided a miracle. Again, it is during those times when it  is ten degrees colder that God is involved, He does care, and He is performing His work. We must remember that “as the heavens are higher than  the earth, so are [His] ways higher than [our] ways, and [His] thoughts than [our] thoughts.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Just imagine what would  happen if miracles were left up to us. In my arena of athletics, it would probably go something like this: The Church is true. The Church is the  sponsoring organization of BYU, the Lord’s university. The BYU sports teams are flagships of the university. Therefore, no BYU team should ever  lose, which would be irrefutable evidence that the Church is true. What a blessing this would be to the growth of the Church. I can picture the  missionaries talking to an investigator: “Brother Jones, as you know, the BYU football team has never lost, the basketball team has won every  national title, and each of our golfers gets a hole in one on every swing. Don’t you think it’s about time you were  baptized?”</p>
<p>Obviously the Lord does not work this way. A plan in which supposedly everything would go right so nobody would be lost was  already proposed and rejected. The plan of salvation, on the other hand, allows for opposition in all things: sadness and sweetness, wrongdoing  and repentance, trial and testimony.</p>
<p>With so much opposition in our lives at times, it seems like God chooses to work through  underdogs. Take Gideon of the Old Testament, for example. Israel was in bondage to the Midianites. God called Gideon to deliver them, and Gideon  raised an army of 32,000 men.</p>
<p><i>And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the  Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</i><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>God  asked Gideon to reduce his army to 10,000, which was still too many. God then asked him to reduce his force even further to just 300 men to go  against a foe who were “like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for  multitude.”<sup>14</sup> With the help of God and against all odds, Gideon and those 300 men bested the Midianites and their tens of  thousands.</p>
<p>God is clearly not limited by the same constraints that obstruct our mortal way. Left on their own, Gideon and his 300  would have had little chance for victory. But Gideon was not alone, nor is he the only instance of God using small and simple “means to bring  about his great and eternal purposes.”<sup>15</sup> God took Enoch, a lad slow of speech, and walked with him.</p>
<p><i>And so great  was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God . . . ; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled,  even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course . . . ; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was  the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.</i><sup>16</sup></p>
<p>God also took former  Egyptian slaves and molded them into the mighty Israelite nation. He turned a fisherman into a chief apostle. And He shaped a plowboy into a  prophet.<sup>17</sup> The Lord Himself came to earth in the most humble of circumstances—as a babe in a manger who was born into a carpenter’s  family and who became Lord of lords, King of kings,<sup>18</sup> and Savior of worlds without end.</p>
<h2><b>Trust God</b></h2>
<p>Such miraculous  transformations come as a result of trusting in God’s plan. One night for family scripture study we read the account of the “man which was blind  from his birth.”<sup>19</sup> The “disciples asked [Christ], saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born  blind?”<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Seeing the obvious parallel in our own home, our young sons asked why Caleb was born blind. In the next verse the  Lord provided our response: “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in  him.”<sup>21</sup> Then Jesus healed the man so that he could see.</p>
<p>Caught up in the grandeur of the story, our boys asked if I could  heal Caleb. I stammered some kind of response that I didn’t feel it was the Lord’s will for Caleb to be healed. I added that often the healings  recorded in the scriptures were performed by Jesus, prophets, or apostles—very righteous men commissioned by God to perform miracles for  specific purposes of blessing the lives of those involved and increasing the faith of those who would eventually read these  stories.</p>
<p>Not to be put off, and possibly sensing my apprehensive response, my boys faithfully concluded that it was time to appeal to  a higher authority. It so happened that we were going to the Church Administration Building later that week to attend the setting apart of my  dad as a mission president by one of the Brethren. Knowing that we would be meeting an apostle, my sons requested that I ask him to heal  Caleb.</p>
<p>Talk about being put between a rock and a hard place. How could I sustain their faith without selfishly imposing on an apostle?  I compromised with my boys by telling them that I would not ask for a blessing on Caleb but that we would leave it in the hands of the  Lord.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful occasion to be with my dad as he was set apart and to be in the presence of one of the Lord’s special  witnesses. He was not inspired to heal Caleb. But as we walked out of his office, he stopped at Caleb’s stroller, bent down, and kissed him. He  told him three times that he loved him. He then shook my hand and hugged my wife while whispering in her ear, “I am so proud of you.” In the  sight of God, Caleb did not need healing. Instead, it was I who left that office peacefully whole.</p>
<h2><b>Rely on His Timing</b></h2>
<p>Trusting  in God means that we also trust in His timing. The man in the New Testament story was blind from birth. I’m not sure how old he was, but he had  waited years for that miracle. Then one day the Master came along and healed him. “In his own time, and in his own way,”<sup>22</sup> God will  respond.</p>
<p>As an example of the Lord’s timing in my life, I had been at my new job in the BYU Athletic Department for about three weeks  when I had to go down to Las Vegas for a business meeting as part of the conference basketball tournament. I woke up very early to make the long  drive in time for my meeting at noon. My wife and I prayed fervently that I would make it safely. Caleb had been in the hospital for a few  weeks, and we had been up many late nights to be with him. Despite every precaution and physical effort I could make, just outside of St. George  I fell asleep in the blink of an eye while driving full speed down the freeway.</p>
<p>I woke up to find myself heading down a hill into the  median dividing the highway—one set of tires on the pavement, the other set in the weeds and gravel. I quickly spun the wheel to take me back on  the road, but this only caused me to do a 180-degree turn across the lanes of traffic. Thankfully no other cars were near me. Once I got to the  far right side of the road, I had the fleeting thought that I could pull it off and would be able to stop the car on the right shoulder. Not so.  I think the car was still traveling about 60 to 70 miles per hour when I slammed into the sand and sagebrush, flipping the car  over.</p>
<p>Eventually the car came to an abrupt stop with me hanging upside down by my seat belt. I undid the catch and fell to the  floor—which had been the roof of the car. It was impossible to open any of the car doors. They were all wedged shut because the car had become  fairly flattened to the ground. I climbed through a window, since all the glass in the vehicle had shattered.</p>
<p>Besides a bruised and  embarrassed ego, I was completely unharmed. The only cut I had was a small slice on my hand where a piece of glass had stuck me when I released  myself from the seat belt and fell to the ground. After being checked out by the police (who also issued me a ticket), my sweet grandmother who  lived in St. George somehow let me borrow her car so I could finish my trip to Las Vegas. I walked into my meeting about fifteen minutes  late.</p>
<p>The hard part was telling my boss, Tom Holmoe—who was also at the basketball tournament—that I had destroyed a university  vehicle during my first month on the job. To make a bad situation worse, my seat at the basketball game following the meeting happened to be  directly in front of President Samuelson. I spent the game pulling glass out of my hair as inconspicuously as possible.</p>
<p>In my mind the  timing of that wreck was life turning one degree colder. I was trying to make a good first impression at my job. My wife and I were doing our  best to take care of a sick child. We had prayed for safety.</p>
<p>The Lord’s timing and purpose were made clear over the following days and  months. Tom is a great boss and has never held the accident and the loss of the car against me. The university eventually replaced the car but  thankfully didn’t have to replace me—because I was still alive. The Lord had preserved me from what should have been a fatal accident. Having  come so close to death helped me more fully appreciate my life and the people around me. I especially enjoyed the time spent with Caleb late at  night when I would wake up to take care of him. Not only did it mean I was still alive, but Caleb was too.</p>
<p>There were times when I  thought Caleb would live a long time. He had so often successfully battled sicknesses and surgeries, illnesses and infections. He had been to  the hospital many times but always came back to us. We loved having him in our home. “Caleb could have quickly returned to heaven but, instead,  he brought heaven to us for seven years.”<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Twenty-five days ago, in the timing of the Lord, Caleb slipped peacefully away  while being held in the arms of his mother and surrounded by his family. He had spent a courageous day fighting with his might against a vicious  infection brought on by pneumonia. The wonderful doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel at Primary Children’s Medical Center had done all  they professionally could to keep Caleb alive. His body was simply too worn out.</p>
<p>I have heroes in my life: Joseph Smith, Captain  Moroni, Ammon, and others. On that day, my wife was my hero. As she bravely and tenderly leaned down to hug Caleb, she whispered in his ear, “I  love you, Caleb. I am so proud of you. If your body is too tired, it’s okay. You can go back. You can return to Heavenly Father.”</p>
<p>For  over seven years her love and God’s will allowed Caleb to be a significant part of our earthly experience. But in the very moment when it was  needed, her heart changed. She could let him go. She trusted God because she knew God. She knew that God understood her personally, in a way  that few others could, for God had also lost a son. And through the Atonement of that Son, God can do miracles. He can forgive a sinner. He can  save a lost soul. He can heal a broken heart.</p>
<p>“With God nothing [is] impossible,”<sup>24</sup> especially when life is hard and it is  ten degrees colder outside. “But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.”<sup>25</sup> God provides the  plan and we contribute the faith and courage. We trust in His timing and in His ways to achieve His purposes, even when—and probably  <i>especially</i> when—such purposes may be unclear from our perspective.</p>
<p>At a stake conference not too long ago, I had an interview  with a visiting General Authority. He learned about Caleb as part of our discussion. After he acknowledged the hard work it took to care for  Caleb, I thought he would then encourage me to keep it up and to faithfully persevere in the service and sacrifice I was providing. Instead, his  next four words entirely transformed my relationship with Caleb. He simply said, “You are being exalted.”</p>
<p>All this time I had thought  that we were taking care of Caleb. But in reality, God, through Caleb, had been taking care of us. God was making a miracle where I hadn’t  expected one. He was performing a miracle on me, on my wife, on our kids, and on all those who came in contact with Caleb. Having Caleb in our  home was an honor and a privilege. It was also a sacred experience.</p>
<p>Through our faith, courage, hope, and trust, God will bless us—no  matter how cold our lives may feel. I know that God loves us. I know that He hears us and heals us. And I know that He is exalting us. In the  name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Six years ago President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave a profound conference talk entitled “You Matter to Him.”1 In his talk he explained that God is the Creator of all things and yet is concerned about each one of us individually. Today I would like to build upon President Uchtdorf’s topic and title my remarks “BYU Matters to Him.” However, I would like to redefine the acronym for Brigham Young University as B-Y-You, as in you (y-o-u). Thus the title of my address is “B-Y-You Matter to Him.”
This past semester one of my students submitted the following account. With her permission, I share her tender feelings about when she first arrived at BYU:
 Leaving everything you have known for the entirety of your life to attend a university that is 547 miles away is difficult. You can no longer lean on the support of your family and friends; you can no longer enjoy the safety and security of your home; you can no longer simply follow your parents. Your life is in your own hands, and it is terrifying. I distinctly remember the hurricane of emotions I experienced as I bid farewell to my dad as he drove away, leaving me standing outside my dorm with five people I had never met. I had to make my own food, and I felt sorely unprepared. Actually, I felt more than unprepared—I felt absolutely and entirely lost.
My student then went on to describe her feelings that day as those of “ultimate vulnerability.”2
As I pondered my student’s feelings of vulnerability and isolation, I felt a personal surge of déjà vu from when I first arrived at BYU some forty-seven years ago. My student’s account stirred within me some tender and painful emotions from decades past. I suspect that many of you here today can also recall the daunting memories of when you first arrived on this campus. As I address you today, perhaps some of you find yourself in the throes of similar feelings of trepidation or of being lost.
The Greatness of BYU
I do not mean to minimize these feelings of loneliness or intimidation, but they present a marked contrast to the feelings we first had when we were accepted to BYU. Consider the following glossy accolades and advantages of attending Brigham Young University.
BYU consistently ranks in the top 25 percent of national universities.3 BYU is in the top five of the best value universities4 and costs around $30,000 less per year than other private schools.5 Consequently, BYU students graduate with substantially less debt.6 BYU is the number-one stone-cold sober university,7 and students will never have to tolerate drunk classmates or professors. Also, BYU has launched more of its ­students into PhD programs than Harvard, Yale, or Stanford.8 Upon arrival, every student here has a church unit waiting to receive and support them. Additionally, more than 60 percent of the students</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Many years ago I discovered a book of poetry entitled In the Stillness Is the Dancing. Within the pages of this book is a poem entitled “Don’t Miss the Miracle,” compiled from the essay “If I Had Three Days to See,” written by Helen Keller in 1933. I would like to begin my address today by sharing this poem with you:
I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things
to interest me through mere touch.
I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf.
I pass my hands lovingly
about the smooth skin of a silver birch,
or the rough shaggy bark of a pine . . .
I feel the delightful, velvety texture of a flower,
and discover its remarkable convolutions;
and something of the miracle of Nature
is revealed to me.
Occasionally, if I am very fortunate,
I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel
the happy quiver of a bird in full song . . .
At times my heart cries out with longing
to see these things.
If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch,
how much more beauty must be revealed
by sight.
Yet, those who have eyes apparently see little.
The panorama of color and action
which fills the world is taken for granted . . .
It is . . . a great pity that, in the world of light,
the gift of sight
is used only as a mere convenience rather than
as a means of adding fullness to life.
[Mark Link, In the Stillness Is the Dancing (Niles, Illinois: Argus Communications, 1972), 36–37]
What does it mean to see? Webster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language lists 25 definitions for the word see ([New York: Gramercy Books, 1989], 1290). The first is “to perceive with the eyes; look at.” Being both blind and deaf, according to this definition Helen Keller indeed could not see. However, according to other Webster definitions of the word, which include “to perceive,” “discern,” “recognize,” “have insight,” and “understand intellectually or spiritually,” Helen Keller not only saw very clearly but, through her writing, admonished us to do the same.
Within the myriad of experiences we encounter every day, how much does each of us really see? How much do we allow the light that illuminates our world to permeate our beings? To what degree do we allow light to enlighten?
What is light? Again I turn to Webster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (828), which defines light as “that which makes things visible or affords illumination.” In the first chapter of John we are told:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During my career as a professional opera singer, I spent months and sometimes years in preparation for an important concert or stage production. One thing was certain and unavoidable: the time would arrive when I had to stand on the stage in front of thousands of people and sing. This musical accountability was swift and very audible—to my credit or shame. Immediately I could see the quality of my performance reflected in the face of the conductor.
As we anxiously await and prepare for the hallmark events in our lives, it feels at times as if they will never arrive. We fantasize in anticipation of getting our first driver’s license or graduating from high school, attending college, going on a mission, getting married, experiencing the birth of a child, and much more. Just as surely as these highly anticipated events will arrive and pass, so will the time of our mortality come to an end. As Jacob in the Book of Mormon recorded: It will pass “as it were unto us a dream” (Jacob 7:26).
All of us have dreams, aspirations, and solid goals. As we use our allotted days and years to bring them to fruition, there are six principles I have found that, when practiced, can dramatically affect the outcome of our lives. They can bring us many wonderful blessings and even miracles that can build our faith and shape our lives in ways we never thought possible. Hopefully, when we stand face-to-face with our Savior, our inevitable reunion can be sweet beyond measure as we see the quality of our earthly performance reflected in His smiling face.
I have been asked to share some of my life’s experiences with you. In doing so, I do not wish to glory or boast in my own strength or talent. But, like Ammon, I do glory in my Savior and His goodness (see Alma 26:35–36). It is with deep gratitude and humility that I recount these very personal events. I pray that through my testimony the following principles may assist you in experiencing ways in which the Lord can make a miracle in your life and of your life as you move toward this future reunion.
Principle One: Make the Lord Your Partner as You Prepare
As we read the scriptures and observe President Hinckley’s examples of “ordinary people who are engaged in an extraordinary undertaking,” an unmistakable pattern and path to the extraordinary becomes evident (Gordon B. Hinckley, “The State of the Church,” Ensign, November 2003, 7). All of the following men drew themselves away—most of them in fasting and mighty prayer—to receive direction and the strength to do what must be done. Moses on Mount Sinai, Nephi, Enos, Joseph Smith, and President Kimball—to name but a few—all formed a solid partnership with their Creator. All were feeling inadequate. All had monumental assignments or decisions to make. Even the most extraordinary being on this earth, Christ Himself, found it necessary to draw Himself away for 40 days before com</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Our lives are alive with patterns. Think about it: We are surrounded by patterns. In a sense we live our lives in discovering, identifying, tracing, or following patterns. We awaken in the morning to the sun’s diurnal pattern; our bodies function and malfunction in patterns suggested by our patterned DNA. Our education consists of learning and testing patterns. Our sciences and mathematics are centered in formulaic patterns, as are our works of art, drama, music, dance, and literature. Our games, from hopscotch and Monopoly to football, are patterned play. And every year, as the pattern of the seasons moves from fall to winter, the BYU Cougars follow a well-worn pattern to the Western Athletic Conference championship—but not without the 10,000 prayers of the Saints who see a clear providential analogy, parallel, or pattern between the Cougars’ gridiron triumphs and the triumphant progression of the restored Church.
The poet Wallace Stevens describes as the “blessed rage for order” our inborn human need for orderly, predictable, and stable patterns to offset disorder and uncertainty (Wallace Stevens, “The Idea of Order at Key West,” The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, eds. Richard Ellmann and Robert O’Clair [New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1973], pp. 251–52). In fact, patterns order chaos, lessen our concerns with life’s mutability, identify progress, promote social happiness, and clothe our lives with a larger sense of continuity and meaning. Patterns help us to promote and maintain our individual and group values. Indeed, wo, wo be unto those who attempt, willfully or inadvertently, to shortcut, skirt, or flout the vital patterns of our codes of law, our social or moral codes of conduct, or etiquette. Such will pay a penalty. Wo be unto the member of Congress who gets caught ignoring the patterns, to the student who audaciously marries two independent clauses with a comma, to the foolish husband who installs a new roll of toilet paper so it unrolls from behind instead of over; and wo be unto those pattern-shattering fast Sunday visitors who invade my ward six minutes early and capture, occupy, and hold my pew in the center section, back row, right aisle, seats 1 and 2. We are indeed pattern-centered and pattern-driven beings.
I believe such an abundance of patterns reflects not only a divine ordering of existence but provides mortal pattern-seekers with yet another way in which the power of the Godhead can be present with us. I hope this morning to lift your vision beyond the multitude of mundane patterns that drive our dailinesses to more important spiritual patterns, which, though invisible, often become as surprising, clear, and instructive to the pattern-discerner as was the outstretched finger of the Lord to the brother of Jared. I invite you to become for a few minutes a spiritual pattern-tracer of a few of the many divine patterns that can become Liahonas in helping us to define our m</span>
