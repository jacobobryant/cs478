  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Elder Snow, Elder Johnson, other General Authorities and officers, President Worthen, members of the President’s Council, other administrative leaders, faculty, students, friends, families, and guests, just one year ago, as I stood at this podium nearing the conclusion of my assignment here at BYU, I was quite confi-dent that it was the last time I would have the privilege of greeting and addressing a commencement gather-ing of this great and unique university. Obviously I was wrong about that, as I have been about some other things over the years. But I am glad that I came.

I am particularly grateful to Professor Robert George for his wonderful and insightful com-ments. He has been a mentor to many and a great friend and supporter of Brigham Young Univer-sity and has been helpful to our church. We are honored that he is now part of our group.

What I was not wrong about was my appreciation, affection, and admiration for Brigham Young University. In fact, those sentiments have only increased in the year that we have been away. Today my gratitude is full for the thoughtful friends and associates who have made possible this honor that if not deserved is nevertheless received with a happy heart and thankful thoughts for all that BYU has come to mean to Sharon and to me.

While our interest in and fondness for you and for the people and the institution that consti-tute Brigham Young University have not lessened one whit, we no longer worry about the details or specific challenges you face because we have full confidence in the current leadership of Presi-dent Worthen and his team and all of you as you lead BYU to even greater heights and accom-plishments. We learned while being privileged to be directly associated with you that this very special place is not solely dependent—nor will it ever be—on specific individuals. On the other hand, it is also true that everyone so blessed to be a part of BYU in any way has the opportunity to contribute to and advance the sacred mission of this most remarkable and important “house of learning.”

One of the blessings of being somewhat removed this past year is that we have been more able to reflect on the big picture of what this university is and where it is going without being preoccu-pied with necessary but largely temporary details that may deflect from consideration of those things most important, like those that Professor George mentioned. Just one example might be helpful in understanding how we feel.

In our current assignment at the Salt Lake Temple we see and meet a very large number of people on an almost daily basis. You might imagine the intense pleasure we feel when we see and are greeted by students, former students, and other BYU associates in that setting. We occasionally chuckle when long-term workers at the temple seem surprised that we, as relative newcomers, are recognized by so many who come to the temple. For that alone we owe much to BYU.

In retrospect, our time, like yours, passed quickly while being fully immersed in what tran-spires in this very special place. What does not pass quickly, and perhaps is even permanently en-during, is the influence for good that emanates from BYU. This imprint is both individual in the lives of those blessed to be here and collective in the impact for good in our various societies and social systems. As I read regularly of the important research results coming from our scholars, I am happily impressed with the significant contributions being made to the global good.

These gifts cover a broad spectrum of the arts and sciences and are not unlike those coming from other great universities. But, and this is particularly important, there are unique contributions made by and at BYU that give reason for the faith that is within us of the reality of our living Fa-ther in Heaven; His Beloved Son, the Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ; and the holy plan for each of us. In this regard, defense of the family and religious liberty generally receives and deserves to receive the best efforts of this heaven-supported university that we all love and cherish.

As I conclude my expression of gratitude for all that BYU has done and does, I invite all of you to join me in pledging to continue in our own lives the tremendous work and endeavor that justi-fies the enormous expenditures and sacrifices that allow for the happy circumstances we enjoy in what we collectively can describe as our BYU experience. May God bless us that this will be so, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Elder Snow, Elder Johnson, other General Authorities and officers, President Worthen, members of the President’s Council, other administrative leaders, faculty, students, friends, families, and guests, just one year ago, as I stood at this podium nearing the conclusion of my assignment here at BYU, I was quite confi-dent that it was the last time I would have the privilege of greeting and addressing a commencement gather-ing of this great and unique university. Obviously I was wrong about that, as I have been about some other things over the years. But I am glad that I came.</p>
<p>I am particularly grateful to Professor Robert George for his wonderful and insightful com-ments. He has been a mentor to many and a great friend and supporter of Brigham Young Univer-sity and has been helpful to our church. We are honored that he is now part of our group.</p>
<p>What I was not wrong about was my appreciation, affection, and admiration for Brigham Young University. In fact, those sentiments have only increased in the year that we have been away. Today my gratitude is full for the thoughtful friends and associates who have made possible this honor that if not deserved is nevertheless received with a happy heart and thankful thoughts for all that BYU has come to mean to Sharon and to me.</p>
<p>While our interest in and fondness for you and for the people and the institution that consti-tute Brigham Young University have not lessened one whit, we no longer worry about the details or specific challenges you face because we have full confidence in the current leadership of Presi-dent Worthen and his team and all of you as you lead BYU to even greater heights and accom-plishments. We learned while being privileged to be directly associated with you that this very special place is not solely dependent—nor will it ever be—on specific individuals. On the other hand, it is also true that everyone so blessed to be a part of BYU in any way has the opportunity to contribute to and advance the sacred mission of this most remarkable and important “house of learning.”</p>
<p>One of the blessings of being somewhat removed this past year is that we have been more able to reflect on the big picture of what this university is and where it is going without being preoccu-pied with necessary but largely temporary details that may deflect from consideration of those things most important, like those that Professor George mentioned. Just one example might be helpful in understanding how we feel.</p>
<p>In our current assignment at the Salt Lake Temple we see and meet a very large number of people on an almost daily basis. You might imagine the intense pleasure we feel when we see and are greeted by students, former students, and other BYU associates in that setting. We occasionally chuckle when long-term workers at the temple seem surprised that we, as relative newcomers, are recognized by so many who come to the temple. For that alone we owe much to BYU.</p>
<p>In retrospect, our time, like yours, passed quickly while being fully immersed in what tran-spires in this very special place. What does not pass quickly, and perhaps is even permanently en-during, is the influence for good that emanates from BYU. This imprint is both individual in the lives of those blessed to be here and collective in the impact for good in our various societies and social systems. As I read regularly of the important research results coming from our scholars, I am happily impressed with the significant contributions being made to the global good.</p>
<p>These gifts cover a broad spectrum of the arts and sciences and are not unlike those coming from other great universities. But, and this is particularly important, there are unique contributions made by and at BYU that give reason for the faith that is within us of the reality of our living Fa-ther in Heaven; His Beloved Son, the Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ; and the holy plan for each of us. In this regard, defense of the family and religious liberty generally receives and deserves to receive the best efforts of this heaven-supported university that we all love and cherish.</p>
<p>As I conclude my expression of gratitude for all that BYU has done and does, I invite all of you to join me in pledging to continue in our own lives the tremendous work and endeavor that justi-fies the enormous expenditures and sacrifices that allow for the happy circumstances we enjoy in what we collectively can describe as our BYU experience. May God bless us that this will be so, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><i>Cecil O. Samuelson, former president of Brigham Young University, received an honorary doctorate when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
