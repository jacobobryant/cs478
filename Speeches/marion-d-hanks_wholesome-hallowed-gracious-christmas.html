  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Its an honor to be here. Although my present competence is geared more to a first-position version of "Flow Gently, Sweet Afton," my years with the violin so long ago perhaps qualify me to express deep gratitude and some appreciation for that magnificent music. I am thankful.

It had occurred to me that I might talk today about a subject such as voluntary compliance with established standards, but I drove here on the freeway. I think I wont discuss that subject today. Instead, Id like to talk to you about the season. I am aware that examinations are dead ahead and would hope that in some marvelous way the alchemy of this special time of year might dissuade us temporarily from contemplating them and permit us to join together in consideration of this wonderful holy day season, which I love. I love its sights, its sounds, its scents, the thoughts and feelings that it inspires, its songs, its sentiments. I love the tenderness it evokes, the gratitude and generosity, the sensitivity to thanks and to giving, its acts of kindness and of love, the effect on family. I love what it does to release friendliness and goodwill between one man and another, which most of us keep under pretty rigid control the rest of the year. There are occasions, of course, when those carefully reserved feelings come forth naturally and spontaneously, as, for instance, when were caught under an awning in a downpour, or waiting behind a snowplow, or joined together in distress or action in the face of some calamity or personal difficulty. But of all these occasions, Christmas seems to be chief among those which bring out from good men, and maybe some of us less than good, those repressed emotions of brotherliness and kindliness.

I love the Christmas season. I love its spirit and its memories. It was at Christmas long ago that a tiny girl nestled snugly in my arms in the middle of the night and sighed with relief. She had been upchucking, perhaps from a slight overdose of excitement and anticipation, mixed with the seasons largess of goodies. "Daddy," she said, "for a while I was afraid I was going to lose the Christmas spirit."

And I love to remember the little hand on my knee as we rode through soft flakes of snow to our grandmothers on Christmas morning. We had been singing with the carolers on the radio when she said, "What does it mean to adore him?"

I worked at an answer, but every attempt engendered more questions and further efforts to explain until finally, compassionately, she laid that little hand on my knee and said, "I guess to adore him just means to love him."

Well, I come this morning with three themes, or one theme and two variations, to express briefly my love for the season. The theme is centered in a few words in a very familiar song, much like the one we sang together. These are the words. Have you heard them as well as sung them?

&lt;i&gt;Joy to the world, the Lord is come.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Let earth receive her King.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Let every heart prepare him room,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And heaven and nature sing.&lt;/i&gt;

Seven hundred years before he came, Isaiah sang a sweet psalm of his coming:

&lt;i&gt;The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&lt;/i&gt; [Isaiah 9:2, 6]

His advent, of course, had been long anticipated. In Gods plan there was place and need for a sacrifice, an atoning sacrifice for sin. And so he came in due season, not as man anticipated but as God directed. There wasnt any pomp; there were no blaring trumpets, no parade or ceremony, no army, no array of great ones ushering in the King. There was a crowded inn, a manger, a mother and a baby, some shepherds, and some wise men, unconscious of their different stations. There were angels and a message for those who had ears to hear.

&lt;i&gt;They were all looking for a king&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To set them free and lift them high;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thou earnest, a little baby thing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To make a woman cry.&lt;/i&gt;
[Author unknown]

He grew, served, taught, learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and did, as he had been sent to do, the will of his Father.

When the appointed time came he was accused, mocked, arrayed in a purple robe. They platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head. They smote him with a reed and took him to be crucified. He was lifted up upon the cross by man that he might, as he said, "draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil" (3 Nephi 27:14).

On the cross he comforted those who suffered with him, he invoked the forgiveness of his Father for those who took his life, and in anguish he cried out to the God whose face for the moment may have been turned away from the awful scene - who knows, perhaps to wipe a tear. "Truly this was the Son of God," said the centurion (Matthew 27:54). He rose, as we know, at the appointed time from the tomb in which he had been tenderly laid - the first that should rise. Resurrected, he companied for many days with his apostles and others, ascended to heaven as they watched him, visited his people in the American hemisphere and taught them, appeared to Paul and to Stephen, and in the last dispensation, with his Father, revealed himself to a boy prophet. As he promised, he will come again. For all of that I give thanks. I bear testimony that it is true. He will come again.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Thanksgiving Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My first variation on the theme then, is thanksgiving, the second, and briefest part of this message. Christmas - and every other important holiday, it occurs to me - is a thanksgiving time: to mothers, to the founders of our country and the fathers of our free society, to those who have offered their lives to keep it free, to our loved ones departed, and at Christmas (always and every day, of course, but especially at Christmas) to God our Father and his holy Son, Jesus Christ. The past year has been full of perplexing problems; the possibilities ahead are certainly sobering in prospect. Yet the Christmas season brings to our hearts the spirit of thanks and of giving.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wholesome, Hallowed, Gracious&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
With Christ and gratitude and giving in our minds, then let me share with you the third part, or the second variation. It comes from another source, from another time. From Hamlet we read:

&lt;i&gt;Some say that ever gainst that season comes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This bird of dawning singeth all night long;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;So hallowed and so gracious is that time.&lt;/i&gt;
[Hamlet, 1.i.15864]

&lt;i&gt;Wholesome, hallowed, gracious&lt;/i&gt; - what wonderful words. I love them. They represent to me all that Christmas and the season may mean. Think of them with me for a moment.

How to make the season &lt;i&gt;wholesome? &lt;/i&gt;Why, by glancing healthfully inward for a moment. By seeking to bring ourselves more nearly to that measure of wholeness, of integrity, of unity with loftiest desires, of congruence with richest spiritual feeling, of harmony with that person that I would fondly like to be.
&lt;h2&gt;Wholesome: the Master of Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;
Many years ago a great man who taught at this university gave us a vision of the importance of that harmony. When I graduated from high school I wanted to come to Brigham Young University, with his name and face and strengths in mind. I really had in mind Harrison R. Merrill and BYU, in that order. If you know it well, rejoice with me; if not, be introduced to one of his greatest poems. He called it "Christmas Eve on the Desert."

&lt;i&gt;Tonight, not one alone am I, but three - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Lad I was, the Man I am, and he&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who looks adown the coming future years&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And wonders at my sloth. His hopes and fears&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Should goad me to the manly game&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Of adding to the honor of my name.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Im Fate to him - that chap thats I, grown old.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No matter how much stocks and land and gold&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I save for him, he cant buy back a single day&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On which I built a pattern for his way.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I, in turn, am product of that Boy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who rarely thought of After Selves. His joy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Was in the present. He might have saved me woe &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Had he but thought. The ways that I must go&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are his. He marked them all for me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And I must follow - and so must he - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;My Future Self - Unless I save him!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Save? - Somehow that word,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Deep down, a precious thought has stirred&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Savior? - Yes, Im savior to that "Me."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That thoughtful After Person whom I see! - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The thought is staggering! I sit and gaze&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;At my two Other Selves, joint keepers of my days!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Master of Christmas, You dared to bleed and die&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That others might find life. How much more I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Should willingly give up my present days&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To lofty deeds; seek out the ways&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To build a splendid life. I should not fail&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To set my feet upon the star-bound trail&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For him - that After Self. You said that he&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Whod lose his life should find it, and I know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You found a larger life, still live and grow.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Your doctrine was, so Ive been told, serve man.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I wonder if Im doing all I can&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To serve? Will serving help that Older Me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To be the man hed fondly like to be?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Last night I passed a shack&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where hunger lurked. I must go back&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And take a lamb, Is that the message of the Star&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Whose rays, please God, can shine this far?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tonight, not one alone am I, but three - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Lad I was, the Man I am, and he&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who is my Future Self - nay, more:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I am His savior - that thought makes me four!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Master of Christmas, that Star of Thine shines clear - &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Bless Thou the four of me - out here!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Wholesome, hallowed, gracious.&lt;/i&gt;

The angelic message was "Peace on earth, goodwill to men." We do not despair of peace; yet we know something of history and something of the scriptures and something of present complexities, and we know that no one of us nor all of us here together can govern the world of men and their decisions. There is something we can do about peace in our lives and peace between us and our families and our neighbors - something - but we cannot control an insatiable world and the decisions of many men. But goodwill to men, what of that? Many of you are already experts in that adventure, but perhaps others have yet to learn that goodwill, like love, is more than language.

Do you know the words of Millay?

&lt;i&gt;Love is not all; it is not meat nor drink,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nor yet a floating spar to men who sink.&lt;/i&gt;
[Edna St. Vincent Millay]

God so loved that he gave. Christ so loved that he gave. What of us? I remember the impressive words of Bonhoeffer, who said of Jesus that he was a man for others; and the words of Luther, who in his great speech on good works talked of Mary, who, having heard the announcement, went about her life preparing, not retired from the active scene because she had such knowledge, but involved in giving and growing and preparing.
&lt;h2&gt;Gracious: Brotherly Love and Giving&lt;/h2&gt;
For &lt;i&gt;graciousness, &lt;/i&gt;how do you like the marvelous, simple story of the little boy who saw the bright, new automobile and said to its owner, walking about it on Christmas Eve:

&lt;i&gt;"Is that your car, Mister?"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The man nodded. "My brother gave it to me for Christmas."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The boy looked astounded. "You mean your brother gave it to you and it didnt cost you nothing? Gosh, I wish - " He hesitated, and the man knew what he was going to wish. He was going to wish that he had a brother like that. But what the lad said jarred him all the way down to his heels. "I wish," the boy went on, "that I could be a brother like that."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Paul looked at the boy in astonishment. Then impulsively he said, "Would you like a ride in my automobile?"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Yes," said the little boy.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;After a short ride, the youngster, his eyes aglow, said, "Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?" Paul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the lad wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile. But he was wrong again. "Will you stop by those two steps?" the boy asked. He ran up the steps. In a little while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little polio-crippled brother. He sat him down on the bottom step, sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car. "There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother give it to him for Christmas and it didnt cost him a cent. And some day Im going to give you one just like it. Then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that Ive been trying to tell you about."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Paul got out and lifted the little lad to the front seat of his car. The shiny-eyed older brother climbed in beside him, and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;That Christmas Eve Paul learned what Jesus meant about brotherliness and giving.&lt;/i&gt; [C. Roy Angell, in &lt;i&gt;Guideposts&lt;/i&gt;]

And if I may add it, Id like to tell you another thing I love very much about Christmas. I love to remember what the scripture says, and perhaps you are well aware of it: "Let brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares" (Hebrews 13:12).

There was a night when we had the blessing of having in our home a stranger, sorely afflicted. After all these years I have some hesitance to mention the incident, lest anyone know or connect her with it. She was from far away. She was away from her family. She had been incarcerated in institutions, had been released to go to her parents in another state, also far away, but after months of little progression and apparently with little hope in sight, had been relieved of her restraints there. Having affiliation with the Church, she found her way to Salt Lake City, to Temple Square, which she thought to be the heart of the Church, and sat across the desk from me, hopeless, her eyes blank, talking about her children, talking intermittently also about the voices she heard. She was ill. There was no appropriate place to send her, so we took her home.

Our holiday season was impaired a bit, as I now impair the memory by the repetition. That didnt matter much. We missed a few parties; we felt someone should be with her, because she was obviously seriously ill. We didnt know the therapy; we knew how to pray to God, and she joined us with our then very little family. The days went by. Christmas arrived. That morning she arose with us. She sat in a chair and watched as the presents were given and received. For everyone received by anyone else, she also received a gift. I fancied I saw the curtain going up a little. I watched a tear come trickling, and then, without premeditation and certainly without instruction, a little girl climbed onto her knee, put her arms around her neck, and said, "Susannah, I love you." And the tears gushed and the curtain rose and the humanity came through. She wept, then talked freely about her little ones, about her husband at home, about her problems.

A little later I made a telephone call. I spoke to a man who was agonizing through the day. He didnt want her away, but her illness had made it improbable to have her home. I talked with him of her present circumstance. He said, "Is there any way to get her home?" We found a way. There was an airplane and gracious people who made way, and a lady who got nervously aboard and soon thereafter arrived home to the arms of her own loved ones. She wrote us regularly for many years to thank us for a simple gift of brotherliness at a special time.
&lt;h2&gt;More Important than a King&lt;/h2&gt;
Oh, I love the words &lt;i&gt;wholesome, hallowed, gracious. &lt;/i&gt;Among the many wonderful things I would like to remind you about, I love and will conclude with a brief statement from a great book written long ago. It is about a slave who lived in Christs time and watched him on a certain special Sunday in the midst of a multitude.

&lt;i&gt;Suddenly, for no reason at all that Demetrius could observe, there was a wave of excitement. It swept down over the sluggish swollen stream of zealots like a sharp breeze. Men all about him were breaking loose from their families, tossing their packs into the arms of their overburdened children, and racing forward toward some urgent attraction. Far up ahead the shouts were increasing in volume, spontaneously organizing into a concerted reiterated cry; a single, magic word that drove the multitude into a frenzy.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Do you know what is going on?" said Demetrius. &lt;/i&gt;[He was talking to another slave.]

&lt;i&gt;"Theyre yelling something about a king. Thats all I can make of it."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"You think theyve got somebody up front who wants to be their king? Is that it?"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Looks like it. They keep howling another word that I dont know - Messiah. The mans name, maybe."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Standing on tiptoe for an instant in the swaying crowd, Demetrius caught a fleeting glimpse of the obvious center of interest, a brown-haired, bareheaded, well-favored Jew. A tight little circle had been left open for the slow advance of the shaggy white donkey on which he rode. . . . There had been no effort to bedeck the pretender with any royal regalia. He was clad in a simple brown mantle with no decorations of any kind, and the handful of men - his intimate friends, no doubt - who tried to shield him from the pressure of the throng, wore the commonest sort of country garb.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It was quite clear now to Demetrius that the incident was accidental. . . . Whoever had started this wild pandemonium, it was apparent that it lacked the heros approbation.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The face of the enigmatic Jew seemed weighted with an almost insupportable burden of anxiety. The eyes, narrowed as if in resigned acceptance of some inevitable catastrophe, stared straight ahead toward Jerusalem.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Gradually the brooding eyes moved over the crowd until they came to rest on the strained, bewildered face of Demetrius. Perhaps, he wondered, the mans gaze halted there because he alone - in all this welter of hysteria - refrained from shouting. His silence singled him out. The eyes calmly appraised Demetrius. They neither widened nor smiled; but, in some indefinable manner, they held Demetrius in a grip so firm it was almost a physical compulsion. The message they communicated was something other than sympathy, something more vital than friendly concern; a sort of stabilizing power that swept away all such negations as slavery, poverty, or any other afflicting circumstance. Demetrius was suffused with the glow of this curious kinship. Blind with sudden tears, he elbowed through the throng and reached the roadside. The uncouth Athenian, bursting with curiosity, inopportunely accosted him.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"See him - close up?" he asked.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Demetrius nodded.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Crazy?" persisted the Athenian.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"No."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"King?"&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"No," muttered Demetrius, soberly - "not a king."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"What is he, then?" demanded the Athenian.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"I dont know," mumbled Demetrius, in a puzzled voice, "but - he is something more important than a king."&lt;/i&gt; [Lloyd C. Douglas, &lt;i&gt;The Robe, &lt;/i&gt;chapter 4]

I wish you a happy Christmas.

&lt;i&gt;Joy to the world, the Lord is come.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Let earth receive her King.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Let every heart prepare him room,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And heaven and nature sing.&lt;/i&gt;

God bless us all that we, may have a wholesome, hallowed, gracious, special time. I bear witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he lives, that he governs, that he inspires and directs, that he will come again. God help us to worship in all the wonderful ways there are this season. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Its an honor to be here. Although my present competence is geared more to a first-position version of "Flow Gently, Sweet Afton," my years with the violin so long ago perhaps qualify me to express deep gratitude and some appreciation for that magnificent music. I am thankful.</p>
<p>It had occurred to me that I might talk today about a subject such as voluntary compliance with established standards, but I drove here on the freeway. I think I wont discuss that subject today. Instead, Id like to talk to you about the season. I am aware that examinations are dead ahead and would hope that in some marvelous way the alchemy of this special time of year might dissuade us temporarily from contemplating them and permit us to join together in consideration of this wonderful holy day season, which I love. I love its sights, its sounds, its scents, the thoughts and feelings that it inspires, its songs, its sentiments. I love the tenderness it evokes, the gratitude and generosity, the sensitivity to thanks and to giving, its acts of kindness and of love, the effect on family. I love what it does to release friendliness and goodwill between one man and another, which most of us keep under pretty rigid control the rest of the year. There are occasions, of course, when those carefully reserved feelings come forth naturally and spontaneously, as, for instance, when were caught under an awning in a downpour, or waiting behind a snowplow, or joined together in distress or action in the face of some calamity or personal difficulty. But of all these occasions, Christmas seems to be chief among those which bring out from good men, and maybe some of us less than good, those repressed emotions of brotherliness and kindliness.</p>
<p>I love the Christmas season. I love its spirit and its memories. It was at Christmas long ago that a tiny girl nestled snugly in my arms in the middle of the night and sighed with relief. She had been upchucking, perhaps from a slight overdose of excitement and anticipation, mixed with the seasons largess of goodies. "Daddy," she said, "for a while I was afraid I was going to lose the Christmas spirit."</p>
<p>And I love to remember the little hand on my knee as we rode through soft flakes of snow to our grandmothers on Christmas morning. We had been singing with the carolers on the radio when she said, "What does it mean to adore him?"</p>
<p>I worked at an answer, but every attempt engendered more questions and further efforts to explain until finally, compassionately, she laid that little hand on my knee and said, "I guess to adore him just means to love him."</p>
<p>Well, I come this morning with three themes, or one theme and two variations, to express briefly my love for the season. The theme is centered in a few words in a very familiar song, much like the one we sang together. These are the words. Have you heard them as well as sung them?</p>
<p><i>Joy to the world, the Lord is come.</i><br />
<i>Let earth receive her King.</i><br />
<i>Let every heart prepare him room,</i><br />
<i>And heaven and nature sing.</i></p>
<p>Seven hundred years before he came, Isaiah sang a sweet psalm of his coming:</p>
<p><i>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</i> [Isaiah 9:2, 6]</p>
<p>His advent, of course, had been long anticipated. In Gods plan there was place and need for a sacrifice, an atoning sacrifice for sin. And so he came in due season, not as man anticipated but as God directed. There wasnt any pomp; there were no blaring trumpets, no parade or ceremony, no army, no array of great ones ushering in the King. There was a crowded inn, a manger, a mother and a baby, some shepherds, and some wise men, unconscious of their different stations. There were angels and a message for those who had ears to hear.</p>
<p><i>They were all looking for a king</i><br />
<i>To set them free and lift them high;</i><br />
<i>Thou earnest, a little baby thing</i><br />
<i>To make a woman cry.</i><br />
[Author unknown]</p>
<p>He grew, served, taught, learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and did, as he had been sent to do, the will of his Father.</p>
<p>When the appointed time came he was accused, mocked, arrayed in a purple robe. They platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head. They smote him with a reed and took him to be crucified. He was lifted up upon the cross by man that he might, as he said, "draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil" (3 Nephi 27:14).</p>
<p>On the cross he comforted those who suffered with him, he invoked the forgiveness of his Father for those who took his life, and in anguish he cried out to the God whose face for the moment may have been turned away from the awful scene - who knows, perhaps to wipe a tear. "Truly this was the Son of God," said the centurion (Matthew 27:54). He rose, as we know, at the appointed time from the tomb in which he had been tenderly laid - the first that should rise. Resurrected, he companied for many days with his apostles and others, ascended to heaven as they watched him, visited his people in the American hemisphere and taught them, appeared to Paul and to Stephen, and in the last dispensation, with his Father, revealed himself to a boy prophet. As he promised, he will come again. For all of that I give thanks. I bear testimony that it is true. He will come again.</p>
<h2><b>A Thanksgiving Time</b></h2>
<p>My first variation on the theme then, is thanksgiving, the second, and briefest part of this message. Christmas - and every other important holiday, it occurs to me - is a thanksgiving time: to mothers, to the founders of our country and the fathers of our free society, to those who have offered their lives to keep it free, to our loved ones departed, and at Christmas (always and every day, of course, but especially at Christmas) to God our Father and his holy Son, Jesus Christ. The past year has been full of perplexing problems; the possibilities ahead are certainly sobering in prospect. Yet the Christmas season brings to our hearts the spirit of thanks and of giving.</p>
<h2><b>Wholesome, Hallowed, Gracious</b></h2>
<p>With Christ and gratitude and giving in our minds, then let me share with you the third part, or the second variation. It comes from another source, from another time. From Hamlet we read:</p>
<p><i>Some say that ever gainst that season comes</i><br />
<i>Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated,</i><br />
<i>This bird of dawning singeth all night long;</i><br />
<i>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,</i><br />
<i>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</i><br />
<i>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</i><br />
<i>So hallowed and so gracious is that time.</i><br />
[Hamlet, 1.i.15864]</p>
<p><i>Wholesome, hallowed, gracious</i> - what wonderful words. I love them. They represent to me all that Christmas and the season may mean. Think of them with me for a moment.</p>
<p>How to make the season <i>wholesome? </i>Why, by glancing healthfully inward for a moment. By seeking to bring ourselves more nearly to that measure of wholeness, of integrity, of unity with loftiest desires, of congruence with richest spiritual feeling, of harmony with that person that I would fondly like to be.</p>
<h2>Wholesome: the Master of Christmas</h2>
<p>Many years ago a great man who taught at this university gave us a vision of the importance of that harmony. When I graduated from high school I wanted to come to Brigham Young University, with his name and face and strengths in mind. I really had in mind Harrison R. Merrill and BYU, in that order. If you know it well, rejoice with me; if not, be introduced to one of his greatest poems. He called it "Christmas Eve on the Desert."</p>
<p><i>Tonight, not one alone am I, but three - </i><br />
<i>The Lad I was, the Man I am, and he</i><br />
<i>Who looks adown the coming future years</i><br />
<i>And wonders at my sloth. His hopes and fears</i><br />
<i>Should goad me to the manly game</i><br />
<i>Of adding to the honor of my name.</i><br />
<i>Im Fate to him - that chap thats I, grown old.</i><br />
<i>No matter how much stocks and land and gold</i><br />
<i>I save for him, he cant buy back a single day</i><br />
<i>On which I built a pattern for his way.</i></p>
<p><i>I, in turn, am product of that Boy</i><br />
<i>Who rarely thought of After Selves. His joy</i><br />
<i>Was in the present. He might have saved me woe </i><br />
<i>Had he but thought. The ways that I must go</i><br />
<i>Are his. He marked them all for me.</i><br />
<i>And I must follow - and so must he - </i><br />
<i>My Future Self - Unless I save him!</i><br />
<i>Save? - Somehow that word,</i><br />
<i>Deep down, a precious thought has stirred</i><br />
<i>Savior? - Yes, Im savior to that "Me."</i><br />
<i>That thoughtful After Person whom I see! - </i><br />
<i>The thought is staggering! I sit and gaze</i><br />
<i>At my two Other Selves, joint keepers of my days!</i></p>
<p><i>Master of Christmas, You dared to bleed and die</i><br />
<i>That others might find life. How much more I</i><br />
<i>Should willingly give up my present days</i><br />
<i>To lofty deeds; seek out the ways</i><br />
<i>To build a splendid life. I should not fail</i><br />
<i>To set my feet upon the star-bound trail</i><br />
<i>For him - that After Self. You said that he</i><br />
<i>Whod lose his life should find it, and I know</i><br />
<i>You found a larger life, still live and grow.</i><br />
<i>Your doctrine was, so Ive been told, serve man.</i><br />
<i>I wonder if Im doing all I can</i><br />
<i>To serve? Will serving help that Older Me</i><br />
<i>To be the man hed fondly like to be?</i></p>
<p><i>Last night I passed a shack</i><br />
<i>Where hunger lurked. I must go back</i><br />
<i>And take a lamb, Is that the message of the Star</i><br />
<i>Whose rays, please God, can shine this far?</i></p>
<p><i>Tonight, not one alone am I, but three - </i><br />
<i>The Lad I was, the Man I am, and he</i><br />
<i>Who is my Future Self - nay, more:</i><br />
<i>I am His savior - that thought makes me four!</i></p>
<p><i>Master of Christmas, that Star of Thine shines clear - </i><br />
<i>Bless Thou the four of me - out here!</i><br />
<i>Wholesome, hallowed, gracious.</i></p>
<p>The angelic message was "Peace on earth, goodwill to men." We do not despair of peace; yet we know something of history and something of the scriptures and something of present complexities, and we know that no one of us nor all of us here together can govern the world of men and their decisions. There is something we can do about peace in our lives and peace between us and our families and our neighbors - something - but we cannot control an insatiable world and the decisions of many men. But goodwill to men, what of that? Many of you are already experts in that adventure, but perhaps others have yet to learn that goodwill, like love, is more than language.</p>
<p>Do you know the words of Millay?</p>
<p><i>Love is not all; it is not meat nor drink,</i><br />
<i>Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;</i><br />
<i>Nor yet a floating spar to men who sink.</i><br />
[Edna St. Vincent Millay]</p>
<p>God so loved that he gave. Christ so loved that he gave. What of us? I remember the impressive words of Bonhoeffer, who said of Jesus that he was a man for others; and the words of Luther, who in his great speech on good works talked of Mary, who, having heard the announcement, went about her life preparing, not retired from the active scene because she had such knowledge, but involved in giving and growing and preparing.</p>
<h2>Gracious: Brotherly Love and Giving</h2>
<p>For <i>graciousness, </i>how do you like the marvelous, simple story of the little boy who saw the bright, new automobile and said to its owner, walking about it on Christmas Eve:</p>
<p><i>"Is that your car, Mister?"</i></p>
<p><i>The man nodded. "My brother gave it to me for Christmas."</i></p>
<p><i>The boy looked astounded. "You mean your brother gave it to you and it didnt cost you nothing? Gosh, I wish - " He hesitated, and the man knew what he was going to wish. He was going to wish that he had a brother like that. But what the lad said jarred him all the way down to his heels. "I wish," the boy went on, "that I could be a brother like that."</i></p>
<p><i>Paul looked at the boy in astonishment. Then impulsively he said, "Would you like a ride in my automobile?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Yes," said the little boy.</i></p>
<p><i>After a short ride, the youngster, his eyes aglow, said, "Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?" Paul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the lad wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile. But he was wrong again. "Will you stop by those two steps?" the boy asked. He ran up the steps. In a little while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little polio-crippled brother. He sat him down on the bottom step, sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car. "There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother give it to him for Christmas and it didnt cost him a cent. And some day Im going to give you one just like it. Then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that Ive been trying to tell you about."</i></p>
<p><i>Paul got out and lifted the little lad to the front seat of his car. The shiny-eyed older brother climbed in beside him, and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride.</i></p>
<p><i>That Christmas Eve Paul learned what Jesus meant about brotherliness and giving.</i> [C. Roy Angell, in <i>Guideposts</i>]</p>
<p>And if I may add it, Id like to tell you another thing I love very much about Christmas. I love to remember what the scripture says, and perhaps you are well aware of it: "Let brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares" (Hebrews 13:12).</p>
<p>There was a night when we had the blessing of having in our home a stranger, sorely afflicted. After all these years I have some hesitance to mention the incident, lest anyone know or connect her with it. She was from far away. She was away from her family. She had been incarcerated in institutions, had been released to go to her parents in another state, also far away, but after months of little progression and apparently with little hope in sight, had been relieved of her restraints there. Having affiliation with the Church, she found her way to Salt Lake City, to Temple Square, which she thought to be the heart of the Church, and sat across the desk from me, hopeless, her eyes blank, talking about her children, talking intermittently also about the voices she heard. She was ill. There was no appropriate place to send her, so we took her home.</p>
<p>Our holiday season was impaired a bit, as I now impair the memory by the repetition. That didnt matter much. We missed a few parties; we felt someone should be with her, because she was obviously seriously ill. We didnt know the therapy; we knew how to pray to God, and she joined us with our then very little family. The days went by. Christmas arrived. That morning she arose with us. She sat in a chair and watched as the presents were given and received. For everyone received by anyone else, she also received a gift. I fancied I saw the curtain going up a little. I watched a tear come trickling, and then, without premeditation and certainly without instruction, a little girl climbed onto her knee, put her arms around her neck, and said, "Susannah, I love you." And the tears gushed and the curtain rose and the humanity came through. She wept, then talked freely about her little ones, about her husband at home, about her problems.</p>
<p>A little later I made a telephone call. I spoke to a man who was agonizing through the day. He didnt want her away, but her illness had made it improbable to have her home. I talked with him of her present circumstance. He said, "Is there any way to get her home?" We found a way. There was an airplane and gracious people who made way, and a lady who got nervously aboard and soon thereafter arrived home to the arms of her own loved ones. She wrote us regularly for many years to thank us for a simple gift of brotherliness at a special time.</p>
<h2>More Important than a King</h2>
<p>Oh, I love the words <i>wholesome, hallowed, gracious. </i>Among the many wonderful things I would like to remind you about, I love and will conclude with a brief statement from a great book written long ago. It is about a slave who lived in Christs time and watched him on a certain special Sunday in the midst of a multitude.</p>
<p><i>Suddenly, for no reason at all that Demetrius could observe, there was a wave of excitement. It swept down over the sluggish swollen stream of zealots like a sharp breeze. Men all about him were breaking loose from their families, tossing their packs into the arms of their overburdened children, and racing forward toward some urgent attraction. Far up ahead the shouts were increasing in volume, spontaneously organizing into a concerted reiterated cry; a single, magic word that drove the multitude into a frenzy.</i></p>
<p><i>"Do you know what is going on?" said Demetrius. </i>[He was talking to another slave.]</p>
<p><i>"Theyre yelling something about a king. Thats all I can make of it."</i></p>
<p><i>"You think theyve got somebody up front who wants to be their king? Is that it?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Looks like it. They keep howling another word that I dont know - Messiah. The mans name, maybe."</i></p>
<p><i>Standing on tiptoe for an instant in the swaying crowd, Demetrius caught a fleeting glimpse of the obvious center of interest, a brown-haired, bareheaded, well-favored Jew. A tight little circle had been left open for the slow advance of the shaggy white donkey on which he rode. . . . There had been no effort to bedeck the pretender with any royal regalia. He was clad in a simple brown mantle with no decorations of any kind, and the handful of men - his intimate friends, no doubt - who tried to shield him from the pressure of the throng, wore the commonest sort of country garb.</i></p>
<p><i>It was quite clear now to Demetrius that the incident was accidental. . . . Whoever had started this wild pandemonium, it was apparent that it lacked the heros approbation.</i></p>
<p><i>The face of the enigmatic Jew seemed weighted with an almost insupportable burden of anxiety. The eyes, narrowed as if in resigned acceptance of some inevitable catastrophe, stared straight ahead toward Jerusalem.</i></p>
<p><i>Gradually the brooding eyes moved over the crowd until they came to rest on the strained, bewildered face of Demetrius. Perhaps, he wondered, the mans gaze halted there because he alone - in all this welter of hysteria - refrained from shouting. His silence singled him out. The eyes calmly appraised Demetrius. They neither widened nor smiled; but, in some indefinable manner, they held Demetrius in a grip so firm it was almost a physical compulsion. The message they communicated was something other than sympathy, something more vital than friendly concern; a sort of stabilizing power that swept away all such negations as slavery, poverty, or any other afflicting circumstance. Demetrius was suffused with the glow of this curious kinship. Blind with sudden tears, he elbowed through the throng and reached the roadside. The uncouth Athenian, bursting with curiosity, inopportunely accosted him.</i></p>
<p><i>"See him - close up?" he asked.</i></p>
<p><i>Demetrius nodded.</i></p>
<p><i>"Crazy?" persisted the Athenian.</i></p>
<p><i>"No."</i></p>
<p><i>"King?"</i></p>
<p><i>"No," muttered Demetrius, soberly - "not a king."</i></p>
<p><i>"What is he, then?" demanded the Athenian.</i></p>
<p><i>"I dont know," mumbled Demetrius, in a puzzled voice, "but - he is something more important than a king."</i> [Lloyd C. Douglas, <i>The Robe, </i>chapter 4]</p>
<p>I wish you a happy Christmas.</p>
<p><i>Joy to the world, the Lord is come.</i><br />
<i>Let earth receive her King.</i><br />
<i>Let every heart prepare him room,</i><br />
<i>And heaven and nature sing.</i></p>
<p>God bless us all that we, may have a wholesome, hallowed, gracious, special time. I bear witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he lives, that he governs, that he inspires and directs, that he will come again. God help us to worship in all the wonderful ways there are this season. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful to be with you on this cold December morning. I pray that the warmth of the Spirit will bless us that we might be edified during our few moments together.
Today I want to talk with you about the greatest story ever told - and one of its less obvious but most important themes. You could probably recite much of this story by heart. It occupies little more than a page of scripture. It begins with the familiar duty of paying taxes. It continues with a journey that was not unusual for the time. The plot thickens when no room can be found "in the inns";1 it culminates when the Son of God is born of Mary, "a precious and chosen" virgin.2
We know little about the real people and few details regarding the true events. And yet, no matter how many times we read the story of the first Christmas, there always seems to be something new we can learn from it. That is because, as prophets have taught, "the word of God is quick," or living.3 It takes on fresh and deeper meaning whenever we are spiritually ready to receive it.
Something that stands out to me in the account of the Saviors birth is that on four separate occasions an angel appeared with the message "Fear not."
When the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias with news that his wife would bear a son, the forerunner of the Messiah, he said, "Fear not, . . . for thy prayer is heard."4
Later the same angel visited "beautiful and fair"5 Mary to tell her that she would be the mother of the Son of God, assuring her with similar words: "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."6
Shortly thereafter an angel appeared to Joseph the carpenter in a dream and said, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife."7
And then, on that holy night, as all eternity watched in reverent silence, the angel came upon humble shepherds keeping watch over their flock. The shepherds, who "were sore afraid,"8 heard the angel proclaim, "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."9
So much of what happened during those pivotal moments in the nativity narrative depended upon the courage of people like Zacharias, Mary, Joseph, and the shepherds. God had a monumental task for each of them; their lives were about to change forever. Imagine if they had let fear overcome them. What if they had pulled back, doubted, and failed to do what God needed them to do?
This less obvious theme from the account of the first Christmas intrigues me because I, like you, have fears, and I need to be reminded at times to fear not. I dont know what your fears are. Like Zacharias, who feared that he would never have children, you may have fears about your family. Or maybe your fear isnt that you wont have children but that you will have children, whom you will have to r</span>

So, in conclusion, I love Christmas and I love BYU devotionals. I am grateful to be with you, and my older siblings, graduates of BYU, are here, having traveled from Arizona and Idaho. They must have thought I was graduating today. Im not saying my older siblings are old, but there were no history classes on campus when they attended, just current events. The deodorant Old Spice was then known as New Spice, and the Dead Sea was just mildly sick.
Since my academic focus is education law, and since much of that discipline and practice is focused on protecting the rights and persons of children, Id like to discuss what it means in the perfect economy of the Lords kingdom to become as a little child. I believe Christmas and the birth of the Christ child help us explore this concept.
Becoming as a Little Child
When our Heavenly Father wanted to save the world, He didnt take over a country or develop a militia. He sent a helpless child to a choice and worthy woman and a humble and believing man living in insecure circumstances in a conquered land occupied by a hostile force. The harsh geopolitical and military circumstances of Christs birth should remind us that Heavenly Father can bless us even if the external circumstances of our lives arent necessarily easy or peaceful.
Herod the Great ruled over that land, under Romes ultimate control. He was mighty and built magnificent monuments - at least one of which overshadowed the land when Christ was born, being visible in all directions for miles. We cant help but contrast Herods mighty palace with the stable. If we knew for sure where the stable was, wouldnt we wish to visit the site of that sacred birth? But who cares as much about anything Herod built, besides perhaps one or two of our learned faculty members? Most of us with a normal threshold for boredom ignore Herod.
Christ is infinitely more important. We seek Christs words and probably have many of His words memorized. Well, not everyone does apparently, because Im always surprised on Jeopardy when those brainiacs often seem to know nothing about the scriptures. We Mormons, in turn, are continually lost on the "Potent Potables" category. We celebrate and rejoice in the words and the happenings of Christs birth. Does anyone, even the most bookishly versant among us, celebrate the words or circumstances of Herod and his birth?
The New Testament shows us something of the Christ child we celebrate at Christmas in the perfect young adult He has become. He hasnt become full of Himself and self-important, careworn, and brusque. Although Isaiah described Him as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted wi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Beloved students, faculty, and friends of Brigham Young University, you are a marvelous sight, and Susan and I are honored and full of gratitude to be with you today. We always feel tender feelings when we return to Brigham Young University, as this is where we met and were engaged. We met in a religion class called Your Religious Problems. I have forgotten many of the details of the class, but I do know that whatever my religious problem was, she solved it, and whatever her problem was, well, I hope I solved it too.
In a very short while your final exams will end and you will return to family or friends for Christmas. In view of the approaching Yuletide season, I have chosen to share with you today a Christmas message, a message of hope and glad tidings, even my assurance and witness of the birth, life, and eternal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
More than 700 years before his birth, Isaiah prophesied of Christ in words memorialized by George Frideric Handel in the Messiah oratorio:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. [Isaiah 9:6]
In this one concise sentence, Isaiah foretold Christs birth; His Second Coming; His millennial reign; and His eternal mission as the mighty God and Father of our salvation.
Handels Messiah also brought to glorious musical life the following admonition, based on Isaiah:
O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, . . . O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! [Handel, "O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion," Messiah; see Isaiah 40:9]
Brothers and sisters, join with me and behold your God! Behold your God, born as a little child in Bethlehem and wrapped in swaddling clothes. Behold your God, born in poverty and simplicity that He might walk among common people as a common man. Behold your God, even the infinite and eternal Redeemer, the Messiah, veiled in flesh and come to live upon the very earth that He created.
Return with me to that sacred first Christmas in Bethlehem to contemplate the birth of our Lord. He came in the quiet of the night, in the meridian of time, He who was Immanuel, the Rod of Jesse, the Dayspring, the Key of David, the very Lord of Might. His birth marked the promised visitation of the Creator to earth, the condescension of God to man. As Isaiah wrote of the event:
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. [Isaiah 9:2]
We know from modern revelation that Jesus was born on April 6, making it springtime in Judea when the anointed King of Israel came to earth. As Micah had prophes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">With Christmas only a fortnight away, thoughts turn to our homes and families. Sister Nelson and I enjoy many Christmas traditions. On our mantle over the fireplace we display a small framed photograph of each member of the family. With 10 children, their spouses, and 54 grandchildren, thats quite a flock of photos. We have been doing this for so long that most of the pictures are no longer current. The children scramble to find their own pictures among the many.
They also admire Sister Nelsons large assortment of dolls collected from various countries throughout the world. Those dolls are nestled among the branches of our Christmas tree. Her cookies, cakes, and candies are always in great demand. And we love to read scriptures of the Christmas story with our family.
Through all of our various Christmas traditions, I hope that we are focused first upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men still adore Him. At this special devotional, many of you have come with a prayer in your hearts that you may learn from one of the Twelve Apostles more about our Lord and Master.
We commemorate His humble birth at this time of year, even though we know it did not occur in December but more likely in April. Scriptures declare that His mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph. They had participated in the first of two components of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Their espousal might be likened to an engagement in our culture, which is followed later by the second component of a marriage ceremony.
Lukes account records the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mary when she first learned of her favored future. I read from chapter 1:
"Hail, thou that art highly favoured . . . : blessed art thou among women. . . .
"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest."1 (Note the capital S; capital H.)
God is the Highest. Jesus was to be the Son of the Highest.
"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"2
She knew of her virginal status.
