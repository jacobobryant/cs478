  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a great honor to be on this beautiful campus, which is new by the standards of universities throughout the world, on this special occasion. It is to your great credit that you seek each week to reexamine your spiritual values and their importance in your lives.

I have chosen to speak to you today on the subject of “Christianity—repression or liberation?”

For the past decade, students have been doing what they have been doing for centuries, examining and challenging their values. During the past ten years, it has been done, however, with greater fervor. Repression and liberation have been dominant themes, both religiously and politically. Many have felt that their campuses were too repressive and sought to take over the government of the university, even though they contributed very little to its building and maintenance costs. Some have misunderstood what liberation means. Henry Ward Beecher said, “There is no liberty to men whose passions are stronger than their religious beliefs: there is no liberty to men in whom ignorance predominates over knowledge. There is no liberty to men who know not how to govern themselves.”

Saying essentially the same thing was Henry Brooks Adams, who said, “Absolute liberty is absence of restraint. Responsibility is restraint and therefore the ideally free individual is responsible to himself.” Therefore, I wish to speak of repression and liberation in terms of the individual.

Too many, in the past few years, have been intent upon seeking and claiming rights, rather than respecting them. They have ignored the fact that with every right there is a duty. Mohandas Gandhi was quick to say, “I am a lover of my own liberty and so I would do nothing to restrict yours.”

You young people at this University should all have frontiers, but to pursue those frontiers, you must exercise restraint. Liberation is, in the words of David Lloyd George, “not merely a privilege to be conferred. It is a habit to be acquired.”

Harry Emerson Fosdick, speaking of your generation, said:

&lt;i&gt;Many of them are brought up to think that goodness means repression. All through their maturing youth, they keep coming upon new powers, new passions, new ambitions, and they are told that these must be repressed. At first they docilely accept the negative idea. They try to be good by saying “no” to their surging life, and some day they grow so utterly weary of this same negative repressive goodness that they can tolerate it no longer and they start out to be free, wild and self-indulgent, only to find the road, not to freedom, but to slavery, with habits that bind them and diseases that curse them and blasted reputations that ruin them. Would not Jesus say to them, some such thing as this, “You have made a bad mistake. Goodness is not mainly repression. It is finding your real self and then having it set free. It is positively living for those things which alone are worth living for. It is expression. The effulgence of life into its full power and its abundant fruitage. I come that ye might have life and that ye might have it abundantly.” That is real Christianity as it is the spirit of Jesus. Some Christians carry their religion on their backs. It is a packet of beliefs and practices they must bear. At times it grows heavy and they would be willing to lay it down, but that would mean a break with old traditions, so they shoulder it again. But real Christians do not carry their religion, their religion carries them. It is not weight, it is wings. It lifts them up. It sees them over hard places. It makes the universe seem friendly, life purposeful, hope real, sacrifice worthwhile. It sets them free from fear, futility, discouragement and sin—the great enslavers of men’s souls. You can know a real Christian when you see him by his buoyancy&lt;/i&gt;.

It was Alexis de Tocqueville who said, “Christianity is the companion of liberty and all its conflicts. The cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims.”

Among those who are having difficulty finding their appropriate degree of liberation in the world are women. Eliza R. Snow, in 1872 made a timeless statement on this subject. She said:

&lt;i&gt;The status of women is one of the questions of the day. Some are so conservative that they oppose every change until they are compelled to accept it. They refuse to concede that woman is entitled to the enjoyment of any rights, other than those which the whims, fancies or justice, as the case may be, of men, may choose to grant her. Others again not only recognize that woman’s status should be improved, but are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, assume for her a separate and opposing existence, and to show how entirely independent she should be, would make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women. We are all our own self-destruct mechanism.&lt;/i&gt;

Helen Keller was born with many repressive handicaps. She was, as a young child, almost as if she were a wild beast, unreasoning, ruled only be her passions. Until her teacher could get her to begin to learn, to listen, no progress could be made. Richard L. Evans said:

&lt;i&gt;Those who break windows to let in fresh air, do not love fresh air, as much as the sound of tinkling glass. Freedom which Christianity affords is a freedom to soar above the sordid, the mundane. “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint.” (Isaiah 40:31)&lt;/i&gt;

The great energizer of the true Christian, the battery which generates the starter of our inner strengthening motors, is prayer. Dr. Alexis Carrel, celebrated physician, examined the effect of prayer from a physiological standpoint. Said he:

&lt;i&gt;Prayer is not only worship, it is also an invisible emanation of man’s worshiping spirit, the most powerful form of energy that one can generate. The influence of prayer on the human mind and body is as demonstrable as that of secreting glands. Its results can be measured in terms of increased physical buoyancy, great intellectual vigor, moral stamina and a deeper understanding of the realities underlying human relationships. If you make a habit of sincere prayer, your life will be very noticeably and profoundly altered. Prayer stamps with its indelible mark our actions and demeanor, a tranquility of bearing. A facial and bodily repose are observed in those whose inner lives are thus enriched. Within the depths of consciousness, a flame kindles, a man sees himself. He discovers his selfishness, his silly pride, his fears, his greed, his moral obligation, intellectual humility. Thus begins the journey of the soul towards the realm of grace.&lt;/i&gt;

There are in the scriptures a few especially choice statements of man’s duty. May I suggest three:

&lt;i&gt;If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.&lt;/i&gt; [James 1:26–27]

&lt;i&gt;What doth the the lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?&lt;/i&gt; [Micah 6:8]

&lt;i&gt;Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.&lt;/i&gt; [Ecclesiastes 12:13]

From beyond the pages of the Bible, from the pen of Bonaventure comes the suggestion, “The best perfection of a religious man is to do common things in a perfect manner.” The simple tragedy is that, with a loss of faith in religion, people often lose faith in themselves.

It has been my great blessing to know three perfect women. I speak of my wife, my mother, and my mother-in-law. I would like to tell you of my mother-in-law. Many a man seeks to disparage his wife’s mother (Lord Rulles said the penalty for bigamy was having two mothers-in-law); I seek to venerate mine. Her name was Elizabeth Hamilton Wright. She was a twin, born into a family of fourteen children. Because she was gifted in dealing with children, she was taken out of school after the third grade and given the necessary task of tending the younger children. It used to pull my heartstrings out to watch her laboriously write a letter. But she was liberated and fully emancipated, because she had graduated &lt;i&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/i&gt; in spirituality. She knew things beyond the understanding of those of us who were merely trained. She knew them by the Spirit of God. She was the humblest of the humble, the wisest of the wise, because she was simple enough to be able to accept a complete belief in God. She knew that the best religion is humanity and the best divine service is to love thy neighbor as thyself. She literally loved her neighbors beyond her love for herself. It is my belief that her daughter, Ruth, surpasses even her mother.

One wise man, Johann Kaspar Lavater, has said, “All belief that does not render us more happy, more free, more loving, more active, more calm, is, I fear, an erroneous and superstitious belief.”

The subject of our discussion today, “Christianity—Repression or Liberation?” would seem also in a measure to apply to governments. A shrewd observer, Niccolo Machiavelli, declared:

&lt;i&gt;And as the strict observance of religious worship is the cause why states rise to eminence, so contempt for religion brings ruin on them. For where the fear of God is wanting, destruction is sure to follow, or else it must be sustained by the fear felt for their prince, who may thus supply the want of religion in his subjects. Whence it arises that the kingdoms that depend only on the virtue of a mortal, have a short duration. It is seldom that the virtue of the father survives the son.&lt;/i&gt;

Being thoughtful students, you are all aware of the cynical statement of Karl Marx, “Religion is the sign of the oppressed creature. The feeling of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of unspiritual conditions. It is the opium of the people.” Rather than being like a drug, these gifts of the Spirit work differently. They do not excite; they calm. They do not hallucinate; they strengthen. They do not weaken, but make more powerful. They are not mere escape hatches from responsibilities, but instruments of insight into what life really means. The spiritually liberating life proves itself by moral responsibility, by an awareness of human fallibility, yet reserves, indeed teaches, the ultimate majesty and meaning of life. It is that which spans our horizons, our feelings, our senses, rather than limiting and inhibiting them. It is the learning of the vast difference between saying prayers and praying. Our prayers, like lightning, go into the unseen, and the responses that we receive give us the safest course that can be found.

This great unique University, maintained in a large measure by the tithing of those who are not affluent but are faithful, by the widow’s mite, is founded and maintained on the premise that pure Christianity is not repressive, but is the most liberating to the human soul of all of the forces at work in the world.

Your great President, for whom I have such great respect, when he talks to you about the standards of how you look, is trying to tell you that how you look will affect how you think and act. He looks to the future. He wishes that when you walk down the street, that when you sit in councils, that when you speak, people will marvel and say that you are truly a liberated person—free of groveling, debasing, and confining, feelings, thoughts, and passions being merchandised in the finite world. We hope it will be said of you with awe and respect, “This person has so much wisdom and grace, he or she has found the ultimate of all truths—the redeeming power of Christ.”

We hope that you will reach for the finite. I pray that you will, in addition to the great teachers at this University, be under the personal tutelage of the Savior. I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>It is a great honor to be on this beautiful campus, which is new by the standards of universities throughout the world, on this special occasion. It is to your great credit that you seek each week to reexamine your spiritual values and their importance in your lives.</p>
<p>I have chosen to speak to you today on the subject of “Christianity—repression or liberation?”</p>
<p>For the past decade, students have been doing what they have been doing for centuries, examining and challenging their values. During the past ten years, it has been done, however, with greater fervor. Repression and liberation have been dominant themes, both religiously and politically. Many have felt that their campuses were too repressive and sought to take over the government of the university, even though they contributed very little to its building and maintenance costs. Some have misunderstood what liberation means. Henry Ward Beecher said, “There is no liberty to men whose passions are stronger than their religious beliefs: there is no liberty to men in whom ignorance predominates over knowledge. There is no liberty to men who know not how to govern themselves.”</p>
<p>Saying essentially the same thing was Henry Brooks Adams, who said, “Absolute liberty is absence of restraint. Responsibility is restraint and therefore the ideally free individual is responsible to himself.” Therefore, I wish to speak of repression and liberation in terms of the individual.</p>
<p>Too many, in the past few years, have been intent upon seeking and claiming rights, rather than respecting them. They have ignored the fact that with every right there is a duty. Mohandas Gandhi was quick to say, “I am a lover of my own liberty and so I would do nothing to restrict yours.”</p>
<p>You young people at this University should all have frontiers, but to pursue those frontiers, you must exercise restraint. Liberation is, in the words of David Lloyd George, “not merely a privilege to be conferred. It is a habit to be acquired.”</p>
<p>Harry Emerson Fosdick, speaking of your generation, said:</p>
<p><i>Many of them are brought up to think that goodness means repression. All through their maturing youth, they keep coming upon new powers, new passions, new ambitions, and they are told that these must be repressed. At first they docilely accept the negative idea. They try to be good by saying “no” to their surging life, and some day they grow so utterly weary of this same negative repressive goodness that they can tolerate it no longer and they start out to be free, wild and self-indulgent, only to find the road, not to freedom, but to slavery, with habits that bind them and diseases that curse them and blasted reputations that ruin them. Would not Jesus say to them, some such thing as this, “You have made a bad mistake. Goodness is not mainly repression. It is finding your real self and then having it set free. It is positively living for those things which alone are worth living for. It is expression. The effulgence of life into its full power and its abundant fruitage. I come that ye might have life and that ye might have it abundantly.” That is real Christianity as it is the spirit of Jesus. Some Christians carry their religion on their backs. It is a packet of beliefs and practices they must bear. At times it grows heavy and they would be willing to lay it down, but that would mean a break with old traditions, so they shoulder it again. But real Christians do not carry their religion, their religion carries them. It is not weight, it is wings. It lifts them up. It sees them over hard places. It makes the universe seem friendly, life purposeful, hope real, sacrifice worthwhile. It sets them free from fear, futility, discouragement and sin—the great enslavers of men’s souls. You can know a real Christian when you see him by his buoyancy</i>.</p>
<p>It was Alexis de Tocqueville who said, “Christianity is the companion of liberty and all its conflicts. The cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims.”</p>
<p>Among those who are having difficulty finding their appropriate degree of liberation in the world are women. Eliza R. Snow, in 1872 made a timeless statement on this subject. She said:</p>
<p><i>The status of women is one of the questions of the day. Some are so conservative that they oppose every change until they are compelled to accept it. They refuse to concede that woman is entitled to the enjoyment of any rights, other than those which the whims, fancies or justice, as the case may be, of men, may choose to grant her. Others again not only recognize that woman’s status should be improved, but are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, assume for her a separate and opposing existence, and to show how entirely independent she should be, would make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women. We are all our own self-destruct mechanism.</i></p>
<p>Helen Keller was born with many repressive handicaps. She was, as a young child, almost as if she were a wild beast, unreasoning, ruled only be her passions. Until her teacher could get her to begin to learn, to listen, no progress could be made. Richard L. Evans said:</p>
<p><i>Those who break windows to let in fresh air, do not love fresh air, as much as the sound of tinkling glass. Freedom which Christianity affords is a freedom to soar above the sordid, the mundane. “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint.” (Isaiah 40:31)</i></p>
<p>The great energizer of the true Christian, the battery which generates the starter of our inner strengthening motors, is prayer. Dr. Alexis Carrel, celebrated physician, examined the effect of prayer from a physiological standpoint. Said he:</p>
<p><i>Prayer is not only worship, it is also an invisible emanation of man’s worshiping spirit, the most powerful form of energy that one can generate. The influence of prayer on the human mind and body is as demonstrable as that of secreting glands. Its results can be measured in terms of increased physical buoyancy, great intellectual vigor, moral stamina and a deeper understanding of the realities underlying human relationships. If you make a habit of sincere prayer, your life will be very noticeably and profoundly altered. Prayer stamps with its indelible mark our actions and demeanor, a tranquility of bearing. A facial and bodily repose are observed in those whose inner lives are thus enriched. Within the depths of consciousness, a flame kindles, a man sees himself. He discovers his selfishness, his silly pride, his fears, his greed, his moral obligation, intellectual humility. Thus begins the journey of the soul towards the realm of grace.</i></p>
<p>There are in the scriptures a few especially choice statements of man’s duty. May I suggest three:</p>
<p><i>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</i></p>
<p><i>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</i> [James 1:26–27]</p>
<p><i>What doth the the lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</i> [Micah 6:8]</p>
<p><i>Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</i> [Ecclesiastes 12:13]</p>
<p>From beyond the pages of the Bible, from the pen of Bonaventure comes the suggestion, “The best perfection of a religious man is to do common things in a perfect manner.” The simple tragedy is that, with a loss of faith in religion, people often lose faith in themselves.</p>
<p>It has been my great blessing to know three perfect women. I speak of my wife, my mother, and my mother-in-law. I would like to tell you of my mother-in-law. Many a man seeks to disparage his wife’s mother (Lord Rulles said the penalty for bigamy was having two mothers-in-law); I seek to venerate mine. Her name was Elizabeth Hamilton Wright. She was a twin, born into a family of fourteen children. Because she was gifted in dealing with children, she was taken out of school after the third grade and given the necessary task of tending the younger children. It used to pull my heartstrings out to watch her laboriously write a letter. But she was liberated and fully emancipated, because she had graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> in spirituality. She knew things beyond the understanding of those of us who were merely trained. She knew them by the Spirit of God. She was the humblest of the humble, the wisest of the wise, because she was simple enough to be able to accept a complete belief in God. She knew that the best religion is humanity and the best divine service is to love thy neighbor as thyself. She literally loved her neighbors beyond her love for herself. It is my belief that her daughter, Ruth, surpasses even her mother.</p>
<p>One wise man, Johann Kaspar Lavater, has said, “All belief that does not render us more happy, more free, more loving, more active, more calm, is, I fear, an erroneous and superstitious belief.”</p>
<p>The subject of our discussion today, “Christianity—Repression or Liberation?” would seem also in a measure to apply to governments. A shrewd observer, Niccolo Machiavelli, declared:</p>
<p><i>And as the strict observance of religious worship is the cause why states rise to eminence, so contempt for religion brings ruin on them. For where the fear of God is wanting, destruction is sure to follow, or else it must be sustained by the fear felt for their prince, who may thus supply the want of religion in his subjects. Whence it arises that the kingdoms that depend only on the virtue of a mortal, have a short duration. It is seldom that the virtue of the father survives the son.</i></p>
<p>Being thoughtful students, you are all aware of the cynical statement of Karl Marx, “Religion is the sign of the oppressed creature. The feeling of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of unspiritual conditions. It is the opium of the people.” Rather than being like a drug, these gifts of the Spirit work differently. They do not excite; they calm. They do not hallucinate; they strengthen. They do not weaken, but make more powerful. They are not mere escape hatches from responsibilities, but instruments of insight into what life really means. The spiritually liberating life proves itself by moral responsibility, by an awareness of human fallibility, yet reserves, indeed teaches, the ultimate majesty and meaning of life. It is that which spans our horizons, our feelings, our senses, rather than limiting and inhibiting them. It is the learning of the vast difference between saying prayers and praying. Our prayers, like lightning, go into the unseen, and the responses that we receive give us the safest course that can be found.</p>
<p>This great unique University, maintained in a large measure by the tithing of those who are not affluent but are faithful, by the widow’s mite, is founded and maintained on the premise that pure Christianity is not repressive, but is the most liberating to the human soul of all of the forces at work in the world.</p>
<p>Your great President, for whom I have such great respect, when he talks to you about the standards of how you look, is trying to tell you that how you look will affect how you think and act. He looks to the future. He wishes that when you walk down the street, that when you sit in councils, that when you speak, people will marvel and say that you are truly a liberated person—free of groveling, debasing, and confining, feelings, thoughts, and passions being merchandised in the finite world. We hope it will be said of you with awe and respect, “This person has so much wisdom and grace, he or she has found the ultimate of all truths—the redeeming power of Christ.”</p>
<p>We hope that you will reach for the finite. I pray that you will, in addition to the great teachers at this University, be under the personal tutelage of the Savior. I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I express my sincere gratitude and pleasure on receiving the degree of doctor of science and Christian service from Brigham Young University. I am not an alumnus of BYU. As I look back fifty-five years to when I visited the campus for the first time, I wish that I had received my undergraduate education at BYU. As I receive this distinguished degree, I join my wife and our two sons in having a degree from BYU.
I offer a few thoughts to the graduates as you embark on your life prepared by the degree from BYU that you will receive today.
Become a Scholar for Life
As I began my studies leading to the degree of doctor of medicine, the dean of the medical school met with the students. He said:
You are graduate students and are expected to learn on your own by your own effort. We will help you learn, but we will not spoon-feed you. We have a library of medicine. I would suggest that you go there, take a book from the shelves, read from it, and learn.
Today all of this information is available on the Internet, so it is easy to be studying and learning all of your life.
Resolve any conflict that you may have in your mind regarding scientifically based knowledge and knowledge that comes from the gifts of the Spirit. Remember the words of Isaiah:
Whom shall he teach knowledge? . . .
For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little. [Isaiah 28:9–10]
When one comes to the understanding that all knowledge has its origin with God and is given to man incrementally for the benefit of humankind, there is no conflict between science and gifts of the Spirit. We then qualify to receive new knowledge and recognize it rightfully as a gift from God.
Select Great Mentors and Follow Their Ways
On the first day of my training to become a heart surgeon with Dr. John W. Kirklin, one of the pioneers of the use of the heart-lung machine, he stated emphatically: “Try to do everything exactly as I do it!” At first I thought him to be arrogant, but as I considered more thoughtfully what he had said, I realized if I were ever to approach his excellence as a cardiac surgeon, it was incumbent upon me to follow his ways as accurately and precisely as possible.
President Russell M. Nelson, then Doctor Nelson, invited me to work with him in the practice of cardiovascular surgery. His environment was one in which honesty and doing what is right were the principles that guided all personal and professional relationships. Intellectual honesty means never leaving anything to chance. Intellectual dishonesty means thinking it will be okay when you know all is not right. Doing what is right means always taking the high road even if it is more difficult and less politically expedient.
Find Ways to Provide Christian Service
It has been easy for me as a medical </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I want to think with you today about what it means to be a Christian. And, since, ultimately, what it means to be a Christian is to “be perfect even as [Jesus], or [our] Father who is in heaven is perfect” (3 Nephi 12:48; see Matthew 5:48), I want to think with you about being a Christian perfectly, rather than doing Christianity perfectly. Perfection, we tell ourselves, is a process, but I want to take the Lord at His word, and His word when He issued this command is that we “be perfect” with no additional words of comforting qualification. The word be is an important word in this statement. To be perfect is to be complete, whole—though we mean to lose the self in the service of others so we can find it again. Our modern lives have a way of scattering us into the many sectors of our responsibilities, each with its own list of tasks to be performed, superiors to be satisfied, substances or situations to be avoided, and people to be loved. Something tells me that the wholeness the Lord is talking about is not the sum of the items on these lists, especially because the lists contain so many “to don’ts” as well as “to dos.”
One of the striking things about sin is that it is not an opposite form of completing the self but rather a way of dividing and dislocating a bit of oneself from the whole. We often refer to this phenomenon as compartmentalizing our lives and ourselves. I think that what we might call “Internet sin” is particularly effective in exploiting this vulnerability in us as well as in the world that we usually try to distinguish ourselves from. Certainly pornography, plagiarism, and gambling on the Internet are the problems they are for us because the chance to indulge the powerful temptations that have always been with us is now just a few clicks away. And it doesn’t help us that these temptations often find us, rather than our having to go out and look for them at a store, theater, or party.
But the basic challenge the Internet poses is that it’s more than just an easily accessible storehouse of images and information. The Web, with its many entrances into labyrinths of virtual experience and relationships, makes it easy for a part of oneself to wander off and slip into another room unnoticed by others and barely noticed by the rest of oneself. The appeal of restaging one’s life on another stage where it can enter in and exit from some contained adventure and stimulation is very strong, especially when one constitutes one’s world as a place of denials, deferrals, and dangers, and when envy of others’ worlds of popularity and possessions is inverted into configuring a good world as one that deprives its inhabitants of such things. Is that what we think righteousness is—a life of privation we endure on the promise that we’ll get more and better versions of the stuff and the station we’ve always wanted? If so, is it any wonder that when technology gives us the chance t</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">President and Sister Samuelson, my former colleagues at BYU, and friends, I am honored to speak to you today. Speakers at this podium have changed my life. I feel the burden of responsibility. I am thankful for the prayer and the inspirational music.
You should know that today is significant in the life of our family, not simply because I am speaking here but because it is also the 25th birthday of my son, Robert. Now you may think, “What a parochial thing to bring into a setting like this,” but historians will recognize that 25 years ago today something else very significant happened in the history of BYU. It was 25 years ago today that BYU beat UCLA in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament and Danny Ainge outscored the entire UCLA team in the first half. With hopes that this anniversary is a sign for good things to come for all BYU student athletes, I proceed.
One of the many enjoyable facets of my experience working at BYU was regular interaction with Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, whose responsibilities then included serving as commissioner of the Church Educational System. I remember him saying that he has learned from President Hinckley that we must do better at getting the gospel down into our own hearts and the hearts of those we love and serve. That is a challenge from the prophet. We must constantly ask ourselves how to meet that challenge. Today I offer a suggestion born of my recent experience as president of a BYU stake.
Years ago Elder Boyd K. Packer gave a general conference address titled “The Mediator.” In that address Elder Packer said:
[The Atonement of Christ] is the very root of Christian doctrine. You may know much about the gospel as it branches out from there, but if you only know the branches and those branches do not touch that root, if they have been cut free from that truth, there will be no life nor substance nor redemption in them. [Boyd K. Packer, “The Mediator,” Ensign, May 1977, 56]
I will confess to you that I have participated in—indeed, I have taught—many lessons that, although interesting and motivational, according to Elder Packer’s guide had “no life nor substance nor redemption in them” because they weren’t directly linked to the Atonement of Christ. That’s a serious criticism of much of what we do, and I believe it’s on the mark. I believe that one way—the best way, and possibly the only way—to meet President Hinckley’s challenge to do better at getting the gospel down into our hearts and the hearts of those we love and serve is to focus all we do on the Atonement of Christ. And so, as a newly called stake presidency, we tried to do just that.
We laid down a rule that every sacrament meeting talk and every lesson in Sunday School, Relief Society, and priesthood meetings must be related to the Atonement of Christ in a direct and express way. Our goal was to have all of our meetin</span>
