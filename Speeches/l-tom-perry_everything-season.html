  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="&lt;i&gt;To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted. &lt;/i&gt;[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2]

The Lord has a marvelous system for providing for his children here on earth. The creation account found in Moses tells how our earth was formed and how the necessary elements were prepared for life to exist.

First, God said, “Let there be light; and there was light” (Moses 2:3). Then God divided the light from the darkness, and day and night were created. Next, the waters were divided to create the firmament or heaven. The third day the land and the waters were separated, “And the earth brought forth grass, every herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, after his kind” (Moses 2:12).

On the fourth day, the lights were set in the firmament, the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night, to “be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years” (Moses 2:14).

Living creatures were formed on the fifth day—those to inhabit the waters, the land, and the sky, and each “after his kind.”

Finally, God created man in his own image, and told him to “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it” (Moses 2:28). He gave him dominion over every living thing; every herb bearing seed and every fruit of a tree yielding seed were given him for meat or food. Thus we see the Lord made provision for seasons, for seeds, for herbs, and for ways for man to plant and harvest.

The harvest is always a special time. I still marvel that tiny seeds, carefully nurtured, produce a bounteous harvest. The Lord’s system is still in place.

I have pleasant memories associated with the fall season of the year and the time of the harvest. After eight years of living in sunny California, we moved to New York, where I was again reminded of the more dramatic seasonal changes of a cooler climate.

One morning as I was walking down the street on the way to the train station, kicking through the leaves that had fallen on the walk overnight, I suddenly had the urge, the strongest urge, to bite into a beautiful crisp, red apple. The association of the rustle of the leaves and that taste of an apple just seemed to go together. I could hardly wait to arrive in the city and find a fruit stand to buy one. I was not disappointed; the falling leaves and a big, red apple were just as pleasant to enjoy as I remembered from my boyhood.

In this area, the fall season and the time of the harvest go together. The Savior often used common, ordinary activities of life to illustrate a message. Since this is the season of the harvest, let us look at how the Savior used the example of the harvest in his teachings.

First, let’s turn to a parable given to us in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Matthew, starting with verse twenty-four:

&lt;i&gt;Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. &lt;/i&gt;[Matthew 13:24–30]

Then continuing on, after the multitudes had left, the disciples asked Jesus:

&lt;i&gt;Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And shall cast them into a furnace of fire:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. &lt;/i&gt;[Matthew 13:36–43]

We must continually be thinking about our preparation for the time of the harvest. Our challenge is to protect the tender plants among the tares that choke out and leave us no credit or return for a life of toil. We must learn what it is that can be harvested to help us enjoy life eternal. Could we look at just the three essential ingredients that will insure us of a bounteous harvest? First, President Kimball taught us about our quest for knowledge of God in contrast to secular learning. In his writings he said:

&lt;i&gt;In what kind of ignorance is the danger of damnation? In what kind of knowledge is found power, and what power comes from knowledge? Let us analyze this great truth. In proper sequence, first comes the knowledge of God and his program, which is the way to eternal life, and then comes the knowledge of the secular things, which is also very important. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Peter and John had little secular learning, being termed ignorant. But they knew the vital things of life, that God lives and that the crucified, resurrected Lord is the Son of God. They knew the path to eternal life. This they learned in a few decades of their mortal life. Their righteous lives opened the door to godhood for them and creation of worlds with eternal increase. For this they would probably need, eventually, a total knowledge of the sciences. But whereas Peter and John had only decades to learn and do the spiritual, they have already had nineteen centuries in which to learn the secular or the geology of the earth, the zoology and physiology and psychology of the creatures of the earth. Mortality is the time to learn first of God and the gospel and to perform the ordinances. After our feet are set firmly on the path to eternal life we can amass more knowledge of the secular things.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The so-called ignorant Peter and John are heirs to exaltation and can learn what they need to know to create worlds. A highly trained scientist who is also a perfected man may create a world and people it, but a dissolute, unrepentant, unbelieving one will never be such a creator even in the eternities.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Secular knowledge, important as it may be, can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom nor create a world nor make a man a god, but it can be most helpful to that man who, placing first things first, has found the way to eternal life and who can now bring into play all knowledge to be his tool and servant. &lt;/i&gt;[Spencer W. Kimball, &lt;i&gt;President Kimball Speaks Out &lt;/i&gt;(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981), p. 90–92]

A second area to consider in the harvest of our mortal experience is honesty. The thirteenth article of faith says, “We believe in being honest.”

The Book of Mormon tells us about a group of people who were “distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end” (Alma 27:27).

Because of their honesty, these people were noted by their fellow beings, as well as by God. It is important to learn what honesty is, how we are tempted to be dishonest, and how we can overcome this temptation. Complete honesty is necessary for our salvation.

Elder Mark E. Petersen once said, “Honesty is a principle of salvation in the kingdom of God. . . . Just as no man or woman can be saved without baptism, so no one can be saved without honesty” (&lt;i&gt;CR, &lt;/i&gt;October 1971, p. 63).

The honest person loves truth and justice. He is honest in his words and actions. He does not lie. Lying is intentionally deceiving others. The Lord gave this commandment to the children of Israel: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16).

Jesus also taught when he was on earth that bearing false witness is a form of lying (see Matthew 19:18). There are many ways of lying. When we speak untruths, we are guilty of lying. We can also intentionally deceive others by our gestures, by a look, by silence, or by telling only part of a truth. Whenever we lead people in any way to believe something that is not true, we are not being honest. The Lord is not pleased with such dishonesty, and we will have to account for our lies.

Many in the world would have us believe that it is all right to lie. They say, “Lie a little; . . . there is no harm in this” (2 Nephi 28:8). Satan, knowing the consequences, also tempts us to lie and then encourages us to justify our lies to ourselves. An honest person will recognize Satan’s temptation and will speak the whole truth, even if it seems to be to his disadvantage.

An honest person does not steal. Jesus taught while he was on earth “Thou shalt not steal” (Matthew 19:18). Stealing is taking something that does not belong to us. When we take what belongs to another person, or from a store, or our school, or a community, without permission, we are stealing. Taking merchandise or supplies from an employer is thievery. Accepting goods from one who is dishonest, or taking more than our share of anything, is stealing.

An honest person does not cheat. We cheat when we give less than we owe, or when we get something we do not deserve. Some employees cheat their employers by not working their full time, then accepting full pay. Some employers are not fair with their employees by paying less than they deserve. Providing inferior service or merchandise is also cheating.

There must be no excuse accepted for dishonesty, though many excuses are used. People lie to protect themselves and also to make others think well of them. Some excuse themselves for stealing, thinking that they deserve what they took, or intending to return it, or thinking they need it more than the owners. Some cheat to get better grades in school, or because someone else does it, or even to get even. These excuses, and many more, are given as reasons for dishonesty.

In the Lord’s eyes, there is no acceptable reason. President Kimball has told us that when we excuse ourselves, we cheat ourselves, and the spirit of God ceases to strive with us. We become more and more unrighteous.

You might ask, “How can we be completely honest?” To be completely honest, we must look carefully at our lives and have the courage to face the whole truth. If there are ways in which we are being even the least bit dishonest, we should begin at once to repent from them. When we are completely honest, we cannot be corrupted. We are true to every trust, duty, agreement, and covenant, even if it costs us money, friends, or our lives. Then we can face the Lord, ourselves, and others without shame.

President Joseph F. Smith counseled us:

&lt;i&gt;Let every man’s life be so that his character will bear the closest inspection, and that it may be seen as an open book, so that he will have nothing to shrink from or be ashamed of.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;GD, &lt;/i&gt;p. 252]

Third, in the record of my harvest, I would like to have my granary full of eager service. Service seems to follow true conversion. We have many examples in the scriptures of what happens when conversion takes place. I like the account of Alma in the book of Mosiah because of the mighty change that occurred after his remarkable conversion. The scriptures record:

&lt;i&gt;Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And now it came to pass that Alma began&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them. &lt;/i&gt;[Mosiah 27:8–9, 11–12, 19–20, 23–24, 32]

You see the inactivity brought about with a visitation of an angel, which brought a desire of service. The value of service in the Church was of equal worth to me as the years I spent in getting an education. I remember early in my business career I was given a great opportunity with a retail firm. It was a great opportunity. Of course, immediately following World War II, employment opportunities were easy to find. Businesses were starting to fill their executive ranks after years of personnel shortages as men and women who had been engaged in the war effort were returning home. After six months with the firm as an internal auditor, I was promoted to controller of one of their units. I was poorly prepared for such a promotion. I left my wife and two little children where we were then living to sell our home, and I set out on my new assignment.

The work was challenging and difficult. It was more than I could handle during the normal working day. I found myself often working through the night, catching an occasional nap at my desk, to keep going as the night progressed. In fact, it turned out to be almost every other night that I would remain in the office.

In a couple of weeks our home sold, and I arranged to drive back to pick up my family and bring them to our new residence. After getting my family settled, I let my wife know what my work schedule was. Needless to say, she wasn’t very happy with the arrangement and the burden she had at home with two small children. She wanted some assistance there. I tried to explain how burdened I was at the office and that it wouldn’t last forever.

After just a few days of having the family together again, I was home having dinner one evening expecting to go back to the office. A car pulled up in front of our apartment. A man came to the door and introduced himself as a member of our stake presidency. He invited me to come out and visit with him in his car. As we approached the car, I could see a counselor from our bishopric seated in the front seat. Inside the car, it was explained to me that they were reorganizing the bishopric of our ward on the next Sunday, and the counselor was to become the new bishop. He turned to me and called me to become his second counselor.

I paused for some time before responding, wondering how I could take on any more in my life. However, the example and training I had received in my home as I was growing up fortified and strengthened me, and I agreed to serve. It turned out to be one of the great blessings of my life. This new bishop taught me the art of delegation and how to organize my time much better. My life became almost normal once again, which, of course, pleased my wife and family.

This was followed by service in two bishoprics, two high councils, two stake presidencies, and finally as a stake president before being called to serve as a General Authority in Salt Lake. Church service is the best schoolmaster I know to teach human relations, a quality I believe is essential to all who want to succeed. It is difficult to stay even with the Lord. The more you give, the greater will be your blessings.

In conclusion, let us turn to the writings of Paul to the Galatian Saints:

&lt;i&gt;Be ye not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And let us not weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. &lt;/i&gt;[Galatians 6:7–10]

As we experience the beauties of another plentiful harvest season, may it remind us of the preparation we must continually be making to ensure ourselves of a bounteous harvest from the efforts of a lifetime, so that we may reap the rewards of enjoying life eternal with him who is the creator of all. May I urge you to do regular personal evaluations on the following important lifetime efforts:

1. Remember in your quest for knowledge to &lt;i&gt;balance your studies between gospel truths and secular learning. &lt;/i&gt;The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants to “seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 109:7).

2. Remember the &lt;i&gt;value of absolute integrity and honesty.&lt;/i&gt;

3. Learn the joy of &lt;i&gt;gospel service.&lt;/i&gt;

Your good works will be rewarded: Our Lord and Savior will bless your righteous efforts with a complete and fulfilling life.

I give you my solemn witness that God lives! Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. We are engaged in his work. It is my witness to you if you follow him you will find that fulfillment you are seeking to find in this mortal experience which is yours. May God bless each of us with a firm determination to follow the counsel we’ve been given in the holy scriptures is my humble prayer, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted. </i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2]</p>
<p>The Lord has a marvelous system for providing for his children here on earth. The creation account found in Moses tells how our earth was formed and how the necessary elements were prepared for life to exist.</p>
<p>First, God said, “Let there be light; and there was light” (Moses 2:3). Then God divided the light from the darkness, and day and night were created. Next, the waters were divided to create the firmament or heaven. The third day the land and the waters were separated, “And the earth brought forth grass, every herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, after his kind” (Moses 2:12).</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the lights were set in the firmament, the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night, to “be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years” (Moses 2:14).</p>
<p>Living creatures were formed on the fifth day—those to inhabit the waters, the land, and the sky, and each “after his kind.”</p>
<p>Finally, God created man in his own image, and told him to “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it” (Moses 2:28). He gave him dominion over every living thing; every herb bearing seed and every fruit of a tree yielding seed were given him for meat or food. Thus we see the Lord made provision for seasons, for seeds, for herbs, and for ways for man to plant and harvest.</p>
<p>The harvest is always a special time. I still marvel that tiny seeds, carefully nurtured, produce a bounteous harvest. The Lord’s system is still in place.</p>
<p>I have pleasant memories associated with the fall season of the year and the time of the harvest. After eight years of living in sunny California, we moved to New York, where I was again reminded of the more dramatic seasonal changes of a cooler climate.</p>
<p>One morning as I was walking down the street on the way to the train station, kicking through the leaves that had fallen on the walk overnight, I suddenly had the urge, the strongest urge, to bite into a beautiful crisp, red apple. The association of the rustle of the leaves and that taste of an apple just seemed to go together. I could hardly wait to arrive in the city and find a fruit stand to buy one. I was not disappointed; the falling leaves and a big, red apple were just as pleasant to enjoy as I remembered from my boyhood.</p>
<p>In this area, the fall season and the time of the harvest go together. The Savior often used common, ordinary activities of life to illustrate a message. Since this is the season of the harvest, let us look at how the Savior used the example of the harvest in his teachings.</p>
<p>First, let’s turn to a parable given to us in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Matthew, starting with verse twenty-four:</p>
<p><i>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</i></p>
<p><i>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</i></p>
<p><i>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</i></p>
<p><i>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</i></p>
<p><i>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</i></p>
<p><i>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</i></p>
<p><i>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. </i>[Matthew 13:24–30]</p>
<p>Then continuing on, after the multitudes had left, the disciples asked Jesus:</p>
<p><i>Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</i></p>
<p><i>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</i></p>
<p><i>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</i></p>
<p><i>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</i></p>
<p><i>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</i></p>
<p><i>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</i></p>
<p><i>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire:</i></p>
<p><i>there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</i></p>
<p><i>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. </i>[Matthew 13:36–43]</p>
<p>We must continually be thinking about our preparation for the time of the harvest. Our challenge is to protect the tender plants among the tares that choke out and leave us no credit or return for a life of toil. We must learn what it is that can be harvested to help us enjoy life eternal. Could we look at just the three essential ingredients that will insure us of a bounteous harvest? First, President Kimball taught us about our quest for knowledge of God in contrast to secular learning. In his writings he said:</p>
<p><i>In what kind of ignorance is the danger of damnation? In what kind of knowledge is found power, and what power comes from knowledge? Let us analyze this great truth. In proper sequence, first comes the knowledge of God and his program, which is the way to eternal life, and then comes the knowledge of the secular things, which is also very important. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Peter and John had little secular learning, being termed ignorant. But they knew the vital things of life, that God lives and that the crucified, resurrected Lord is the Son of God. They knew the path to eternal life. This they learned in a few decades of their mortal life. Their righteous lives opened the door to godhood for them and creation of worlds with eternal increase. For this they would probably need, eventually, a total knowledge of the sciences. But whereas Peter and John had only decades to learn and do the spiritual, they have already had nineteen centuries in which to learn the secular or the geology of the earth, the zoology and physiology and psychology of the creatures of the earth. Mortality is the time to learn first of God and the gospel and to perform the ordinances. After our feet are set firmly on the path to eternal life we can amass more knowledge of the secular things.</i></p>
<p><i>The so-called ignorant Peter and John are heirs to exaltation and can learn what they need to know to create worlds. A highly trained scientist who is also a perfected man may create a world and people it, but a dissolute, unrepentant, unbelieving one will never be such a creator even in the eternities.</i></p>
<p><i>Secular knowledge, important as it may be, can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom nor create a world nor make a man a god, but it can be most helpful to that man who, placing first things first, has found the way to eternal life and who can now bring into play all knowledge to be his tool and servant. </i>[Spencer W. Kimball, <i>President Kimball Speaks Out </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981), p. 90–92]</p>
<p>A second area to consider in the harvest of our mortal experience is honesty. The thirteenth article of faith says, “We believe in being honest.”</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon tells us about a group of people who were “distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end” (Alma 27:27).</p>
<p>Because of their honesty, these people were noted by their fellow beings, as well as by God. It is important to learn what honesty is, how we are tempted to be dishonest, and how we can overcome this temptation. Complete honesty is necessary for our salvation.</p>
<p>Elder Mark E. Petersen once said, “Honesty is a principle of salvation in the kingdom of God. . . . Just as no man or woman can be saved without baptism, so no one can be saved without honesty” (<i>CR, </i>October 1971, p. 63).</p>
<p>The honest person loves truth and justice. He is honest in his words and actions. He does not lie. Lying is intentionally deceiving others. The Lord gave this commandment to the children of Israel: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16).</p>
<p>Jesus also taught when he was on earth that bearing false witness is a form of lying (see Matthew 19:18). There are many ways of lying. When we speak untruths, we are guilty of lying. We can also intentionally deceive others by our gestures, by a look, by silence, or by telling only part of a truth. Whenever we lead people in any way to believe something that is not true, we are not being honest. The Lord is not pleased with such dishonesty, and we will have to account for our lies.</p>
<p>Many in the world would have us believe that it is all right to lie. They say, “Lie a little; . . . there is no harm in this” (2 Nephi 28:8). Satan, knowing the consequences, also tempts us to lie and then encourages us to justify our lies to ourselves. An honest person will recognize Satan’s temptation and will speak the whole truth, even if it seems to be to his disadvantage.</p>
<p>An honest person does not steal. Jesus taught while he was on earth “Thou shalt not steal” (Matthew 19:18). Stealing is taking something that does not belong to us. When we take what belongs to another person, or from a store, or our school, or a community, without permission, we are stealing. Taking merchandise or supplies from an employer is thievery. Accepting goods from one who is dishonest, or taking more than our share of anything, is stealing.</p>
<p>An honest person does not cheat. We cheat when we give less than we owe, or when we get something we do not deserve. Some employees cheat their employers by not working their full time, then accepting full pay. Some employers are not fair with their employees by paying less than they deserve. Providing inferior service or merchandise is also cheating.</p>
<p>There must be no excuse accepted for dishonesty, though many excuses are used. People lie to protect themselves and also to make others think well of them. Some excuse themselves for stealing, thinking that they deserve what they took, or intending to return it, or thinking they need it more than the owners. Some cheat to get better grades in school, or because someone else does it, or even to get even. These excuses, and many more, are given as reasons for dishonesty.</p>
<p>In the Lord’s eyes, there is no acceptable reason. President Kimball has told us that when we excuse ourselves, we cheat ourselves, and the spirit of God ceases to strive with us. We become more and more unrighteous.</p>
<p>You might ask, “How can we be completely honest?” To be completely honest, we must look carefully at our lives and have the courage to face the whole truth. If there are ways in which we are being even the least bit dishonest, we should begin at once to repent from them. When we are completely honest, we cannot be corrupted. We are true to every trust, duty, agreement, and covenant, even if it costs us money, friends, or our lives. Then we can face the Lord, ourselves, and others without shame.</p>
<p>President Joseph F. Smith counseled us:</p>
<p><i>Let every man’s life be so that his character will bear the closest inspection, and that it may be seen as an open book, so that he will have nothing to shrink from or be ashamed of.</i> [<i>GD, </i>p. 252]</p>
<p>Third, in the record of my harvest, I would like to have my granary full of eager service. Service seems to follow true conversion. We have many examples in the scriptures of what happens when conversion takes place. I like the account of Alma in the book of Mosiah because of the mighty change that occurred after his remarkable conversion. The scriptures record:</p>
<p><i>Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</i></p>
<p><i>And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</i></p>
<p><i>And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</i></p>
<p><i>And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</i></p>
<p><i>For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>And now it came to pass that Alma began</i></p>
<p><i>from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them. </i>[Mosiah 27:8–9, 11–12, 19–20, 23–24, 32]</p>
<p>You see the inactivity brought about with a visitation of an angel, which brought a desire of service. The value of service in the Church was of equal worth to me as the years I spent in getting an education. I remember early in my business career I was given a great opportunity with a retail firm. It was a great opportunity. Of course, immediately following World War II, employment opportunities were easy to find. Businesses were starting to fill their executive ranks after years of personnel shortages as men and women who had been engaged in the war effort were returning home. After six months with the firm as an internal auditor, I was promoted to controller of one of their units. I was poorly prepared for such a promotion. I left my wife and two little children where we were then living to sell our home, and I set out on my new assignment.</p>
<p>The work was challenging and difficult. It was more than I could handle during the normal working day. I found myself often working through the night, catching an occasional nap at my desk, to keep going as the night progressed. In fact, it turned out to be almost every other night that I would remain in the office.</p>
<p>In a couple of weeks our home sold, and I arranged to drive back to pick up my family and bring them to our new residence. After getting my family settled, I let my wife know what my work schedule was. Needless to say, she wasn’t very happy with the arrangement and the burden she had at home with two small children. She wanted some assistance there. I tried to explain how burdened I was at the office and that it wouldn’t last forever.</p>
<p>After just a few days of having the family together again, I was home having dinner one evening expecting to go back to the office. A car pulled up in front of our apartment. A man came to the door and introduced himself as a member of our stake presidency. He invited me to come out and visit with him in his car. As we approached the car, I could see a counselor from our bishopric seated in the front seat. Inside the car, it was explained to me that they were reorganizing the bishopric of our ward on the next Sunday, and the counselor was to become the new bishop. He turned to me and called me to become his second counselor.</p>
<p>I paused for some time before responding, wondering how I could take on any more in my life. However, the example and training I had received in my home as I was growing up fortified and strengthened me, and I agreed to serve. It turned out to be one of the great blessings of my life. This new bishop taught me the art of delegation and how to organize my time much better. My life became almost normal once again, which, of course, pleased my wife and family.</p>
<p>This was followed by service in two bishoprics, two high councils, two stake presidencies, and finally as a stake president before being called to serve as a General Authority in Salt Lake. Church service is the best schoolmaster I know to teach human relations, a quality I believe is essential to all who want to succeed. It is difficult to stay even with the Lord. The more you give, the greater will be your blessings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let us turn to the writings of Paul to the Galatian Saints:</p>
<p><i>Be ye not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i></p>
<p><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i></p>
<p><i>And let us not weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</i></p>
<p><i>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. </i>[Galatians 6:7–10]</p>
<p>As we experience the beauties of another plentiful harvest season, may it remind us of the preparation we must continually be making to ensure ourselves of a bounteous harvest from the efforts of a lifetime, so that we may reap the rewards of enjoying life eternal with him who is the creator of all. May I urge you to do regular personal evaluations on the following important lifetime efforts:</p>
<p>1. Remember in your quest for knowledge to <i>balance your studies between gospel truths and secular learning. </i>The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants to “seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 109:7).</p>
<p>2. Remember the <i>value of absolute integrity and honesty.</i></p>
<p>3. Learn the joy of <i>gospel service.</i></p>
<p>Your good works will be rewarded: Our Lord and Savior will bless your righteous efforts with a complete and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>I give you my solemn witness that God lives! Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. We are engaged in his work. It is my witness to you if you follow him you will find that fulfillment you are seeking to find in this mortal experience which is yours. May God bless each of us with a firm determination to follow the counsel we’ve been given in the holy scriptures is my humble prayer, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When I came to campus this morning, I had a bit of a panic, and it wasn’t at the thought of you, because you all are an awesome sight. It was seeing the signs—those big signs at the entrance to campus. I have to admit that those signs always give me a little panicky feeling because they are a reminder that this is the place where I was abandoned by my parents. This is the place where I was left to figure things out on my own and to wonder, “Am I even smart enough to be here?”
But today these signs gave me this panic because I knew I was coming here to campus—a place that cultivates knowledge and reveres intelligence—to talk about the dangers of knowledge and the downside of intelligence. Essentially I was coming here to ask this question: Can we actually get too smart?
You have probably heard this saying: “Knowledge is power.” But today I want to ask, Is there actually more power in not knowing? I want to make a case for ignorance—not ignorance as in stupidity or the lack of education but simply the lack of certainty.
My dad had a saying. He used to say, “It looks like someone has gotten too big for their britches.” By this he meant that they were a little too full of themselves, a little too much of a smarty-pants. As we gain knowledge and intelligence and as we get smart, can we get a little too full of ourselves? A little too smart for our own good and maybe even a little too smart for the good of others?
I want to center our conversation today on two questions. They are both questions that I have spent years researching and writing about. The first is a question about leadership: How does the knowledge of a leader affect the intelligence of the team around them and why is it that some leaders seem to amplify the intelligence of people around them while other leaders seem to just suck the intelligence and life right out of a room?
That is our first question. The second question is a question about learning and performance. I want to begin with the first question.
Multiplier Leadership
When I graduated from BYU and from the Marriott School, I took a job working for a small maverick software company called Oracle. No one knew this company at the time; people thought it was a toothbrush manufacturer. Oracle had a very simple and clear hiring ­strategy: hire the top grads out of the top schools, mix them all together, and just see what happens.
At the time, Oracle didn’t recruit at BYU, and Oracle did not actively recruit me. I simply found Oracle and wiggled my way into the mix. It wasn’t as if I felt like I didn’t belong there; I just felt really lucky to be working there and to be working around all these brilliant people. So I became a genius watcher.
I could see how intelligence—just raw ­brilliance and smarts—was a really powerful tool for growth and for innovation, but I could also see how intelligence was being used as a weapon. W</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful for the opportunity the administration affords me to speak to you today. I am particularly grateful for the friends and family who have gathered here to support me and for the special privilege of having my father and my mother, Larry and Kathy Hickman, in the audience. So much of what I have been able to become is due to them.
In the next few minutes I hope to make the case that through the grace of Christ’s Atonement both you and I have been given the chance to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost in our reading, writing, and speaking in ways that will open our eyes to new knowledge and to better ways of thinking about the challenges that beset us.
For me, one of the most intriguing chapters of the Book of Mormon is Ether 12, in which Moroni pauses in his translation of the Jaredite record to catalogue the many miracles that occurred because of faith put into action. Partway through this list Moroni seems to face a crisis of his own faith—at least as it touches upon the future reception of the scriptural record that he is creating for an audience in our day and time. He writes:
And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast made us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;
And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.
Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words. [Ether 12:23–25]
As an English professor whose own work focuses on twentieth-century and contemporary American literary history, several aspects of Moroni’s concerns interest me. First, Moroni’s sense of our time—that it would be an era characterized, among other things, by “mockery”—strikes me as unusually perceptive. Ours is indeed an age whose dominant mode is that of irony. On the heels of two world wars and many other regional ones, in the wake of some of the worst genocides in history, and in the aftermath of countless scandals in politics, business, and even religion, irony emerges in our day as a kind of cultural defense mechanism, a way of acknowledging that since things are rarely what they appear to be, nothing should be taken without the proverbial grain of salt.
In our day we luxuriate in an unprecedented omnipresence of information but paradoxically distrust this information more than ever because of its potential for ma</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The operation on the infected leg of the Prophet Joseph Smith gives us a story about nobility and the comfort that comes from faith in a loving father. There is also another, less well-known lesson hidden in this story. The doctor attending Joseph at the end of the ordeal is sometimes portrayed as a humble country doctor with uncertain skills. But Elder Neal A. Maxwell pointed out that this was not the case, citing Dr. LeRoy S. Wirthlin, a Latter-day Saint doctor who researched the event:
The medical doctor in final attendance . . . was Dr. Nathan Smith, founder of the Dartmouth Medical School. He brought two doctors and several medical students with him to attend to young Joseph. . . . Dr. Nathan Smith was highly qualified, and he was using a very advanced technique. Thus “the only man in America who could save [Joseph’s] leg was just five miles away.”1
Elder Maxwell then went on to explain how Dr. Smith happened to be in the vicinity of Joseph Smith’s home because his plans to leave the area were “delayed by a typhoid epidemic.”2
In addition to the academic and spiritual knowledge you are gaining at BYU, the skills you are developing are also very important—though, like Dr. Smith, you probably do not now understand how important they will be, nor to whom they will be valuable. When Dr. Smith’s skills were needed, the Lord managed the circumstances to make them available to Joseph when and where they were critically needed.
Skill, even specialized skill, plays an important role in the Lord’s plans. We are told that the Lord often answers our prayers through the ministrations of our family, friends, neighbors, and church leaders. In the case of Joseph’s leg, it was a stranger who had the necessary skill to save his leg. As Saints we are taught to rely on God to watch over us and to supply our needs, but we also have the responsibility to prepare ourselves however possible against a time of need. That’s why we follow the counsel of the prophets to strive to obtain all of the education we possibly can. Brigham Young described the scope of the skills and knowledge we might consider cultivating: “Every accomplishment, every polished grace, every useful attainment in mathematics, music, and in all science and art belong to the Saints.”3
We do not rely on the arm of flesh, but a steady, experienced arm in the time of need, guided by the Spirit of God, can make a difference: “To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.”4 This includes learning in useful skills.
Many of us have patriarchal blessings that advise us to cultivate our abilities in a particular area. I would like to share with you some of my own understandings about skills and how they might figure into our ability to perform our earthly missions.
We could begin by asking, “How pervasive are skills in our everyday actions?” Some skil</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">If there is one thing that distinguishes the university from other institutions of learning, it is the expectation to advance knowledge. The mission of most educational institutions is to pass on what is already known. Our high school teachers distilled their lessons from books that had already been written. At the university we engage in this dissemination too, but we have the further obligation to add to the bank of human knowledge by asking new questions or using new sources and methods to find better answers to old questions. Increasingly, through programs such as mentored learning, rather than just giving students the answers to the questions that have already been asked, we are inviting you to join us in the asking of the questions. We want you to experience the university as a place to actively pursue knowledge rather than only passively acquire it.
Justly or not, we often credit the Greeks for this inquisitive approach to the world. They did invent historia, a word that for them had a more encompassing meaning than the word history has for us today. For the Greeks, history meant knowledge, but only of a particular kind: history was any knowledge that had been acquired through inquiry, by asking questions. This was a significant development that made the Greeks among the most learned of cultures in multiple fields. When Herodotus, who we like to call the first historian, wrote The Histories, also called The Inquiries, of the origins of the Greco-Persian wars and of the cultures of the Near East, he did so based not on hearsay, rumor, and prejudice, which had been the common practice, but by asking lots of questions and engaging in extensive travel in the places he wrote about. He did not always get the facts right, but what is important is that he made every effort—by careful and persistent questioning—to get them right.
Today I’d like to address the value and practice of learning, particularly learning by asking questions. Of all the lessons Christ taught in the Sermon on the Mount, the counsel “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find”1 is among the most cited in later scripture. What is the import of that exhortation for those of us who should be engaged in the pursuit of secular knowledge, eternal truths, and personal virtues?
Most of what you and I know we picked up passively: in conversations overheard, from unsolicited lectures from our parents, from TV productions, and in casual reading. In other words, most of what I know came to me without my seeking it, without my asking questions that led to new knowledge, and hence that knowledge doesn’t qualify as “history” by the Greek definition. There is nothing at all wrong with passive learning; it will forever be an essential means of both cultural and academic transmission. As a professional student, I have sat through what must be hundreds of hours of lectures, and I have learned a g</span>
