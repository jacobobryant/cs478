  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="As my oldest son, Ryan, was a little more than halfway through his studies on this campus, he and I started what was to become a family tradition of attending Tuesday devotionals and forums together each week. Afterward I would treat him to lunch so that we could discuss what we had learned. This gave me an opportunity to observe how things were going in his life. This tradition has continued with each of our children. Our youngest child, Robyn, asked me a question as we exited the Marriott Center last fall semester: "Dad, when are you going to speak in a devotional?"

My reply was simple and to the point: "Ill likely never be asked because of all the other qualified people they have to choose from."

This experience reminded me of a comment I made to my wife, Ralene, soon after we were married and were living in Texas. I told her that we would likely never live near her parents, who lived here in Utah County. Based upon my choice to be a musician, the likelihood of living anywhere in the Intermountain West seemed remote. An unexpected phone call came while I was teaching at Indiana State University, and the invitation to come and join the faculty on this campus was extended. It has proven to be a wonderful blessing for our family and an opportunity for my own personal growth and service. The lesson learned? Never say never!

As a percussionist, I play a number of different instruments in a myriad of musical styles. I have colleagues who specialize on certain instruments, but my motto has always been "If you shake, scrape, or hit it, I play it." Performing on marimba, vibraphone, and crotales with the Utah Symphony, timpani with Ballet West, a drum set on a jazz gig, or African hand drums in a recording session for a Tahitian Noni infomercial allows me the variety I thrive on. There is seldom, if ever, a time when I feel like Im in a rut. With that variety comes the challenge of finding time to know what instrument to practice and in what musical style.

Keeping balance in my percussion-playing life has always been a challenge. As a young, new faculty member here, I often traveled up to Salt Lake City to rehearse or perform with a variety of groups. Frequently I would rush home after a busy day on campus only to ask Ralene to pack me a sandwich while I changed clothes or loaded some percussion equipment into my truck. My son Ryan - who was then only 10 years old - observed the way my life was going and waited for the perfect opportunity to teach his dad a very important lesson. That moment came one day when I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He responded, "I dont know exactly what career I want, but I know what I &lt;i&gt;dont&lt;/i&gt; want to be - a musician." I was stunned. He then recounted my multiple refueling sessions, with me hurrying home only to leave again for another engagement.

I reflected upon what he said and was reminded of an experience from my own childhood when I watched the Ed Sullivan variety show on television. Now a variety show was as popular then as reality TV is today. Along with acts like the Beatles, comedians, singers, and tap dancers, there was a performer who would frequently appear on this show whose act consisted of an array of long wooden poles upon which he would carefully place ceramic plates. With a deft hand he would spin each plate while some silly "oompah" music played in the background. As he spun his fifth or sixth plate, inevitably plate number two or three would start to wobble, and he would have to hurry back to increase their spin before they crashed to the floor. It was a riveting display of skill, timing, and speed. Viewers across the nation watched eagerly to see if he could spin all of the plates on every wobbling dowel.

As you are turning in projects, papers, and preparing for finals, perhaps you feel like you are trying to keep too many plates spinning. Our challenge is often deciding how many plates to try to spin and for how long. In 1987 Elder M. Russell Ballard was recovering from a serious illness and felt prompted to speak in April general conference on "Keeping Lifes Demands in Balance" (&lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1987, 1316). In that address he offered eight suggestions, which I have paraphrased:

1. Think about your life and set your priorities.

2. Set short-term goals that you can reach.

3. Budget wisely and prepare for financial challenges.

4. Stay close to your spouse, children, family, and friends.

5. Study the scriptures.

6. Find time for sufficient rest, relaxation, and exercise.

7. Hold weekly family home evenings.

8. Pray as individuals and as families.

If we view each of these suggestions as an essential pole upon which we need to spin a plate, our ability to deal with the challenges of life will improve.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set Your Priorities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Think about your life and set your priorities. As a young freshman on this campus, I knew I wanted to do something with music. Throughout my childhood my parents arranged for private music lessons, purchased instruments, and provided me the opportunity to attend schools and summer camps that gave me wonderful musical experiences. When I announced to them sometime during my senior year in high school that I wanted to pursue music for a career, they were suddenly less than enthusiastic. Both of my parents were trained musicians, although my father worked as a corporate executive professionally. They had met each other through music - he was a violinist, and she was his accompanist on piano. When they expressed their "nonsupport" in my choice to make music my career, I was even more determined to succeed. I spent many hours thinking deeply about what I wanted to accomplish in my life. Choosing a major was never a problem for me, but deciding on a career path was something that took years of reflection and refinement. Making slight alterations to basic guiding principles is not a problem. The refining process of ones career choice is a method that allows you to tweak your goals through your efforts and hard work.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set Short-Term Goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Whether you feel your priorities are already set or still in process, our next plate that must be spinning on a regular basis is the habit of setting short-term goals. Without goals it will be difficult for those priorities to become a reality, and we begin the process of living life in "coasting mode." Time passes each of us by whether we are accomplishing much with that time or not. Life on this earth is a precious gift. The process of setting, achieving, and reviewing our goals is a lifelong process. Reviewing what we have or have not accomplished helps us to reevaluate whether the goal we set was realistic or helpful. Having the courage to make changes and then pursue what we desire with the right attitude can make a big difference in our ability to succeed.

As you travel home at the conclusion of finals for the Christmas holiday, you might consider taking the time to evaluate your experiences this semester. What went well? What would you do differently? You could even set new goals to make next semester or the next important step in your life more rewarding.

The Church teaches us the importance of this process in Primary as our preteens fulfill the requirements in the &lt;i&gt;Faith in God&lt;/i&gt; booklets. The same is true of our Young Men and Young Women programs, where you meet with a member of your bishopric to review your accomplishments in your &lt;i&gt;Personal Progress&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Duty to God&lt;/i&gt; booklet. You can continue to utilize some of these same concepts and principles in your adult life. How grateful I am for parents, teachers, mentors, friends, and my patriarchal blessing. Each were valuable resources for me in making crucial choices in my life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget Wisely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Another important plate to spin well has to do with how we deal with our finances. As the husband in a newly married couple, I assumed the role of chief financial officer in our family. After three months my patient wife sat me down and helped me see that the direction I was taking us wasnt faring too well. Ralene had a degree in personal finance, and my creative, musical concepts of how to spend, save, and invest simply werent working - largely because the last two elements (saving and investing) were missing from my financial formula! Fortunately I was willing to listen and learn. Each Sunday evening we would sit at the kitchen table to view financial ledger sheets she had prepared. When I started doing freelance work while going to school full-time, our income fluctuated from month to month. She was always able to demonstrate on those ledger sheets how the money I had projected we would earn the next month was already spent. Those were depressing meetings for me. I felt as if I was working hard for little or no gain. With time I was able to learn how to handle my spending habits. I made it a point to always pay the Lord as well as myself while also paying our bills.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closeness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Our relationships with those we love is another essential plate that needs our attention. As our children were growing up, Ralene and I realized that my time at home was too rare an occasion. Since she grew up on a dairy farm, we also felt that working side by side with our children was an important part of their education and training. Eventually the idea was born to start a family band. The university steel band that I had formed years ago had met with a great deal of success. There seemed to be a never-ending supply of requests for off-campus performances, and often these came during the summer months when students were home and away from campus. We came up with the idea of a family steel band knowing that we would receive engagements because of the interest demonstrated by the university group. Instruments were purchased, and we began to rehearse. One of our earliest performances was to play poolside at a country club. It was a three-hour job, and we could only play 10 tunes. I knew we werent ready to accept such a long engagement but took the job anyway because I felt that my children werent putting enough effort into their personal practice or at our rehearsals. By playing this job they would learn just how much more they needed to prepare.

The appointed evening arrived. We set up our instruments and tried to look our professional best. We played all 10 of our tunes and took a break. That took up the first hour, and we hadnt had any real musical crisis. We played them again - this time in a different order - and took another break. We were into our final hour of the job. I called a certain tune - "Yellow Bird," a calypso that Harry Belafonte had made famous many years ago. I was just about to count off the tune when one of the guests at the party came up to me and asked, "Youre not going to play Yellow Bird again, are you?"

"No sir," I replied, quickly calling another tune and hoping that he was well on the other side of the pool before we even thought of playing "Yellow Bird" again. Needless to say, we learned a great deal from that experience and have since learned from many other opportunities performing at conventions, arts festivals, performing arts tours, and even performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the Conference Center.

The band went through several transformations as children grew into and out of the band. Ryan now works as a scientist in Salt Lake City, Regan performs with the Army Blues Jazz Big Band in Washington, D.C., and Roger is serving a mission in South Korea. With only Robyn remaining at home, we tried to keep the family band going by hiring some of my colleagues and musical heroes. They are great musicians, and it was a thrill to have them in the band.

At the end of one of our performances, my wife looked at me and said, "This isnt fun anymore. It feels like work." I knew what she meant. Although these newcomers to our band were great musicians, the band had become something more than an ensemble. Our relationship as a family was a part of what made the music happen. We decided that evening to disband the family band.

This experience reminds me of an important scripture: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Our family band served many purposes. It helped our children save for their missions, learn how to work together, develop their self-esteem, and have fun - all while providing a service to others. But this is a plate I no longer spin in my life, and I can channel those energies elsewhere.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study the Scriptures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Regular study of the scriptures as a family and as individuals has always been a part of our family culture. When our two youngest children, Roger and Robyn, were still preschool age, we each took a turn reading a verse. It was painful to listen to these two read an entire verse of scripture. I would cringe when they had a longer verse to read, but we kept at it. They eventually became great readers, and we learned to better understand the scriptures together.

When Robyn was a senior in high school and the only one left at home, she came to me and said, "Dad, why do we still need to read the scriptures together as a family? You know I love the scriptures, and, according to Elder Eyring, that is the purpose of family scripture study."

I went and found the &lt;i&gt;Ensign&lt;/i&gt; and read the article. Sure enough, Elder Henry B. Eyring had said:

&lt;i&gt;Its important to read the scriptures together in a way that lets your children know you include them because you love them. However, reading together may break down during the teenage years. Teens may say, "Id rather read on my own." My encouragement to families in that situation is to see that as victory, not defeat. Your child may be saying, "Im getting something when Im alone that I dont get when were all here together." Take that as a wonderful sign that scripture study is beginning to take hold in your teens heart. The main purpose is to fall in love with the scriptures and feast upon them, whether we are alone or together.&lt;/i&gt; ["A Discussion on Scripture Study," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; July 2005, 25]

Wow! I had to really alter my thinking. Robyn &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; love the scriptures and read them every night before retiring to bed. And yet I didnt want to give up that experience because it brought a great spirit into our home. What could we do differently as a family to make our time together more effective for her as well as for us? We counseled together and learned that she wanted help with memorizing her scripture mastery scriptures that year in seminary. She also wanted to read the &lt;i&gt;Preach My Gospel&lt;/i&gt; manual that was newly published. We did both. She continued reading scriptures her way in her personal study, and we all learned the scripture mastery scriptures and studied the &lt;i&gt;Preach My Gospel&lt;/i&gt; manual together. It was a wonderful experience for all three of us - even though I am a terrible memorizer.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find Time to Relax&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Since my career has also been my favorite hobby, I usually have difficulty taking time off from music-making to exercise, relax, and simply recreate. Often our first family vacations consisted of brief camping trips or visits with family. Too many times I considered tours with musical groups as vacations. It took years for my family to convince me that we needed to just "get away" and have time together without work-related distractions. It has been a conscious effort for me to now plan a family vacation where work is not involved. The memories made and the experiences learned have become priceless. I shudder to think of the opportunities missed when I was so busy spinning unnecessary "music-making plates" in lieu of spending time relaxing with my wife and children.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family Home Evening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Another family activity we were fairly consistent with was weekly family home evenings. Our Church leaders have taught us over and over again the importance of this weekly event and the ways that it can strengthen us and help us both individually and collectively. I am very grateful for a wife who took every opportunity to teach principles to our children. She didnt wait for Monday night to teach them. When a question was asked, it was a teaching opportunity. When there was a disagreement, it was a teaching opportunity. My father was the first to point this out to me. When he was visiting our home, he took me aside and asked if I had noticed how Ralene had just instructed one of our children. I am sure he asked that question knowing full well that I wasnt even remotely aware of what she had just done.

Growing a garden was an important part of our childrens upbringing. We always included the children in planting, weeding, and harvesting. One lesson that I learned early one Saturday morning from my wife had to do with weeding the garden. The night before we had had a rehearsal with our family band and were working on a new musical number. Ralene had had some difficulty in making her part fit with the rest of the band. She was a bit anxious and would rush some of the rhythmical figures, and it just didnt groove. We stopped to talk about the problem. Many of the children offered their suggestions to help her, but each time we played that part of the tune, she continued to rush. I didnt realize how frustrating this was for her until I asked her a simple question while pulling weeds the next morning in the garden. "Is this a plant or a weed?" I asked, looking at an array of green sprouts.

She stared at me wide-eyed and replied, "You cant tell, can you?"

My response was, "I wouldnt have asked if I knew which of these to pull and which to leave planted."

Then came the teaching moment. "Now you know how I felt last night in rehearsal."

Looking down at the ground, I had no idea which of those little green things to leave in the soil. What a great way to help me understand how she must have felt the night before, doing her best to play her notes but not knowing what to do differently to "make it groove."
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prayer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Elder Ballards final suggestion for us to keep our balance in this world and in the eternal scheme of things is prayer. As a bishop, when I interview youth, I am amazed at how many young people are faithful at saying their personal prayers at night but seldom pray in the morning. When I ask why they choose not to pray in the morning, the excuses vary, but most center on the fact that they get up too late and simply dont have the time. My next question to them is, "When you sin and make mistakes, isnt it more frequently from the time you wake up until you retire at night, or do those things occur more often from the time you fall asleep until you get up in the morning?" They are quick at getting my point.

We need our prayers just as much, if not more, at the start of our day. I can recall periods in my life when I was less consistent with morning personal prayers compared to evening prayers. Inevitably I was asking Heavenly Father in those evening prayers for forgiveness for my many mistakes and shortcomings. When I took the time in the morning to gather my thoughts, plan my day, and pray for His help and guidance, my evening prayers were frequently filled with thanksgiving for the good things that had transpired.

Family prayer is a great way to teach principles and feel love for those with whom we live. There is nothing sweeter than for me to hear my companion pray in my behalf. Hopefully she has similar feelings when I pray for her in our family prayers. Our good neighbor LaDawn Jacob often makes the statement that leaving the house without family prayer is like leaving the house naked.

Prayer is a tool to help us commune with our Father in Heaven. It is also the vehicle He can use to reveal His will to us.

President Spencer W. Kimballs words are direct, but worth our personal reflection:

&lt;i&gt;Do you get answers to your prayers? If not, perhaps you did not pay the price. Do you offer a few trite words and worn-out phrases, or do you talk intimately to the Lord? Do you pray occasionally when you should be praying regularly, often, constantly? Do you offer pennies to pay heavy debts when you should give dollars to erase that obligation?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When you pray, do you just speak, or do you also listen? Your Savior said, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." (Rev. 3:20.) . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . The Lord stands knocking. He never retreats. But he will never force himself upon us. If we ever move apart, it is we who move and not the Lord. And should we ever fail to get an answer to our prayers, we must look into our lives for a reason.&lt;/i&gt; ["Prayer," &lt;i&gt;New Era,&lt;/i&gt; March 1978, 17]

In many of the examples shared today, you may have noticed that frequently I was the one making adjustments. It wasnt enjoyable to admit my lack of financial prowess and to attend those budget meetings with my wife, nor was it always easy or fun trying to make music with my family in our first few attempts to rehearse and perform. The gentle rebuke by my young son regarding his career preference, "caving in" to my daughters desire to memorize scripture mastery scriptures, and pulling weeds in the garden were perhaps uncomfortable situations at first glance that proved to be great blessings in my life, not spineless acts of trying to please. These experiences were shared not to boast, brag, or indict. They were shared because all of us need to make changes.

We can make changes for the better. We fought for that right in the premortal existence. The ability to make choices is what allows us to "come unto Christ," as Moroni so eloquently stated at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon (Moroni 10:30, 32). There are times when we must push forward and not give in, but there are also times when we need to reconsider and alter our direction or approach.

This quote by Elder Neal A. Maxwell has been very helpful to me:

&lt;i&gt;I am going to preach a hard doctrine to you now. The submission of ones will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on Gods altar. It is a hard doctrine, but it is true. The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in Gods will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship. There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then weve really given Him the one final thing He asks of us. And the other things are not very, very important. It is the only possession we have that we can give, and there is no lessening of our agency as a result. Instead, what we see is a flowering of our talents and more and more surges of joy.&lt;/i&gt; ["Insights from My Life," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; August 2000, 9]

Whether we choose to use all eight suggestions offered by Elder Ballard or follow the advice of any number of experts in the field of "life balance," the important thing to remember is that those of us with the gift of the Holy Ghost need to utilize that gift. Having the gift of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon us is one thing. Having the &lt;i&gt;influence&lt;/i&gt; of the Holy Ghost in our lives is another. Submitting our personal will to that of our Father in Heaven allows us to receive much-needed inspiration and revelation. We dont have to be an apostle, Relief Society president, or elders quorum president to have that influence in our lives.

Elder Robert D. Hales reinforced this concept as he spoke to us in our last general conference:

&lt;i&gt;As faithful children, youth, parents, teachers, and leaders, we may receive personal revelation more frequently than we realize. The more we receive and acknowledge personal revelation, the more our testimonies grow. As a bishop, my testimony grew each time I received revelation to extend callings to ward members. That testimony has been strengthened each time I witness General Authorities and officers, Area Seventies, and stake presidents called or given new assignments. More importantly, I am strengthened by the personal revelations I receive in my role as a son of God, a husband, and a father. I am so thankful for the guidance and direction of the Spirit in our home as we seek for direction in family matters.&lt;/i&gt; ["Personal Revelation: The Teachings and Examples of the Prophets," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 2007, 88]

Each of us has the ability to receive the direction we need to achieve a balanced life. My hope and prayer is that we will do what we need to do to have the influence of our Father in Heaven in our lives. As we do our part, I testify that He will do His part to bring us eternal life and joy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>As my oldest son, Ryan, was a little more than halfway through his studies on this campus, he and I started what was to become a family tradition of attending Tuesday devotionals and forums together each week. Afterward I would treat him to lunch so that we could discuss what we had learned. This gave me an opportunity to observe how things were going in his life. This tradition has continued with each of our children. Our youngest child, Robyn, asked me a question as we exited the Marriott Center last fall semester: "Dad, when are you going to speak in a devotional?"</p>
<p>My reply was simple and to the point: "Ill likely never be asked because of all the other qualified people they have to choose from."</p>
<p>This experience reminded me of a comment I made to my wife, Ralene, soon after we were married and were living in Texas. I told her that we would likely never live near her parents, who lived here in Utah County. Based upon my choice to be a musician, the likelihood of living anywhere in the Intermountain West seemed remote. An unexpected phone call came while I was teaching at Indiana State University, and the invitation to come and join the faculty on this campus was extended. It has proven to be a wonderful blessing for our family and an opportunity for my own personal growth and service. The lesson learned? Never say never!</p>
<p>As a percussionist, I play a number of different instruments in a myriad of musical styles. I have colleagues who specialize on certain instruments, but my motto has always been "If you shake, scrape, or hit it, I play it." Performing on marimba, vibraphone, and crotales with the Utah Symphony, timpani with Ballet West, a drum set on a jazz gig, or African hand drums in a recording session for a Tahitian Noni infomercial allows me the variety I thrive on. There is seldom, if ever, a time when I feel like Im in a rut. With that variety comes the challenge of finding time to know what instrument to practice and in what musical style.</p>
<p>Keeping balance in my percussion-playing life has always been a challenge. As a young, new faculty member here, I often traveled up to Salt Lake City to rehearse or perform with a variety of groups. Frequently I would rush home after a busy day on campus only to ask Ralene to pack me a sandwich while I changed clothes or loaded some percussion equipment into my truck. My son Ryan - who was then only 10 years old - observed the way my life was going and waited for the perfect opportunity to teach his dad a very important lesson. That moment came one day when I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He responded, "I dont know exactly what career I want, but I know what I <i>dont</i> want to be - a musician." I was stunned. He then recounted my multiple refueling sessions, with me hurrying home only to leave again for another engagement.</p>
<p>I reflected upon what he said and was reminded of an experience from my own childhood when I watched the Ed Sullivan variety show on television. Now a variety show was as popular then as reality TV is today. Along with acts like the Beatles, comedians, singers, and tap dancers, there was a performer who would frequently appear on this show whose act consisted of an array of long wooden poles upon which he would carefully place ceramic plates. With a deft hand he would spin each plate while some silly "oompah" music played in the background. As he spun his fifth or sixth plate, inevitably plate number two or three would start to wobble, and he would have to hurry back to increase their spin before they crashed to the floor. It was a riveting display of skill, timing, and speed. Viewers across the nation watched eagerly to see if he could spin all of the plates on every wobbling dowel.</p>
<p>As you are turning in projects, papers, and preparing for finals, perhaps you feel like you are trying to keep too many plates spinning. Our challenge is often deciding how many plates to try to spin and for how long. In 1987 Elder M. Russell Ballard was recovering from a serious illness and felt prompted to speak in April general conference on "Keeping Lifes Demands in Balance" (<i>Ensign,</i> May 1987, 1316). In that address he offered eight suggestions, which I have paraphrased:</p>
<p>1. Think about your life and set your priorities.</p>
<p>2. Set short-term goals that you can reach.</p>
<p>3. Budget wisely and prepare for financial challenges.</p>
<p>4. Stay close to your spouse, children, family, and friends.</p>
<p>5. Study the scriptures.</p>
<p>6. Find time for sufficient rest, relaxation, and exercise.</p>
<p>7. Hold weekly family home evenings.</p>
<p>8. Pray as individuals and as families.</p>
<p>If we view each of these suggestions as an essential pole upon which we need to spin a plate, our ability to deal with the challenges of life will improve.</p>
<h2><b>Set Your Priorities</b></h2>
<p>Think about your life and set your priorities. As a young freshman on this campus, I knew I wanted to do something with music. Throughout my childhood my parents arranged for private music lessons, purchased instruments, and provided me the opportunity to attend schools and summer camps that gave me wonderful musical experiences. When I announced to them sometime during my senior year in high school that I wanted to pursue music for a career, they were suddenly less than enthusiastic. Both of my parents were trained musicians, although my father worked as a corporate executive professionally. They had met each other through music - he was a violinist, and she was his accompanist on piano. When they expressed their "nonsupport" in my choice to make music my career, I was even more determined to succeed. I spent many hours thinking deeply about what I wanted to accomplish in my life. Choosing a major was never a problem for me, but deciding on a career path was something that took years of reflection and refinement. Making slight alterations to basic guiding principles is not a problem. The refining process of ones career choice is a method that allows you to tweak your goals through your efforts and hard work.</p>
<h2><b>Set Short-Term Goals</b></h2>
<p>Whether you feel your priorities are already set or still in process, our next plate that must be spinning on a regular basis is the habit of setting short-term goals. Without goals it will be difficult for those priorities to become a reality, and we begin the process of living life in "coasting mode." Time passes each of us by whether we are accomplishing much with that time or not. Life on this earth is a precious gift. The process of setting, achieving, and reviewing our goals is a lifelong process. Reviewing what we have or have not accomplished helps us to reevaluate whether the goal we set was realistic or helpful. Having the courage to make changes and then pursue what we desire with the right attitude can make a big difference in our ability to succeed.</p>
<p>As you travel home at the conclusion of finals for the Christmas holiday, you might consider taking the time to evaluate your experiences this semester. What went well? What would you do differently? You could even set new goals to make next semester or the next important step in your life more rewarding.</p>
<p>The Church teaches us the importance of this process in Primary as our preteens fulfill the requirements in the <i>Faith in God</i> booklets. The same is true of our Young Men and Young Women programs, where you meet with a member of your bishopric to review your accomplishments in your <i>Personal Progress</i> or <i>Duty to God</i> booklet. You can continue to utilize some of these same concepts and principles in your adult life. How grateful I am for parents, teachers, mentors, friends, and my patriarchal blessing. Each were valuable resources for me in making crucial choices in my life.</p>
<h2><b>Budget Wisely</b></h2>
<p>Another important plate to spin well has to do with how we deal with our finances. As the husband in a newly married couple, I assumed the role of chief financial officer in our family. After three months my patient wife sat me down and helped me see that the direction I was taking us wasnt faring too well. Ralene had a degree in personal finance, and my creative, musical concepts of how to spend, save, and invest simply werent working - largely because the last two elements (saving and investing) were missing from my financial formula! Fortunately I was willing to listen and learn. Each Sunday evening we would sit at the kitchen table to view financial ledger sheets she had prepared. When I started doing freelance work while going to school full-time, our income fluctuated from month to month. She was always able to demonstrate on those ledger sheets how the money I had projected we would earn the next month was already spent. Those were depressing meetings for me. I felt as if I was working hard for little or no gain. With time I was able to learn how to handle my spending habits. I made it a point to always pay the Lord as well as myself while also paying our bills.</p>
<h2><b>Closeness</b></h2>
<p>Our relationships with those we love is another essential plate that needs our attention. As our children were growing up, Ralene and I realized that my time at home was too rare an occasion. Since she grew up on a dairy farm, we also felt that working side by side with our children was an important part of their education and training. Eventually the idea was born to start a family band. The university steel band that I had formed years ago had met with a great deal of success. There seemed to be a never-ending supply of requests for off-campus performances, and often these came during the summer months when students were home and away from campus. We came up with the idea of a family steel band knowing that we would receive engagements because of the interest demonstrated by the university group. Instruments were purchased, and we began to rehearse. One of our earliest performances was to play poolside at a country club. It was a three-hour job, and we could only play 10 tunes. I knew we werent ready to accept such a long engagement but took the job anyway because I felt that my children werent putting enough effort into their personal practice or at our rehearsals. By playing this job they would learn just how much more they needed to prepare.</p>
<p>The appointed evening arrived. We set up our instruments and tried to look our professional best. We played all 10 of our tunes and took a break. That took up the first hour, and we hadnt had any real musical crisis. We played them again - this time in a different order - and took another break. We were into our final hour of the job. I called a certain tune - "Yellow Bird," a calypso that Harry Belafonte had made famous many years ago. I was just about to count off the tune when one of the guests at the party came up to me and asked, "Youre not going to play Yellow Bird again, are you?"</p>
<p>"No sir," I replied, quickly calling another tune and hoping that he was well on the other side of the pool before we even thought of playing "Yellow Bird" again. Needless to say, we learned a great deal from that experience and have since learned from many other opportunities performing at conventions, arts festivals, performing arts tours, and even performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the Conference Center.</p>
<p>The band went through several transformations as children grew into and out of the band. Ryan now works as a scientist in Salt Lake City, Regan performs with the Army Blues Jazz Big Band in Washington, D.C., and Roger is serving a mission in South Korea. With only Robyn remaining at home, we tried to keep the family band going by hiring some of my colleagues and musical heroes. They are great musicians, and it was a thrill to have them in the band.</p>
<p>At the end of one of our performances, my wife looked at me and said, "This isnt fun anymore. It feels like work." I knew what she meant. Although these newcomers to our band were great musicians, the band had become something more than an ensemble. Our relationship as a family was a part of what made the music happen. We decided that evening to disband the family band.</p>
<p>This experience reminds me of an important scripture: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Our family band served many purposes. It helped our children save for their missions, learn how to work together, develop their self-esteem, and have fun - all while providing a service to others. But this is a plate I no longer spin in my life, and I can channel those energies elsewhere.</p>
<h2><b>Study the Scriptures</b></h2>
<p>Regular study of the scriptures as a family and as individuals has always been a part of our family culture. When our two youngest children, Roger and Robyn, were still preschool age, we each took a turn reading a verse. It was painful to listen to these two read an entire verse of scripture. I would cringe when they had a longer verse to read, but we kept at it. They eventually became great readers, and we learned to better understand the scriptures together.</p>
<p>When Robyn was a senior in high school and the only one left at home, she came to me and said, "Dad, why do we still need to read the scriptures together as a family? You know I love the scriptures, and, according to Elder Eyring, that is the purpose of family scripture study."</p>
<p>I went and found the <i>Ensign</i> and read the article. Sure enough, Elder Henry B. Eyring had said:</p>
<p><i>Its important to read the scriptures together in a way that lets your children know you include them because you love them. However, reading together may break down during the teenage years. Teens may say, "Id rather read on my own." My encouragement to families in that situation is to see that as victory, not defeat. Your child may be saying, "Im getting something when Im alone that I dont get when were all here together." Take that as a wonderful sign that scripture study is beginning to take hold in your teens heart. The main purpose is to fall in love with the scriptures and feast upon them, whether we are alone or together.</i> ["A Discussion on Scripture Study," <i>Ensign,</i> July 2005, 25]</p>
<p>Wow! I had to really alter my thinking. Robyn <i>did</i> love the scriptures and read them every night before retiring to bed. And yet I didnt want to give up that experience because it brought a great spirit into our home. What could we do differently as a family to make our time together more effective for her as well as for us? We counseled together and learned that she wanted help with memorizing her scripture mastery scriptures that year in seminary. She also wanted to read the <i>Preach My Gospel</i> manual that was newly published. We did both. She continued reading scriptures her way in her personal study, and we all learned the scripture mastery scriptures and studied the <i>Preach My Gospel</i> manual together. It was a wonderful experience for all three of us - even though I am a terrible memorizer.</p>
<h2><b>Find Time to Relax</b></h2>
<p>Since my career has also been my favorite hobby, I usually have difficulty taking time off from music-making to exercise, relax, and simply recreate. Often our first family vacations consisted of brief camping trips or visits with family. Too many times I considered tours with musical groups as vacations. It took years for my family to convince me that we needed to just "get away" and have time together without work-related distractions. It has been a conscious effort for me to now plan a family vacation where work is not involved. The memories made and the experiences learned have become priceless. I shudder to think of the opportunities missed when I was so busy spinning unnecessary "music-making plates" in lieu of spending time relaxing with my wife and children.</p>
<h2><b>Family Home Evening</b></h2>
<p>Another family activity we were fairly consistent with was weekly family home evenings. Our Church leaders have taught us over and over again the importance of this weekly event and the ways that it can strengthen us and help us both individually and collectively. I am very grateful for a wife who took every opportunity to teach principles to our children. She didnt wait for Monday night to teach them. When a question was asked, it was a teaching opportunity. When there was a disagreement, it was a teaching opportunity. My father was the first to point this out to me. When he was visiting our home, he took me aside and asked if I had noticed how Ralene had just instructed one of our children. I am sure he asked that question knowing full well that I wasnt even remotely aware of what she had just done.</p>
<p>Growing a garden was an important part of our childrens upbringing. We always included the children in planting, weeding, and harvesting. One lesson that I learned early one Saturday morning from my wife had to do with weeding the garden. The night before we had had a rehearsal with our family band and were working on a new musical number. Ralene had had some difficulty in making her part fit with the rest of the band. She was a bit anxious and would rush some of the rhythmical figures, and it just didnt groove. We stopped to talk about the problem. Many of the children offered their suggestions to help her, but each time we played that part of the tune, she continued to rush. I didnt realize how frustrating this was for her until I asked her a simple question while pulling weeds the next morning in the garden. "Is this a plant or a weed?" I asked, looking at an array of green sprouts.</p>
<p>She stared at me wide-eyed and replied, "You cant tell, can you?"</p>
<p>My response was, "I wouldnt have asked if I knew which of these to pull and which to leave planted."</p>
<p>Then came the teaching moment. "Now you know how I felt last night in rehearsal."</p>
<p>Looking down at the ground, I had no idea which of those little green things to leave in the soil. What a great way to help me understand how she must have felt the night before, doing her best to play her notes but not knowing what to do differently to "make it groove."</p>
<h2><b>Prayer</b></h2>
<p>Elder Ballards final suggestion for us to keep our balance in this world and in the eternal scheme of things is prayer. As a bishop, when I interview youth, I am amazed at how many young people are faithful at saying their personal prayers at night but seldom pray in the morning. When I ask why they choose not to pray in the morning, the excuses vary, but most center on the fact that they get up too late and simply dont have the time. My next question to them is, "When you sin and make mistakes, isnt it more frequently from the time you wake up until you retire at night, or do those things occur more often from the time you fall asleep until you get up in the morning?" They are quick at getting my point.</p>
<p>We need our prayers just as much, if not more, at the start of our day. I can recall periods in my life when I was less consistent with morning personal prayers compared to evening prayers. Inevitably I was asking Heavenly Father in those evening prayers for forgiveness for my many mistakes and shortcomings. When I took the time in the morning to gather my thoughts, plan my day, and pray for His help and guidance, my evening prayers were frequently filled with thanksgiving for the good things that had transpired.</p>
<p>Family prayer is a great way to teach principles and feel love for those with whom we live. There is nothing sweeter than for me to hear my companion pray in my behalf. Hopefully she has similar feelings when I pray for her in our family prayers. Our good neighbor LaDawn Jacob often makes the statement that leaving the house without family prayer is like leaving the house naked.</p>
<p>Prayer is a tool to help us commune with our Father in Heaven. It is also the vehicle He can use to reveal His will to us.</p>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimballs words are direct, but worth our personal reflection:</p>
<p><i>Do you get answers to your prayers? If not, perhaps you did not pay the price. Do you offer a few trite words and worn-out phrases, or do you talk intimately to the Lord? Do you pray occasionally when you should be praying regularly, often, constantly? Do you offer pennies to pay heavy debts when you should give dollars to erase that obligation?</i></p>
<p><i>When you pray, do you just speak, or do you also listen? Your Savior said, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." (Rev. 3:20.) . . .</i></p>
<p><i>. . . The Lord stands knocking. He never retreats. But he will never force himself upon us. If we ever move apart, it is we who move and not the Lord. And should we ever fail to get an answer to our prayers, we must look into our lives for a reason.</i> ["Prayer," <i>New Era,</i> March 1978, 17]</p>
<p>In many of the examples shared today, you may have noticed that frequently I was the one making adjustments. It wasnt enjoyable to admit my lack of financial prowess and to attend those budget meetings with my wife, nor was it always easy or fun trying to make music with my family in our first few attempts to rehearse and perform. The gentle rebuke by my young son regarding his career preference, "caving in" to my daughters desire to memorize scripture mastery scriptures, and pulling weeds in the garden were perhaps uncomfortable situations at first glance that proved to be great blessings in my life, not spineless acts of trying to please. These experiences were shared not to boast, brag, or indict. They were shared because all of us need to make changes.</p>
<p>We can make changes for the better. We fought for that right in the premortal existence. The ability to make choices is what allows us to "come unto Christ," as Moroni so eloquently stated at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon (Moroni 10:30, 32). There are times when we must push forward and not give in, but there are also times when we need to reconsider and alter our direction or approach.</p>
<p>This quote by Elder Neal A. Maxwell has been very helpful to me:</p>
<p><i>I am going to preach a hard doctrine to you now. The submission of ones will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on Gods altar. It is a hard doctrine, but it is true. The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in Gods will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship. There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then weve really given Him the one final thing He asks of us. And the other things are not very, very important. It is the only possession we have that we can give, and there is no lessening of our agency as a result. Instead, what we see is a flowering of our talents and more and more surges of joy.</i> ["Insights from My Life," <i>Ensign,</i> August 2000, 9]</p>
<p>Whether we choose to use all eight suggestions offered by Elder Ballard or follow the advice of any number of experts in the field of "life balance," the important thing to remember is that those of us with the gift of the Holy Ghost need to utilize that gift. Having the gift of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon us is one thing. Having the <i>influence</i> of the Holy Ghost in our lives is another. Submitting our personal will to that of our Father in Heaven allows us to receive much-needed inspiration and revelation. We dont have to be an apostle, Relief Society president, or elders quorum president to have that influence in our lives.</p>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales reinforced this concept as he spoke to us in our last general conference:</p>
<p><i>As faithful children, youth, parents, teachers, and leaders, we may receive personal revelation more frequently than we realize. The more we receive and acknowledge personal revelation, the more our testimonies grow. As a bishop, my testimony grew each time I received revelation to extend callings to ward members. That testimony has been strengthened each time I witness General Authorities and officers, Area Seventies, and stake presidents called or given new assignments. More importantly, I am strengthened by the personal revelations I receive in my role as a son of God, a husband, and a father. I am so thankful for the guidance and direction of the Spirit in our home as we seek for direction in family matters.</i> ["Personal Revelation: The Teachings and Examples of the Prophets," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 88]</p>
<p>Each of us has the ability to receive the direction we need to achieve a balanced life. My hope and prayer is that we will do what we need to do to have the influence of our Father in Heaven in our lives. As we do our part, I testify that He will do His part to bring us eternal life and joy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I feel privileged to be in Provo for the August 2017 commencement exercises of Brigham Young University. My dear wife, Diane, deeply wished that she could be here, but a long-planned family obligation prevented that. Diane and I met on this campus forty-six years ago. I had just returned from my mission to England and was resuming my studies here. Just a few weeks into the fall semester, I was asked by my mission president - who was still in England - to speak at his home ward in Bountiful. I had so recently returned from my mission that perhaps I was uncomfortable without a companion, so I called a young woman in my student ward whom I had seen but never met and asked her to accompany me. That first date turned into a courtship and then an engagement, and last month Diane and I celebrated our forty-fifth wedding anniversary. The year after our marriage we both received degrees from this institution - Diane while almost nine months pregnant. Coming back to where it all began is a profound privilege.
As a member of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees for more than five years, I have regularly been engaged in discussions and decisions about this university. Continually I have been inspired by how deeply the Lord and His prophets care about the youth of the Church and how willing they are to provide enormous sacred resources to assist in temporal and spiritual education. You are blessed to have this university, and it is blessed to have you!
I have great respect for President Kevin J Worthen. Since his appointment three years ago, we have been in board and executive committee meetings twice each month. He has a brilliant mind, he is modest in his leadership style, and he is completely loyal to the Lord and to the leaders of the Lords Church. We are extremely fortunate to have an individual of President Worthens quality leading this university. His complete desire is to do it the Lords way!
Since Diane and I matriculated on this campus four and a half decades ago, it has become more ethnically and culturally diverse, reflecting what has occurred in the Church during this period. We have been to most of the countries and states that you call home. Yes, there are cultural and socioeconomic differences in the places you come from, and that variety is part of the strength of this university; however, do not forget - in the way that matters most - we are all the same. We are all children of the same eternal Father. That understanding is what makes BYU truly special, as it provides the spiritual foundation that gives academic efforts perspective and importance.
To you graduates, I say, "Congratulations!" and "Well done!" However, I emphasize there is a reason this event is called commencement and not conclusion. Yes, it may conclude your formal education, at least on this campus, but it is the beginning of a new season of life. You may fin</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I grew up in the small community of South Ogden, Utah. As boys, my older brother and I lived on our bicycles. We rode our bikes everywhere. With the aid of clothespins, we would attach cards on the bicycle frame next to the spokes so that the snapping sound of the cards would imitate the rumbling sound of a motorcycle engine. At least that was our intention. The more cards the better. They wouldnt last long, and soon we would have to replace them with newer cards.
Other than creating an annoying sound for our neighbors, there was one problem this practice seemed to cause. Some of the spokes began to loosen. Of course my older brother, being 18 months smarter than I, thought he knew exactly what to do: tighten them up. With the help of a special tool we eagerly tightened all the spokes - even the spokes that didnt need tightening. We gave them all an extra tug or two just to be sure they wouldnt loosen again.
Soon we began our first test run of our newly tightened rims and wheels. To our surprise the tires were wobbly and crooked. What we didnt know was that all the spokes needed to be perfectly balanced in tightness to keep the rim and tire straight so they wouldnt rub against the bicycle frame.
Could it be that sometimes our lives are similar to this? Do we have a few loose spokes? Lets review some of our spokes today and see how we are doing in creating a smooth and balanced ride through life.
Spoke Number One: Include Laughter Each Day
I have learned that the ability to find the humor in life, to laugh at everyday family calamities, helps keep life in perspective. If we will learn to laugh and play more with our family and friends, not only will we feel better but so will they.
As Brigham Young put it:
I will take the liberty of suggesting to my brethren who address the congregation that our sermons should be short, and if they are not filled with life and spirit let them be shorter. [JD 12:27]
Sister Hinckley would say concerning her counsel of laughing your way through life: "You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache" (quoted in Virginia H. Pearce, ed., Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999], 107; see also "At Home with the Hinckleys," Ensign, October 2003, 24).
Humor, used with sensitivity, can unite spouses. While I was serving as bishop of a singles ward, an engaged couple asked me if they could have their wedding reception at our house.
I quickly replied, "Of course you can."
I forgot to tell my wife. When she received their wedding invitation a few days before the big event, she happened to notice the address of the reception. When I got home from work she asked me if I had forgotten to tell her something important.
After considerable thought I said, "No, not that I can think of."

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is always a very special experience to be on the campus of this great university and to feel the spirit of so many who are here for the right reason and with the right attitude. Time and time again we hear the comments of groups and individuals who have visited here as an extension of their trip to Church headquarters. Its so reassuring to hear their praise and compliments of the school and the student body and the spirit that they perceive as they walk the halls and the grounds taking careful note of what they experience.
Most every one of these visitors remark that this campus is different. There is a sense of enthusiasm and industry, a sense of respect and determination, a sense of confidence and spirituality - all of which inspires confidence by the visitors, in you the student body, the faculty, and the Church.
That should be reassurance to you of how the world needs a generation of young people who know why they are here and where they are going and the direction they need to take to get there. We commend you.
Today I would like to talk about some things that I hope will be helpful in your lives as students, as spouses, and as parents. I have titled what Ill say "The Importance of Balance."
It has been my experience that balance is sometimes very elusive as we struggle to meet the pressures and challenges that are ever present. So I hope I can share some thoughts that will be useful in the challenging experience we call life. I think of the definition someone coined: "Life is what happens while you are making other plans."
First may I congratulate you on meeting the academic, citizenship, and moral requirements to gain admission here - you have instant credibility with me. Not that you wont be required to continue to verify those requirements as you pursue your education. Of course you will, but it should make you feel good just knowing that you made the team.
I commend you for having exhibited the mental and physical discipline that brings you to this point in your life. No doubt you realize the importance by now of maintaining that discipline in both the academic and moral aspects of your lives. As you continue to make the right choices, you will have tremendous opportunities for continued growth and development.
It is so sad to see poor choices being made at critical times, choices that have very seriously limited the options a person has for future opportunity. No doubt you will continue to see the "poor-choices" factor operating all the days of your life. Consider it ongoing evidence for you to make good choices and to be consciously striving to improve yourself each day.
I recall a motivational speaker during my teenage years making the statement, "I know of no one to be pitied more than one whose future is in the past." What a sobering thought - bad choices seriously compromising opportunities of the future.
So if you are tempted to take tha</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">There are many in society who are concerned only with single interests, who judge the merits of candidates and causes on the basis of those single issues. In the Church some have been concerned with one principle or one phase of the gospel over all others. With this background, I have chosen to speak today of the need for a good balance in our lives.
The wise Job said: "Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity" (Job 31:6).
As we employ the even balance, so also we shall be judged, for the measure we judge by comes back to judge us.
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. [Matthew 7: 1, 21]
Protest Off-balance
There seem to have been many in the last generation whose lives were spent protesting. Perhaps they wanted to do so because they felt repressed or wished to bring about change or perhaps had selfish reasons, thinking that if they tore the house down they might end up with a shingle. Some protesters have said that they did what they did in order to be free - free of traditions, free of morals, free of all of the confining standards of society, unrestrained by government or law. Some have been wildly self-indulgent. Having traveled far down this road, they have found that it is not the road to freedom, but to slavery - as Harry Emerson Fosdick noted, with "habits that bind them, diseases that curse them, and blasted reputations that ruin them" (Christianity: Repression or Liberation?).
Fortunately, most of your generation have escaped this disaster, but there are few who have not been exposed to this philosophy. As a result, the balance in their lives has been somewhat tilted and uneven. Many in society, and even some in this university, expend far too much precious energy in protesting the rules. Since they did not make the rules, some feel that they should not be restricted by them. Others make a game of testing the fences to see what they can get away with. Some think that by breaking the rules somehow they become stronger or more independent. Those who fight the rules spend much time and energy trying to express independence in their attempted quest to find some identity.
Talents, gifts of expression, and precious time are exhausted in swimming against too many tides. I have no hesitancy to suggest that young men at this university can learn to express themselves better through excellence in the classroom or on the playing field than in the length of their hair. Young ladies can obtain a better identity and receive a better notice by their academic excellence and artistic expression rather than through immode</span>
