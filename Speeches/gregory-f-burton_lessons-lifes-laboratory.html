  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="As a scientist, I make observations that help me develop explanations for what I see in the laboratory. These explanations are called hypotheses, and they can be tested in the laboratory to determine whether or not they are true. An example of a hypothesis that I might make is "because chemicals A and B are known to be reactive, I reason, or hypothesize, that if A and B are mixed together, they will react and form product C."

One of the first challenges that we as scientists face in testing our hypotheses is to determine the "definitive test," or the analysis that allows us to unequivocally establish whether or not our hypothesis is correct.

While many times our hypotheses can be simply stated, actually testing whether or not our expected outcomes materialize can be tricky.

Let me give you an example of a simple experiment. If I mix solutions A and B - both of which are clear but reactive - I predict, or hypothesize, that when they are mixed, they will form product C, which is colored. Lets watch this experiment.

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zL1sUnljNHY&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Here we have clear solution A, in which we pour solution B. Product C, which is dark colored, eventually develops.

As we saw, product C was dark blue, and thus its presence was quite easy to detect. But did you notice that there was a time element involved in this test? If we only watched for the first seven or eight seconds, we would not have seen the colored product C and would have erroneously concluded that the prediction was incorrect. The take-home message from this experiment is that in order to really test the prediction we had to be willing to wait long enough for things to happen. Stated differently, we needed a degree of patience.

Another frequent outcome of scientific experiments is that they dont always work as we expect.

Let me show you another experiment that illustrates this principle. In this example were going to watch as an ice cube is placed on top of some gray powder. Based upon previous experiences of mixing water with such powders, you might suppose that well get a pile of damp gray powder or gray mud.

Lets do the experiment and see what happens. I should caution you that this is not one that you want to do at home!

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK6PFN_tPj4&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Here is our gray powder, and here is the ice cube. The powder explodes and burns.

I suspect thats not the outcome you were predicting, and you may have been surprised by what you saw. While these types of experiments have surprising conclusions, such outcomes can be truly enlightening because they lead us to think more deeply and often generate important new understanding and knowledge. However, they can also be discouraging because we dont immediately understand what has happened. In this case we may give up and, in doing so, fail to gain the understanding and new knowledge that we could have received.

The reason that I have taken time to discuss how scientists learn in their laboratories is that I believe there are similarities between how and what we as scientists learn in our laboratories and how and what we as brothers and sisters in the gospel learn from the experiences of our lives. I would even go a step further and suggest that the process of learning that each of us undergoes in our lives might be described as "learning in lifes laboratory."

How is it that learning in lifes lab and learning in the science lab are similar?

We as brothers and sisters experience situations in life and try to understand them in the context of what we know and what we have previously experienced. While we dont often make formal hypotheses, we do try to understand the meaning of our experiences and to learn and grow from them.

Just as in the experiment with the ice cube and the gray powder, sometimes what we experience is not what we expect or predict or even desire. Another way of saying this is that "sometimes our lives simply dont go as we plan."

Applying this to life as a college student, examples of things not going as planned might include a low exam score after hours of studying or a relationship that just doesnt turn out as we hoped or a disappointing response to applications to graduate or professional schools or for work.

Just as we have seen in the science lab, these unplanned and unexpected results in lifes laboratory can be at times confusing, frustrating, and discouraging.

Today I would like to share three lessons that I have learned from the experiences from my life. I do so with the sincere hope that these lessons might in some way be helpful to you.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lesson of the Green Table&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The first lesson that I would like to share is one I call the Lesson of the Green Table.

In my bedroom as a child there was a small, green table. There wasnt anything special about this green table, other than the fact that I played on it frequently. One of my treasured possessions as a young boy was a genuine cavalry fort and soldier set from a classic American TV adventure program entitled &lt;i&gt;Rin Tin Tin.&lt;/i&gt;

During the day I would get out the &lt;i&gt;Rin Tin Tin&lt;/i&gt; set and line up the toy soldiers and their horses on the green table. In my imagination I would send the cavalry troops out on exciting adventures to rescue the innocent from some impending disaster. As a young boy, it just didnt get much better than that.

At the end of the day I would put away my toys, and the green table became the place where my parents and I would meet as they taught me to pray. I remember vividly my mother or father or both coming into my room and teaching me to kneel down by the green table and say my prayers. I dont remember much about those simple prayers, but I suspect they contained my thanks for my toys, my love for my family members, and some simple requests for things that seemed important to me at the time.

And yet this was one of the great training events in my life.

As a result of this training and experience, I dont ever remember questioning whether my Heavenly Father was on the other end of my prayers. I didnt think this belief was particularly unusual until I spoke with some of my friends who didnt share my beliefs. As the years went by, the green table and my toys eventually disappeared, but my prayers and my faith that they would be answered did not disappear.

Many of my prayers were undoubtedly for trivial things, but as I grew and gained more experience, my prayers became highly focused and intensely sincere as I pled for help with the challenges of my life.

One day when I was probably about eight to ten years of age, I came home on a Saturday afternoon to find my father outside our home, wandering about in a dazed and not very coherent manner. I had never seen my father like this before, and I became genuinely worried about him. I went to get help, and we were able to get my dad into bed and call the doctor. While we waited for the doctor to come and help my father, we investigated and found a ladder tipped over the steep stairs that led down to our basement. We surmised that my dad had been trying to change the light bulb over the stairway and, in the process, had fallen from the ladder onto the long row of stairs that went to our basement. This apparent fall had left him in a state that I had never witnessed before. This was a crisis in my young life, for I had no idea whether my dads injury was truly serious or not.

Based on my previous experiences at the green table, I went into my room, where I knelt and pled with my Father in Heaven to help my earthly father to be all right. As with previous prayers, my Heavenly Father answered my plea for help, and my earthly father recovered nicely. This and a number of other experiences with prayer helped me to develop great trust and faith in my Father in Heaven and in prayer.

While the childhood experiences are long since gone, lifes challenging experiences continue. When I was your age, I was intent on going to medical school. My life was planned around this goal. As often as I could, I went to hospitals to shadow physicians I knew, and I worked in a clinical laboratory to gain experience. Just as it is now, getting into medical school in my day was intensely competitive. I made this goal a matter of sincere prayer, asking for the help that I needed to accomplish my goal.

I applied to medical schools several times and kept praying for success. After many months and nothing but rejection letters, an answer to my prayers was received. The answer that came into my mind was a very distinctive impression that "all would work out well," and it was accompanied by an intense feeling of peace. This made me feel good, and I interpreted this answer to my prayer as meaning that I would be accepted into medical school and live happily ever after.

But this was not to be. No acceptance letters came after months of trying, and it became time for me to graduate. I ended up working for a few years while I struggled to figure out what to do with my life that wasnt going as planned. I decided that if I couldnt go to medical school, I needed to move on and make a new plan for a career. Because I loved the sciences - immunology in particular, which is the study of the bodys immune system - I decided to continue my education in this subject. My wife, Ann, and I did what was needed to make this new goal a reality. She sacrificed greatly for me to be able to go back to school for masters and doctoral degrees and a postdoctoral fellowship - some nine and a half years of additional education that took us from coast to coast. The long and the short of this story is that "everything did indeed work out," just as the answer to my prayers had indicated, even though it didnt work out in the way that I initially had anticipated or in the time frame that I had expected.

As I look back upon my life, great blessings have come to us because I didnt go to medical school. I am involved in a career that I absolutely love, and it has brought great blessings, wonderful people, and fascinating experiences into my life.

I suspect that there are those in the audience today for whom life will not work out as you plan or expect or anticipate. For example, you also may not be able to do what you always planned on doing, or challenges may occur that you didnt anticipate.

The concrete lesson that the green table experience has taught me is that we have a loving and kind Heavenly Father who answers our prayers and who will help us in our lives. I have also learned that what is important to me also seems important enough to my Heavenly Father that He will listen and answer in a way that is truly best for me, just as He will answer in the way that is best for you.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lesson of the Berlin Wall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The second lesson that I would like to share is what I call the Lesson of the Berlin Wall.

In August 1989 I was able to visit Berlin to attend a world conference on immunology. This was a very special event for me for a number of reasons that were not all related to science. I was raised in a family of German missionaries. My father and brother, my aunt and uncle, and my cousins had served missions in Germany and spoke with great love for the country and its people. This was also a moving time for me because my German missionary father had passed away a few months prior to this conference.

My uncle and aunt, who had spent a considerable portion of their lives serving in Church callings in Germany, knew that this was a tender time for me, and they were gracious enough to contact their friend, Dieter Berndt, in Berlin to see if there were any possibility that I could stay with him during my short visit. Brother Berndt graciously invited me to stay at his home, and I had the opportunity of a lifetime to interact with him and his family in a city that my father had served in.

At the time of my visit Berlin was a divided city due to the presence of the Berlin Wall, which was erected in August 1961.

[Image of the Berlin Wall shown.] This is a snapshot of the Berlin Wall that doesnt show the barbed wire, the armed guards, or the gloom that was associated with this wall. However, it clearly shows the division that it brought about in the city of Berlin.

This wall broke Berlin into the free western portion and the communist eastern one. Two separate governments ruled the city, and each had a very different philosophy about life and personal freedom. I had the opportunity to visit East Berlin while I was there, and I found it as different from West Berlin as a black-and-white image is different from a color photograph.

One rainy night Brother Berndt took me out for a tour of West Berlin. As we traveled along the wall that separated philosophies, governments, and families, he pointed out that there were places with white crosses painted on the Wall or adjacent to it. He explained to me that these crosses represented memorials to those who had lost their lives as they tried to escape the captivity of East Berlin into free West Berlin.

As we drove along I asked Brother Berndt if he thought the Wall would ever come down.

Now, to appreciate his answer, you have to understand who Brother Berndt was in terms of his background. Here was a man who had his feet in both church and university circles; he was educated in both spiritual and secular things. If anyone might give a valid prediction of the Walls future, it was Brother Berndt.

Now to his answer to my question about the Wall coming down: he turned to me and stated, "No, it cant come down." He went on to explain that economically it made no sense and that it just couldnt occur because the governments would not allow it to do so.

Well, for those of you who are not familiar with the rest of the story of the Wall, some eight to twelve weeks after my conference concluded, I was back home in Virginia glued to our TV, watching as the dismantling of the Berlin Wall was taking place. Thus the wall that could never come down was being taken apart before my eyes! I believe that this happened because the Lord was ready for it to come down to further His purposes.

What is the lesson that this experience taught me? Events can and do occur in our lives that are unexpected and, often, on a timetable that is not our own. Whether different than expected or faster or slower than anticipated, the Lord works on His own time schedule and in His own way.

In the case of the Berlin Wall, there was not a hint of its coming down when I was there - not even to a leader in the Church with years of education and experience in the secular world.

It is important to note in the case of the Berlin Wall that the time frame of its coming down was much more rapid than anyone might have conceived.

In contrast, there are many instances when the Lords time schedule is much longer than what we might predict or desire. I think this latter situation is reflected in the phrase "learning to wait upon the Lord."

I have experienced, as I suspect you have, prayers to which answers seem to be long in coming. Nevertheless, my experiences in life have taught me with assurance that the answers do and will come.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lesson of the Saviors Power to Heal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third lesson that I have learned through my experiences in lifes laboratory is one that gives me constant hope. It has been taught to me through my own experiences and through the experiences of others. It is tightly linked to the other two lessons that I have shared.

This third lesson is that the healing power of the Savior is real and that it can touch our lives.

The all-encompassing nature of the Saviors power to heal is taught in many places within the scriptures. One of my favorite places is in the Book of Mormon in 1 Nephi, when Nephi saw the vision of the tree of life and was shown the life, mission, and sacrifice of the Son of God. Let me read from 1 Nephi 11:31:

&lt;i&gt;I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits. . . . And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.&lt;/i&gt;

As I have pondered this scripture, I have marveled at the Saviors love and His efforts to heal us.

I am first struck with the observation that the Savior was not distant from those whom He healed. In point of fact, He was "among" them. His healing act was personal. I am amazed that among all the creations so extensive that they cannot be numbered by man, the Lord knows us as individuals.

The second message that this scripture brings to my mind is the depth and variety of challenges and problems that the Savior dealt with. It appears to me from my reading of this scripture that His healing capacity was not limited to healing physical illness, as those who came to the Him had "all manner of disease," which sounds all-encompassing. This scripture, when coupled with lifes experiences, teaches me that He can heal even the maladies of our souls.

As I consider my life, there are times when I am in need of that healing that comes only from Him. Perhaps you, too, have felt this need in your lives.

Because I have felt His healing power in my life and in my familys lives, I have learned that He who is our Savior is the friend of the comfortless and of those who are having problems - whether they are problems with classes, with dating, or with any of the other significant challenges that specifically trouble you and trouble me.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Silver Lining&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The message that I have endeavored to share today is that lifes experiential laboratory has been a wonderful teacher. The learning process for me has not been easy - just as I suspect it has not been for you. Three important lessons that I have learned in lifes laboratory are:

1. That prayer is real and that the Lord is not only accessible to us but He is a God of miracles. I have come to know through the experiences of my life that He is interested in us and what is important in our lives.

2. That the timetable of the Lord is different than our own and that it can be either quicker or slower than what we might expect. This observation leads me to understand that we must learn to "wait upon the Lord."

3. And, finally, the Lord knows us as individuals, and He can lift us and heal us.

Now, just as I began this talk with a science experiment, I would like to end it with one. This experiment illustrates the most important lesson I have learned in my life.

Let me describe to you what you are about to see. I will preface this description with the suggestion that what you will see is, in my view, a metaphor of the testing that goes on in lifes laboratory.

You will see two colorless liquids mixed together. I would like you to pay careful attention to what you then see. Look for three color changes to occur: change 1, from clear to dark; change 2, from dark to a muddy but lighter brown; and change 3, from muddy brown to, well, lets watch and see.

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oSimsVRcak&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Two colorless liquids are mixed together. Look for the color changes. You can see the darkness coming in. Then it begins to lighten. And at last we have a beautiful silver lining to the vessel.

What do these stages of this reaction suggest to me?

1. The mixture started out as clear - much as our lives do when everything is going well.

2. It then became very dark - almost black - similar to the storms that come into our lives. These storms may consist of low exam scores, personal relationship problems, failure to meet a goal, or feeling all alone with great personal struggles.

3. The dark then lightened and became a muddy brown color - similar to the storms passing and things seeming a bit better; yet we continue, perhaps, to still feel confused or be in need of further help.

4. Lastly, the brown color gave way to shining silver - the "silver lining" at the end of the trials.

It is important to note that the silver lining comes when we gain understanding and the Saviors influence and love enter our lives. Youll note that this didnt occur until after the dark period had already transpired.

In a beautiful scripture in the book of Revelation, the Savior referred to Himself as "the bright and morning star" (22:16). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once taught that after the "long night of darkness" comes the morning and "the bright and morning star," or the influence, love, power, and peace of the Savior (from the Saturday evening session of a stake conference in the Orem, Utah, Cascade Stake, 2007). It is this influence in our lives that is the quiet after the storm and the peace that exceeds all understanding. He is the silver lining to our lives. He is the Bright and Morning Star.

The experiences of my life, a few of which I have shared today, logically teach me of a loving Heavenly Father and Savior who are vitally interested in us.

However, and far more important than logic, is the witness of the Holy Ghost that allows me to testify that we have a living Heavenly Father who loves us and is vitally interested in and concerned about us.

Furthermore, His divine Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior, and through His atoning sacrifice we can be lifted, healed, and redeemed.

I bear witness of these things and the ultimate peace, light, and life that come from the Savior, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>As a scientist, I make observations that help me develop explanations for what I see in the laboratory. These explanations are called hypotheses, and they can be tested in the laboratory to determine whether or not they are true. An example of a hypothesis that I might make is "because chemicals A and B are known to be reactive, I reason, or hypothesize, that if A and B are mixed together, they will react and form product C."</p>
<p>One of the first challenges that we as scientists face in testing our hypotheses is to determine the "definitive test," or the analysis that allows us to unequivocally establish whether or not our hypothesis is correct.</p>
<p>While many times our hypotheses can be simply stated, actually testing whether or not our expected outcomes materialize can be tricky.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of a simple experiment. If I mix solutions A and B - both of which are clear but reactive - I predict, or hypothesize, that when they are mixed, they will form product C, which is colored. Lets watch this experiment.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zL1sUnljNHY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here we have clear solution A, in which we pour solution B. Product C, which is dark colored, eventually develops.</p>
<p>As we saw, product C was dark blue, and thus its presence was quite easy to detect. But did you notice that there was a time element involved in this test? If we only watched for the first seven or eight seconds, we would not have seen the colored product C and would have erroneously concluded that the prediction was incorrect. The take-home message from this experiment is that in order to really test the prediction we had to be willing to wait long enough for things to happen. Stated differently, we needed a degree of patience.</p>
<p>Another frequent outcome of scientific experiments is that they dont always work as we expect.</p>
<p>Let me show you another experiment that illustrates this principle. In this example were going to watch as an ice cube is placed on top of some gray powder. Based upon previous experiences of mixing water with such powders, you might suppose that well get a pile of damp gray powder or gray mud.</p>
<p>Lets do the experiment and see what happens. I should caution you that this is not one that you want to do at home!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK6PFN_tPj4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here is our gray powder, and here is the ice cube. The powder explodes and burns.</p>
<p>I suspect thats not the outcome you were predicting, and you may have been surprised by what you saw. While these types of experiments have surprising conclusions, such outcomes can be truly enlightening because they lead us to think more deeply and often generate important new understanding and knowledge. However, they can also be discouraging because we dont immediately understand what has happened. In this case we may give up and, in doing so, fail to gain the understanding and new knowledge that we could have received.</p>
<p>The reason that I have taken time to discuss how scientists learn in their laboratories is that I believe there are similarities between how and what we as scientists learn in our laboratories and how and what we as brothers and sisters in the gospel learn from the experiences of our lives. I would even go a step further and suggest that the process of learning that each of us undergoes in our lives might be described as "learning in lifes laboratory."</p>
<p>How is it that learning in lifes lab and learning in the science lab are similar?</p>
<p>We as brothers and sisters experience situations in life and try to understand them in the context of what we know and what we have previously experienced. While we dont often make formal hypotheses, we do try to understand the meaning of our experiences and to learn and grow from them.</p>
<p>Just as in the experiment with the ice cube and the gray powder, sometimes what we experience is not what we expect or predict or even desire. Another way of saying this is that "sometimes our lives simply dont go as we plan."</p>
<p>Applying this to life as a college student, examples of things not going as planned might include a low exam score after hours of studying or a relationship that just doesnt turn out as we hoped or a disappointing response to applications to graduate or professional schools or for work.</p>
<p>Just as we have seen in the science lab, these unplanned and unexpected results in lifes laboratory can be at times confusing, frustrating, and discouraging.</p>
<p>Today I would like to share three lessons that I have learned from the experiences from my life. I do so with the sincere hope that these lessons might in some way be helpful to you.</p>
<h2><b>The Lesson of the Green Table</b></h2>
<p>The first lesson that I would like to share is one I call the Lesson of the Green Table.</p>
<p>In my bedroom as a child there was a small, green table. There wasnt anything special about this green table, other than the fact that I played on it frequently. One of my treasured possessions as a young boy was a genuine cavalry fort and soldier set from a classic American TV adventure program entitled <i>Rin Tin Tin.</i></p>
<p>During the day I would get out the <i>Rin Tin Tin</i> set and line up the toy soldiers and their horses on the green table. In my imagination I would send the cavalry troops out on exciting adventures to rescue the innocent from some impending disaster. As a young boy, it just didnt get much better than that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I would put away my toys, and the green table became the place where my parents and I would meet as they taught me to pray. I remember vividly my mother or father or both coming into my room and teaching me to kneel down by the green table and say my prayers. I dont remember much about those simple prayers, but I suspect they contained my thanks for my toys, my love for my family members, and some simple requests for things that seemed important to me at the time.</p>
<p>And yet this was one of the great training events in my life.</p>
<p>As a result of this training and experience, I dont ever remember questioning whether my Heavenly Father was on the other end of my prayers. I didnt think this belief was particularly unusual until I spoke with some of my friends who didnt share my beliefs. As the years went by, the green table and my toys eventually disappeared, but my prayers and my faith that they would be answered did not disappear.</p>
<p>Many of my prayers were undoubtedly for trivial things, but as I grew and gained more experience, my prayers became highly focused and intensely sincere as I pled for help with the challenges of my life.</p>
<p>One day when I was probably about eight to ten years of age, I came home on a Saturday afternoon to find my father outside our home, wandering about in a dazed and not very coherent manner. I had never seen my father like this before, and I became genuinely worried about him. I went to get help, and we were able to get my dad into bed and call the doctor. While we waited for the doctor to come and help my father, we investigated and found a ladder tipped over the steep stairs that led down to our basement. We surmised that my dad had been trying to change the light bulb over the stairway and, in the process, had fallen from the ladder onto the long row of stairs that went to our basement. This apparent fall had left him in a state that I had never witnessed before. This was a crisis in my young life, for I had no idea whether my dads injury was truly serious or not.</p>
<p>Based on my previous experiences at the green table, I went into my room, where I knelt and pled with my Father in Heaven to help my earthly father to be all right. As with previous prayers, my Heavenly Father answered my plea for help, and my earthly father recovered nicely. This and a number of other experiences with prayer helped me to develop great trust and faith in my Father in Heaven and in prayer.</p>
<p>While the childhood experiences are long since gone, lifes challenging experiences continue. When I was your age, I was intent on going to medical school. My life was planned around this goal. As often as I could, I went to hospitals to shadow physicians I knew, and I worked in a clinical laboratory to gain experience. Just as it is now, getting into medical school in my day was intensely competitive. I made this goal a matter of sincere prayer, asking for the help that I needed to accomplish my goal.</p>
<p>I applied to medical schools several times and kept praying for success. After many months and nothing but rejection letters, an answer to my prayers was received. The answer that came into my mind was a very distinctive impression that "all would work out well," and it was accompanied by an intense feeling of peace. This made me feel good, and I interpreted this answer to my prayer as meaning that I would be accepted into medical school and live happily ever after.</p>
<p>But this was not to be. No acceptance letters came after months of trying, and it became time for me to graduate. I ended up working for a few years while I struggled to figure out what to do with my life that wasnt going as planned. I decided that if I couldnt go to medical school, I needed to move on and make a new plan for a career. Because I loved the sciences - immunology in particular, which is the study of the bodys immune system - I decided to continue my education in this subject. My wife, Ann, and I did what was needed to make this new goal a reality. She sacrificed greatly for me to be able to go back to school for masters and doctoral degrees and a postdoctoral fellowship - some nine and a half years of additional education that took us from coast to coast. The long and the short of this story is that "everything did indeed work out," just as the answer to my prayers had indicated, even though it didnt work out in the way that I initially had anticipated or in the time frame that I had expected.</p>
<p>As I look back upon my life, great blessings have come to us because I didnt go to medical school. I am involved in a career that I absolutely love, and it has brought great blessings, wonderful people, and fascinating experiences into my life.</p>
<p>I suspect that there are those in the audience today for whom life will not work out as you plan or expect or anticipate. For example, you also may not be able to do what you always planned on doing, or challenges may occur that you didnt anticipate.</p>
<p>The concrete lesson that the green table experience has taught me is that we have a loving and kind Heavenly Father who answers our prayers and who will help us in our lives. I have also learned that what is important to me also seems important enough to my Heavenly Father that He will listen and answer in a way that is truly best for me, just as He will answer in the way that is best for you.</p>
<h2><b>The Lesson of the Berlin Wall</b></h2>
<p>The second lesson that I would like to share is what I call the Lesson of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>In August 1989 I was able to visit Berlin to attend a world conference on immunology. This was a very special event for me for a number of reasons that were not all related to science. I was raised in a family of German missionaries. My father and brother, my aunt and uncle, and my cousins had served missions in Germany and spoke with great love for the country and its people. This was also a moving time for me because my German missionary father had passed away a few months prior to this conference.</p>
<p>My uncle and aunt, who had spent a considerable portion of their lives serving in Church callings in Germany, knew that this was a tender time for me, and they were gracious enough to contact their friend, Dieter Berndt, in Berlin to see if there were any possibility that I could stay with him during my short visit. Brother Berndt graciously invited me to stay at his home, and I had the opportunity of a lifetime to interact with him and his family in a city that my father had served in.</p>
<p>At the time of my visit Berlin was a divided city due to the presence of the Berlin Wall, which was erected in August 1961.</p>
<p>[Image of the Berlin Wall shown.] This is a snapshot of the Berlin Wall that doesnt show the barbed wire, the armed guards, or the gloom that was associated with this wall. However, it clearly shows the division that it brought about in the city of Berlin.</p>
<p>This wall broke Berlin into the free western portion and the communist eastern one. Two separate governments ruled the city, and each had a very different philosophy about life and personal freedom. I had the opportunity to visit East Berlin while I was there, and I found it as different from West Berlin as a black-and-white image is different from a color photograph.</p>
<p>One rainy night Brother Berndt took me out for a tour of West Berlin. As we traveled along the wall that separated philosophies, governments, and families, he pointed out that there were places with white crosses painted on the Wall or adjacent to it. He explained to me that these crosses represented memorials to those who had lost their lives as they tried to escape the captivity of East Berlin into free West Berlin.</p>
<p>As we drove along I asked Brother Berndt if he thought the Wall would ever come down.</p>
<p>Now, to appreciate his answer, you have to understand who Brother Berndt was in terms of his background. Here was a man who had his feet in both church and university circles; he was educated in both spiritual and secular things. If anyone might give a valid prediction of the Walls future, it was Brother Berndt.</p>
<p>Now to his answer to my question about the Wall coming down: he turned to me and stated, "No, it cant come down." He went on to explain that economically it made no sense and that it just couldnt occur because the governments would not allow it to do so.</p>
<p>Well, for those of you who are not familiar with the rest of the story of the Wall, some eight to twelve weeks after my conference concluded, I was back home in Virginia glued to our TV, watching as the dismantling of the Berlin Wall was taking place. Thus the wall that could never come down was being taken apart before my eyes! I believe that this happened because the Lord was ready for it to come down to further His purposes.</p>
<p>What is the lesson that this experience taught me? Events can and do occur in our lives that are unexpected and, often, on a timetable that is not our own. Whether different than expected or faster or slower than anticipated, the Lord works on His own time schedule and in His own way.</p>
<p>In the case of the Berlin Wall, there was not a hint of its coming down when I was there - not even to a leader in the Church with years of education and experience in the secular world.</p>
<p>It is important to note in the case of the Berlin Wall that the time frame of its coming down was much more rapid than anyone might have conceived.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are many instances when the Lords time schedule is much longer than what we might predict or desire. I think this latter situation is reflected in the phrase "learning to wait upon the Lord."</p>
<p>I have experienced, as I suspect you have, prayers to which answers seem to be long in coming. Nevertheless, my experiences in life have taught me with assurance that the answers do and will come.</p>
<h2><b>The Lesson of the Saviors Power to Heal</b></h2>
<p>The third lesson that I have learned through my experiences in lifes laboratory is one that gives me constant hope. It has been taught to me through my own experiences and through the experiences of others. It is tightly linked to the other two lessons that I have shared.</p>
<p>This third lesson is that the healing power of the Savior is real and that it can touch our lives.</p>
<p>The all-encompassing nature of the Saviors power to heal is taught in many places within the scriptures. One of my favorite places is in the Book of Mormon in 1 Nephi, when Nephi saw the vision of the tree of life and was shown the life, mission, and sacrifice of the Son of God. Let me read from 1 Nephi 11:31:</p>
<p><i>I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits. . . . And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</i></p>
<p>As I have pondered this scripture, I have marveled at the Saviors love and His efforts to heal us.</p>
<p>I am first struck with the observation that the Savior was not distant from those whom He healed. In point of fact, He was "among" them. His healing act was personal. I am amazed that among all the creations so extensive that they cannot be numbered by man, the Lord knows us as individuals.</p>
<p>The second message that this scripture brings to my mind is the depth and variety of challenges and problems that the Savior dealt with. It appears to me from my reading of this scripture that His healing capacity was not limited to healing physical illness, as those who came to the Him had "all manner of disease," which sounds all-encompassing. This scripture, when coupled with lifes experiences, teaches me that He can heal even the maladies of our souls.</p>
<p>As I consider my life, there are times when I am in need of that healing that comes only from Him. Perhaps you, too, have felt this need in your lives.</p>
<p>Because I have felt His healing power in my life and in my familys lives, I have learned that He who is our Savior is the friend of the comfortless and of those who are having problems - whether they are problems with classes, with dating, or with any of the other significant challenges that specifically trouble you and trouble me.</p>
<h2><b>The Silver Lining</b></h2>
<p>The message that I have endeavored to share today is that lifes experiential laboratory has been a wonderful teacher. The learning process for me has not been easy - just as I suspect it has not been for you. Three important lessons that I have learned in lifes laboratory are:</p>
<p>1. That prayer is real and that the Lord is not only accessible to us but He is a God of miracles. I have come to know through the experiences of my life that He is interested in us and what is important in our lives.</p>
<p>2. That the timetable of the Lord is different than our own and that it can be either quicker or slower than what we might expect. This observation leads me to understand that we must learn to "wait upon the Lord."</p>
<p>3. And, finally, the Lord knows us as individuals, and He can lift us and heal us.</p>
<p>Now, just as I began this talk with a science experiment, I would like to end it with one. This experiment illustrates the most important lesson I have learned in my life.</p>
<p>Let me describe to you what you are about to see. I will preface this description with the suggestion that what you will see is, in my view, a metaphor of the testing that goes on in lifes laboratory.</p>
<p>You will see two colorless liquids mixed together. I would like you to pay careful attention to what you then see. Look for three color changes to occur: change 1, from clear to dark; change 2, from dark to a muddy but lighter brown; and change 3, from muddy brown to, well, lets watch and see.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oSimsVRcak" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Two colorless liquids are mixed together. Look for the color changes. You can see the darkness coming in. Then it begins to lighten. And at last we have a beautiful silver lining to the vessel.</p>
<p>What do these stages of this reaction suggest to me?</p>
<p>1. The mixture started out as clear - much as our lives do when everything is going well.</p>
<p>2. It then became very dark - almost black - similar to the storms that come into our lives. These storms may consist of low exam scores, personal relationship problems, failure to meet a goal, or feeling all alone with great personal struggles.</p>
<p>3. The dark then lightened and became a muddy brown color - similar to the storms passing and things seeming a bit better; yet we continue, perhaps, to still feel confused or be in need of further help.</p>
<p>4. Lastly, the brown color gave way to shining silver - the "silver lining" at the end of the trials.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the silver lining comes when we gain understanding and the Saviors influence and love enter our lives. Youll note that this didnt occur until after the dark period had already transpired.</p>
<p>In a beautiful scripture in the book of Revelation, the Savior referred to Himself as "the bright and morning star" (22:16). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once taught that after the "long night of darkness" comes the morning and "the bright and morning star," or the influence, love, power, and peace of the Savior (from the Saturday evening session of a stake conference in the Orem, Utah, Cascade Stake, 2007). It is this influence in our lives that is the quiet after the storm and the peace that exceeds all understanding. He is the silver lining to our lives. He is the Bright and Morning Star.</p>
<p>The experiences of my life, a few of which I have shared today, logically teach me of a loving Heavenly Father and Savior who are vitally interested in us.</p>
<p>However, and far more important than logic, is the witness of the Holy Ghost that allows me to testify that we have a living Heavenly Father who loves us and is vitally interested in and concerned about us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, His divine Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior, and through His atoning sacrifice we can be lifted, healed, and redeemed.</p>
<p>I bear witness of these things and the ultimate peace, light, and life that come from the Savior, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Internationally, BYU is known as "the language university." The 2017 edition of the pamphlet Y Facts reported that approximately 65 percent of BYU students speak more than one language.
Let me do a quick survey to see if those assembled here today are representative of BYU students in general. If you know more than one language, please raise your hand. [The majority of the audience raised their hand.]
I hope you realize how extraordinary it is that you have been given the gift of being able to communicate in more than one language. Think about it: language is the most complex of all human behaviors, and most of you can communicate in more than one language.
The Complexity of Language
Since we can all read English, I would like to demonstrate the complexity of language by giving you a simple English test. How would you read "St. Paul St." aloud?
You probably said, "Saint Paul Street." And your response to this simple task was likely not only correct but automatic. But can you explain to another person the rule for determining what the abbreviation "St." stands for? Perhaps you would say that "St." before a noun is an abbreviation for "saint," and "St." after a noun is an abbreviation for "street."
Now test your rule on the following street sign, which I saw near Disneyland in California: "St. College St."
Oops, there is no saint named College! However, there is a state college, so we will have to refine our rule for pronouncing the abbreviation "St."
Yes, even simple language is complex. Language is so complex that we are often hard pressed to explain how it operates. Yet we are generally unaware of how complex language is. In some ways language is like the air we breathe: we dont pay attention to it - unless there is something wrong with it.
Because people dont pay attention to language unless there is something wrong with it, you should not take compliments about your language skills too seriously. The fact that someone complimented you on your language is an indication that they noticed it - and that happens when there is something wrong with it.
Early in my mission in Austria, I was quite confident of my German language ability. In fact, several members had told me how well I spoke German. Then one Sunday after I said a prayer in sacrament meeting, I overheard some members commenting on my language skills.
One sister offered the critique, "War das nicht lieb? Genau wie ein kleines Kind!" Which means, "Wasnt that sweet? Just like a little child!"
The sister who made the comment was too kind to ever provide that honest feedback to me personally, so I was grateful that I had overheard the comment she had made to others. Her candid assessment let me know that I needed to improve my language skills.
Another mission experience taught me how complicated it is to translat</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">You may wonder, as we gather to recognize and celebrate the end of your university career, why we hold a ceremony that we call a commencement. A commencement is, after all, a beginning, not an end. Some may conclude that this apparent misnomer occurs because university administrators, who organize and name such events, are often so confused that they are never sure whether they are coming or going or beginning or ending. That may be true. However, there are other explanations for this seeming contradiction.
We celebrate the final act of your university education with a commencement ceremony in part to impress upon you the need for perspective. Whether something is a beginning or an ending depends, in large measure, on the perspective from which things are viewed. A newly married couple - reflecting on the hectic events of the wedding day and all the details and planning that led up to it after a long engagement - was heard to say, "Now that we are married, we are finally at the end of all our troubles."
A wiser, more experienced couple standing nearby responded, "That is true, but the question is, at which end?" Perspective does matter.
While you may have taken your final final exam, while you may never again pull an overnighter to complete a research paper, and while you may no longer need to worry about what grade you receive on an assignment, that does not mean that your education is complete. Calling this ceremony a commencement hopefully serves to remind you that while you are graduating from this university, you have not concluded the learning phase of your life; instead, you are at the other end of that process, the beginning - the commencement.
Brigham Young, the founder of this university, put it this way:
We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it: never, never.1
Thus one of the aims of a BYU education is to prepare our students for "lifelong learning."2 And, in that regard, it is important to note that we believe in very long lives. As Brother Brigham explained:
We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information.3
I have met numerous lifelong learners in my life - people who, no matter how much they know or how far along they are in their careers or lives, seem compelled to learn more. One such was Domingo Catricura. Domingo was a student in an Indian law class I team taught at the University of Chile Law School more than twenty years ago. Domingo was in his fifties at the time and was one of about twenty-five non-law students who attended the class along with thirty law students. The non-law students were invited to attend the course because they were leaders in various Mapuche communities - the Mapuches being the largest indigenous group in Chile. They we</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I was born in Mountain View, California, the second of (eventually) eleven children. We settled in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the east side of San Jose, not far from the rolling foothills that are crowned by the imposing Mount Hamilton, home to the Lick Observatory, "the first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory in the world."1 The weather was usually pleasant, even during the warm, sunny days of summer. As spring yielded to summer, the foothills would turn from a verdant green to a cozy, warm brown. But even on hot days, a cool breeze would flow off the bay every afternoon just as temperatures were peaking for the day.
Our subdivision consisted of a single principal street with four cul-de-sacs branching off toward the east. To the south was a walnut orchard that, in a childs mind, seemed dark and foreboding - the stuff of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. To the east was a large strawberry field. One day Mom sent my older brother, Jim, and me out to pick strawberries. I remember doing a lot of picking and eating; I dont remember bringing much home in the bowl she gave us.
Shortly thereafter, bulldozers and earthmovers took over as Interstate 680 came to our neighborhood. The walnut orchard also gave way to construction. "Silicon Valley" had to be built, and it seemed we were in the middle of it.
When I was fourteen years old, my father decided to purchase a microcomputer kit. This seemed like a sensible activity for a systems analyst in Silicon Valley. He chose the Heathkit H-89, and it was as amazing in 1979 as an iPad is today! I am sorry to get a little nerdy here, but I need to paint the picture properly. The H-89 was an all-in-one model with a keyboard and a twelve-inch display built right in. Its brain was an eight-bit Zilog brand Z80 CPU2 that ran at more than two megahertz (that is more than two million clock cycles per second). The kit came standard with 16K of RAM,3 but since Dad bought three expansion packs over time, we eventually had an entire 56K of RAM in which to lose ourselves. (In contrast, a typical smartphone today has billions of bytes of RAM and executes billions of clock cycles each second.)
Dad let us older boys help build the thing, but, as I recall, I was the most zealous deputy in the bunch. We had to bolt and solder all sorts of parts together, and soon enough there was this box - a true marvel of engineering and a testament to not only mankinds creativity but also our ability to follow complex instructions and manipulate tiny parts. There it was, sitting on our kitchen table with its fan purring, enthusiastically waiting for that next instruction to come in from its mass storage device, a cassette tape recorder. (Yes, it took another upgrade before we could use modern, high-capacity floppy disk technology.4)
The computer was built, so what next? I had to learn how to program it. I knew how it was as</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you - graduates, parents, and other supporters - thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbruck, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they dont. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests - like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>
