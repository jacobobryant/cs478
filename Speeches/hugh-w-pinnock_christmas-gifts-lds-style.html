  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="When Elder F. Enzio Busche was attempting to make a telephone call from Frankfurt, Germany, on December 5, 1995, he accidentally pushed the wrong button and was connected to Elder Dean L. Larsen at 7:00 a.m. Elder Larsen asked how things were going. Elder Busche replied by saying, "It is hard to imagine how much we are learning from our experiences in Russia." Recently he had visited in Moscow with the mission president there, who had several branches under his direction. He had written to each branch, wanting to know what they were going to do to celebrate Christmas. Each branch president replied except one. Several additional requests to the one were made without results. Finally the mission president contacted the branch president directly about the project and was startled to hear the response, "What is Christmas?"

Each of you knows what Christmas is, but today let us explore the holiday of holidays even more deeply.

I have never before been in a position to deliver an early Christmas gift to so many in one place. That is what I hope to do this morning. If there is a group of young adults anywhere in the world more deserving of a special Christmas gift, I cannot imagine where.

A number of years ago someone began delivering gifts to us by night, leaving them on our front porch about two weeks before Christmas. We didnt know who it was. When the first gift was discovered, I asked our children to look around the driveway and our front-porch area to see if the card had simply dropped out of the package. They couldnt find the name of the person who had brought the gift to us. The same thing happened the next day. Within another day or two we figured someone had made our family the focus of the 12 days of Christmas tradition. For almost two weeks prior to Christmas that year, a wonderful young woman dropped off gifts and, in an important way, changed the lives of our children. They were so touched by her generosity and her desire to &lt;i&gt;secretly&lt;/i&gt; do such a nice thing that they each have participated in the 12 days of Christmas for others since that time. The holiday season brings memories of her kindness.

I would like to address my remarks this day focusing on 12 presents that I would like to give you. I would prefer to deliver them in person, but that is impossible. If carefully thought about and used, they will keep you on the path of peace and joy today, tomorrow, and perhaps forever. Make this your happiest Christmas!
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Let the gospel of Jesus Christ be your guide, your personal philosophy, and the main determinate of your decision making.&lt;/em&gt;

Several years ago a man I had known for 30 years asked if he could come and spend time with me in my office.

I said, "Yes, of course," and eagerly anticipated his visit.

When we sat down he said something that surprised me. He mentioned that there were several of us who seemed to have things figured out when we were in school many years ago. I asked him who, and he named several of our mutual friends. In each instance they had been people who, at around your age, had determined to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The Savior made an interesting statement that only John recorded. We are all familiar with the words "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). But in that same chapter, a few verses later, the Lord said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words" (John 14:23). Then he went on to reiterate the most amazing promise for someone like you he had ever made. He said, "And my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" (John 14:23). Having the Savior move into your apartment or dorm would, I suppose, somewhat alter your daily behavior. Think for a moment: Could there ever be a greater reward than to be that close to the Father and Son?

Incidentally, my friend has gone on to live the gospel more deeply and thoroughly than ever before and is presently living a somewhat remarkable life because he decided to accept the gift of Jesus Christ in his life.

A lovely lady wrote:

&lt;i&gt;You never know when someone
Might catch a dream from you
Some little thing you say
Or some little thing you do.
Might open up the windows
Of a mind that seeks the light.
A certain way you live might not matter,
But, you never really know. It might!&lt;/i&gt;
[Jenny Jones Fredericks Belliston, "Christmas Message," 1997]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Select good friends.&lt;/em&gt;

Already many of you have as friends some of the finest individuals you will ever know. They love you, they appreciate you, they are happy in your presence and you in theirs. After your college years you will make more friends, of course, but as the years quickly come and go, you will learn that some of your closest friends are those men and women with whom you are already acquainted. Select your friends almost as carefully as you select your eternal companion. Choose friends of different backgrounds and cultures. Many of your special friends are to be different from you, and from that comes great strength. Continue to earn their friendship. My wife and I, as we mail Christmas cards each year, realize that some of these wonderful school friends remain the backbone of those we love today.

Friends are the bargains of life. Treat them as a precious treasure.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Guard your name and do your best.&lt;/em&gt;

I have a friend that I met in the seventh grade. His name is George Suvall. He has been a very successful basketball coach and trainer. He is also a homespun philosopher. Periodically I see him out walking near where we live. We stop to chat. George reported his family had come from Greece when he was very young. At first, because they didnt speak English in the home, George did not know how to read or write English very well. He was able to keep most of it a secret. An insightful teacher, because she cared and noticed that he was always trying to do his best, rescued him. One day his father was attempting to explain the importance of doing the best you can to George and said, "Hey, George, if you gonna be anything, you be the best anything you can be." His father knew that in America if you do the best you can, you will succeed.

Then his father said, "Georgie, there are two-a-things you cannot-a buy. Its a your-a-name and your-a-health. Take-a-care of them both." Those few words provided a personal philosophy George still follows.

First: Do the best you can.

Second: Protect your name.

Third: Guard your health.

If I notice a single characteristic about the men and women I serve with, it is their commitment to go the extra mile, often tirelessly working through the hours that sometimes an individual 40 years younger will not do. The &lt;i&gt;respect&lt;/i&gt; that you earn so often comes when you are &lt;i&gt;trusted&lt;/i&gt; to do extra things as needed. Your good name comes from what you do and the things you say.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fourth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Live a covenant-making life.&lt;/em&gt;

Are you willing to make a contract between yourself and God? Let us talk about dating, as an example. What is a date? Well, social interaction, going to the game, attending a college activity, studying together, watching a video or movie, going for a walk. It is a time to covenant with God that we will behave.

But what if we define a date as an opportunity for each of you to get to know someone better by promising yourself that at the end of the evening, the person you have been with is a better person than when you began the date? Can you say at the end of the evening, "Thank you for being such a kind person? It has been wonderful being with you tonight." Or maybe a date is a time to visit someone in need. Is it possible that your best dates are when you &lt;i&gt;lift&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;teach&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bless&lt;/i&gt; another? Could a date be a time to discuss the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of its magnificence? How about sharing a secret thought, an eternal dream, a future hope? Shouldnt a date be a frustration-free, guilt-free experience? Covenant with the Lord, promising him you will leave circumstances better than you find them.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fifth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Give the Savior a chance to build you to your full potential.&lt;/em&gt;

The Lord will push you right to the brink, if you allow him to. It was Jesus who stated, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Plead with the Lord to give you more challenges. If you study 20 hours each week, then say, "Lord, I am going for more." Let his example give you power to ask, "In addition to what I am doing, what else?"

&lt;i&gt;The heights by great men reached and kept
Were not attained by sudden flight,
But they, while their companions slept,
Were toiling upward in the night.&lt;/i&gt;
[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, &lt;i&gt;The Ladder of St. Augustine&lt;/i&gt; (1858), st. 10]

Elder Neal A. Maxwell received a very low grade on a high school English essay he wrote. He went to Miss Mason and said, "This is not fair. This is good work. I deserve a higher grade."

She said, "Sorry, but I grade students by potential. You are capable of much better work."

Elder Maxwell has often stated, "She made the difference in my life." Why? Because he wanted to meet her expectations. He wanted to be the best he could, and because of that he has continued to be one of the most verbal and clear-thinking people in the Church.

Are we meeting the Lords expectations for us? Never, ever forget: He has great plans for each of us!
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Speak and seek the truth.&lt;/em&gt;

In John 4:23 we read, "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in &lt;i&gt;truth:&lt;/i&gt; for the Father seeketh such to worship him" (emphasis added).

The Prophet Joseph Smith defined the gospel as all truth by stating, "Truth is Mormonism" (&lt;i&gt;Teachings,&lt;/i&gt; p. 139).

John also stated, "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32).

Seneca wrote, "Time discovers truth" (&lt;i&gt;Moral Essays,&lt;/i&gt; "On Anger," 2, 22).

"What is truth?" asked Pilate, but he would not even stay for an answer (John 18:38).

Whether you are a scientist or not, make pure truth an eternal objective. It is only when you are honest that you are safe.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seventh Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Seek to retain or reobtain the heart of a child, especially at Christmastime.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight,
Make me a child again just for tonight!&lt;/i&gt;
[Elizabeth Akers Allen,&lt;i&gt; Rock Me To Sleep&lt;/i&gt; (1860), st. 1]

In the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/i&gt; a British newspaper, dated December 21, 1995, an article was printed reporting that Laura Goffin, six years old, had been told that she was naughty during the stressful time many families go through while decorating for Christmas. In a few hasty words she was informed that Santa wouldnt be coming down the chimney because of something she had done to aggravate her parents.

Now six-year-old Laura had a nagging fear - would Santa overlook her little brother and sister, too?

&lt;i&gt;She decided to plead the cases of Abigail, four, and two-year-old Alfie in a personal letter to Father Christmas. She wrote: "Dear Santa, Dont come to me as I have been very naughty and I told my mummy I dont want any toys for Christmas and I dont want Christmas.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Please come to Abigail and Alfie, but not me. Laura."&lt;/i&gt;

She dropped her note into Santas letter box outside the town hall in Milford Haven, touching the heart of the mayors secretary when she read it as a yule season assignment.

The letters plea caused the secretary to search and finally find the little girl who was prepared to "miss out on the festive fun" of Christmas but didnt want her little brother and sister ignored - &lt;i&gt;a sweet little girl whom the world had not yet polluted.&lt;/i&gt;

The mayor gave her a new doll. Her parents were startled at the way she had responded, to which she said, "Im sorry I was naughty and I promise Father Christmas I will be a good girl from now on." ("The Girl Who Told Santa She Was Too Naughty to Be on His List," &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail,&lt;/i&gt; 21 December 1995, p. 28.)

Let me tell you of another example of Christmastime giving.

&lt;i&gt;During a drive to amass warm clothing to ship to suffering Saints, Elder Harold B. Lee and Elder Marion G. Romney took President George Albert Smith to Welfare Square in Salt Lake City. They were impressed by the generous response of the membership of the Church to the clothing drive and the preparations for sending the goods overseas. They watched President Smith observing the workers as they packaged this great volume of donated clothing and shoes. They saw tears running down his face. After a few moments, President Smith removed a new overcoat that he had on and said, "Please ship this also."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The Brethren said to him, "No, President, no; dont send that; its cold and you need your coat."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But President Smith would not take it back.&lt;/i&gt; [Thomas S. Monson, "My Brothers Keeper," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1994, p. 45; see also Glen L. Rudd, &lt;i&gt;Pure Religion&lt;/i&gt; (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1995), p. 248)]

May we be childlike, not childish. (See the ninth present to understand the difference.)
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eighth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Seek the world of "reality."&lt;/em&gt;

Are you seeking the world of reality? Periodically I will hear some less-than-thoughtful person criticize our lifestyle or demean that which we may be doing by saying, "Hey, get real. Join the real world." May I communicate with each of you that the real world is that which our prophet, Church leaders, and scriptures define. It is President Gordon B. Hinckley who is walking in the real world. How blessed we are to have him!

A number of years ago, as I was leaving the Church Office Building a day or two before Christmas, I found myself walking next to Elder Bruce R. McConkie. We wished each other a merry Christmas. I drove home and surmised he did the same. The day after Christmas the telephone rang. It was David Wirthlin, the administrator of the LDS Hospital.

"Guess what happened just before Christmas?" he asked.

"I dont know," I replied.

"Elder Bruce R. McConkie came to the hospital. He asked if he could give a few blessings. With permission granted, he went from room to room placing his hands on the heads of several dozen patients."

That is the real world, isnt it?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ninth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Be an effective giver.&lt;/em&gt;

There is a line that all must step over. It marks the place where an individual goes from receiving more pleasure from giving than from receiving gifts.

As seniors in high school, several of us had decided to sub for Santa. We had been given the name of a single mother who had three little children. They lived in a rather dismal apartment house with dirty walls, steps, and hallways. The whole building needed a coat of paint and a scrubbing. The doors didnt fit very well.

We gathered food, toys, and clothes. Excitedly we ascended a rickety staircase to the door with the number on it that we had been given.

A tired woman invited us in. There were no warm lights or even a tree to greet us. Her little children seemed too frightened to speak. As we placed the gifts around a tree we had bought and did some decorating, we observed a large, quite new television set. Our gifts were soon distributed, signaling that it was time for us to leave. The little family said very little as we slipped out of that dark place to go home. Father greeted me as I arrived home.

"How did it go?" he asked.

"Fine, Dad, except," I sputtered, "they had this large TV set." That was a time when many families could not afford a big television or even a small one.

My father said something like, "What does that have to do with it?"

I stammered, "Well, why didnt the lady buy Christmas toys, decorations, and food for her family instead of the big TV?"

"Maybe that is all they have for any happiness in their lives," Dad said.

I realized that what he said was true. We had observed how little else they had. Suddenly my whole immature attitude spun around. We had blessed four people and that was all that mattered. We are never quite the same after an experience like that. Some of my own pettiness evaporated that night as I realized how much we had enjoyed giving those gifts.

President Howard W. Hunter said:

&lt;i&gt;Let us look backward for just a moment to our childhood and analyze that which gave us the greatest happiness when we were children. I am inclined to believe that the things we enjoyed most and those that gave us the greatest happiness when we were children, were the things that were given to us. When our parents went away and returned, we always looked for some little token they would bring back to us. We looked forward to Christmas because of the things we were going to receive. Our whole life was built around receiving. At that time we did not understand the other side of giving. Sometime during our progress through this life, we came to that point when we suddenly realized it was not receiving that brings us happiness. To some this comes early in life; to others it comes later; and I am inclined to believe that there are some who never have this awakening during the daytime of their lives. They miss one of the great principles that brings happiness to us.&lt;/i&gt; [Howard W. Hunter, &lt;i&gt;Gifts That Money Cannot Buy,&lt;/i&gt; Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo, 26 April 1961), p. 2]

Yes, hopefully we will all be able to completely leave those years of childhood when our thoughts are more self-focused than they should be. Victor Herbert captured that truth when he wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Toyland, Toyland,
Little girl and boy land,
While you dwell within it
You are ever happy then.
Childhoods joyland,
Mystic, merry Toyland!
Once you pass its borders,
You can neer return again.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;
["Toyland," words by Glen MacDonough and music by Victor Herbert, Ardee Music Publishing, Inc., 1981]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tenth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bless others with your hands.&lt;/em&gt;

Look at your hands. Are they busy lifting the burdens of others? Are they used in happy greeting as you shake anothers hand? Marriage vows are taken while holding hands. Will the diploma you receive from this institution be received with a hand outstretched? Hands give blessings when placed on anothers head. It is with our hands that we write a term paper, paint a painting, play the piano, or wave to a friend in parting. What about the hands of your professors as they write upon a chalkboard or help you utilize a test tube, a computer, or a scientific measuring device more effectively?

Hands symbolize so much. Whom do your hands applaud? How do you use your hands? By wrapping a gift? By helping a friend with a complex mathematical problem? Each of you is learning to become more self-sustaining and more skilled in your lifes pursuits. Yet each of us needs a hand to lift us at one time or another in our lives. A couple falling in love as they hold each others hands are saying, "Its you I love." Those same hands could be saying, "I will protect you. I will strive to be a good servant of the Master. I will play with a child, help a colleague move - or help a merry Christmas to happen as we speak those holiday words."

President Gordon B. Hinckley reported a pioneer Christmas he had learned about. He quoted a story he had read in which the author wrote:

&lt;i&gt;I remember the Christmas of 1862. All of us children hung up our stockings. We jumped up early in the morning to see what Santa had brought, but there was not a thing in them. Mother wept bitterly. She went to her box and got a little apple and cut it in little tiny pieces and that was our Christmas, but I have never forgotten to this day how I loved her dear little hands as she was cutting that apple.&lt;/i&gt; [Hannah Daphne Smith Dalton, quoted by Gordon B. Hinckley, &lt;i&gt;CR,&lt;/i&gt; April 1959, p. 119]

Incidently, this year President Gordon B. Hinckley has been in 20 countries and has had 137 speaking assignments with 731,671 in attendance (information provided by the Office of the First Presidency, 6 December 1997). This does not include general conference nor so many other engagements he attends as he represents the Savior and each of us.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eleventh Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Offer the gift of generosity.&lt;/em&gt;

The level of our sharing with others is the level of our love for others combined with large doses of self-forgetting. Generosity, in part, symbolizes our maturity level.

On the birthdays of our children and grandchildren, my wife and I distribute a dollar for each year they have lived. I am 63 years old. An eight-year-old granddaughter had been worrying about the fact that I had just sent her $8 for her birthday but that she couldnt afford to send me 63 one-dollar bills for my birthday.

Finally she hit upon a solution to her frustration. She said to our daughter, Annette, "Mom, I know how I can do for Grandfather what he does for us. I will send him one dollar for every 10 years he has lived. Thats six dollars and another three for the three of 63." She sent me back her eight birthday dollars plus one extra, never caring she had lost a dollar in the transaction.

Beginning a number of years ago, a young woman, Kathy Conwell, collected angels to put on a special Christmas tree she had at home. Kathy was a lovely young woman, a college student who learned that she had a very violent aggressive form of cancer. She had been told that she would not live long but that medical science would do everything it could to assist her, and she also received several blessings. Her collection eventually grew to 156 angels, covering a six-foot tree with lights and these special decorations. Kathy and her mother, Joy Conwell, would go to yard sales, post-Christmas sales, and anywhere little angels could be located. At her untimely death in October 1996, she asked her mother to distribute these angels to her friends. I was blessed to receive one of them. I have kept it in my office now for more than 400 days. She is now an angel herself. Her generosity goes on blessing us all.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twelfth Present&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Understand the supreme Christmas.&lt;/em&gt;

The scriptures remind us

&lt;i&gt;that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.&lt;/i&gt;[Luke 2:1-7]

The greatest person ever to live on this planet was born.

&lt;i&gt;What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;If I were a wise man
I would do my part, - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Yet what I can I give Him,
Give my heart.&lt;/i&gt;
[Christina Georgina Rossetti, "A Christmas Carol," also called "Mid-Winter"]

Which brings us to you and the gifts you can give Jesus. Christina Rossetti essentially penned, "I give him my heart." What does that mean, "Give him my heart?"

James, the Lords half-brother (see Galatians 1:19), thoughtfully wrote, "Every good gift and every perfect gift [the Atonement] is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (James 1:17). This being true then, we must help others to grasp the true meaning of the Atonement and Christmas, which is &lt;i&gt;Christ.&lt;/i&gt;

Think of the influence you students can have on parents, siblings, friends, and relatives by helping them to think about Jesus even more this year than perhaps they have on earlier occasions. You will never forget this Christmas if you do.

A while ago I read of a survey of more than 6,000 teenagers (not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) pertaining to their feelings about the scriptures. Only 14 percent said they considered reading the scriptures "very important." Perhaps that would be true of some of us.

When the students were asked about the importance they place on a variety of activities, from their relationships with God to helping others, reading the Bible ranked lowest.

Surely Christmastime is the best time of all to read the scriptures! Think how the circumstances surrounding the birth of the baby Jesus come alive when we read Luke, who had learned so much from Mary because he wrote the things that only she could have told him. Then include with those beautiful verses those found in 3 Nephi 12 and nearby sections of the Book of Mormon. It will add tinsel to your Christmas this year, and that is a promise!

It follows then that you introduce a sacred spirit to all that goes on.

Merchants of things have invaded the minds of most people, disregarding the "holy day" characteristics of the Christmas holiday. Commercialism has turned it into a day of &lt;i&gt;feasting, foolishness,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;football&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;friends, family, faith,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;following Jesus.&lt;/i&gt;

There are exceptions, thank goodness, that each of you know about. But now, let us take you and transplant you wherever you will be on Christmas Day. Your responding with gracious enthusiasm, kindly expressing your love of the Savior and of those of your family and others with whom you come in contact will make this Christmas the best ever. Isnt that the spirit of Christmas?

Perhaps Johnny Hart, the great Christian cartoonist, said it as well as anyone. He wrote a Christmas poem that appeared in his comic strip &lt;i&gt;B.C.&lt;/i&gt; four years ago. It read:

&lt;i&gt;Follow the star
and you shall see,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;His gift of grace
to you and me.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Follow the star&amp;lt;
that followed the youth,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who gave us love
and taught us truth.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Follow the star
that follows the man&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Who takes us
where none other can,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;To where our hopes
and treasures are.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Follow, O follow the star.&lt;/i&gt;
[Johnny Hart, &lt;i&gt;B.C.,&lt;/i&gt; 26 December 1993]

Yes, the supreme Christmas gift is Jesus. A loving Father let him hang on the cross, even after he had cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46).

Why did Jesus need to suffer so? Because the Father loves us so much that we have this greatest of gifts, becoming purified through his atonement. Thanks to a loving Heavenly Father who provided his Firstborn Son to give us examples of how to live and in what to believe. Resolve to give yourself to him as your supreme gift. And if you do, next year and all the years to follow will be lived in concert with what our Father and Jesus hope you will become. To these simple truths I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.

			<p>When Elder F. Enzio Busche was attempting to make a telephone call from Frankfurt, Germany, on December 5, 1995, he accidentally pushed the wrong button and was connected to Elder Dean L. Larsen at 7:00 a.m. Elder Larsen asked how things were going. Elder Busche replied by saying, "It is hard to imagine how much we are learning from our experiences in Russia." Recently he had visited in Moscow with the mission president there, who had several branches under his direction. He had written to each branch, wanting to know what they were going to do to celebrate Christmas. Each branch president replied except one. Several additional requests to the one were made without results. Finally the mission president contacted the branch president directly about the project and was startled to hear the response, "What is Christmas?"</p>
<p>Each of you knows what Christmas is, but today let us explore the holiday of holidays even more deeply.</p>
<p>I have never before been in a position to deliver an early Christmas gift to so many in one place. That is what I hope to do this morning. If there is a group of young adults anywhere in the world more deserving of a special Christmas gift, I cannot imagine where.</p>
<p>A number of years ago someone began delivering gifts to us by night, leaving them on our front porch about two weeks before Christmas. We didnt know who it was. When the first gift was discovered, I asked our children to look around the driveway and our front-porch area to see if the card had simply dropped out of the package. They couldnt find the name of the person who had brought the gift to us. The same thing happened the next day. Within another day or two we figured someone had made our family the focus of the 12 days of Christmas tradition. For almost two weeks prior to Christmas that year, a wonderful young woman dropped off gifts and, in an important way, changed the lives of our children. They were so touched by her generosity and her desire to <i>secretly</i> do such a nice thing that they each have participated in the 12 days of Christmas for others since that time. The holiday season brings memories of her kindness.</p>
<p>I would like to address my remarks this day focusing on 12 presents that I would like to give you. I would prefer to deliver them in person, but that is impossible. If carefully thought about and used, they will keep you on the path of peace and joy today, tomorrow, and perhaps forever. Make this your happiest Christmas!</p>
<h2><b>First Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Let the gospel of Jesus Christ be your guide, your personal philosophy, and the main determinate of your decision making.</em></p>
<p>Several years ago a man I had known for 30 years asked if he could come and spend time with me in my office.</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, of course," and eagerly anticipated his visit.</p>
<p>When we sat down he said something that surprised me. He mentioned that there were several of us who seemed to have things figured out when we were in school many years ago. I asked him who, and he named several of our mutual friends. In each instance they had been people who, at around your age, had determined to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Savior made an interesting statement that only John recorded. We are all familiar with the words "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). But in that same chapter, a few verses later, the Lord said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words" (John 14:23). Then he went on to reiterate the most amazing promise for someone like you he had ever made. He said, "And my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" (John 14:23). Having the Savior move into your apartment or dorm would, I suppose, somewhat alter your daily behavior. Think for a moment: Could there ever be a greater reward than to be that close to the Father and Son?</p>
<p>Incidentally, my friend has gone on to live the gospel more deeply and thoroughly than ever before and is presently living a somewhat remarkable life because he decided to accept the gift of Jesus Christ in his life.</p>
<p>A lovely lady wrote:</p>
<p><i>You never know when someone<br />
Might catch a dream from you<br />
Some little thing you say<br />
Or some little thing you do.<br />
Might open up the windows<br />
Of a mind that seeks the light.<br />
A certain way you live might not matter,<br />
But, you never really know. It might!</i><br />
[Jenny Jones Fredericks Belliston, "Christmas Message," 1997]</p>
<h2><b>Second Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Select good friends.</em></p>
<p>Already many of you have as friends some of the finest individuals you will ever know. They love you, they appreciate you, they are happy in your presence and you in theirs. After your college years you will make more friends, of course, but as the years quickly come and go, you will learn that some of your closest friends are those men and women with whom you are already acquainted. Select your friends almost as carefully as you select your eternal companion. Choose friends of different backgrounds and cultures. Many of your special friends are to be different from you, and from that comes great strength. Continue to earn their friendship. My wife and I, as we mail Christmas cards each year, realize that some of these wonderful school friends remain the backbone of those we love today.</p>
<p>Friends are the bargains of life. Treat them as a precious treasure.</p>
<h2><b>Third Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Guard your name and do your best.</em></p>
<p>I have a friend that I met in the seventh grade. His name is George Suvall. He has been a very successful basketball coach and trainer. He is also a homespun philosopher. Periodically I see him out walking near where we live. We stop to chat. George reported his family had come from Greece when he was very young. At first, because they didnt speak English in the home, George did not know how to read or write English very well. He was able to keep most of it a secret. An insightful teacher, because she cared and noticed that he was always trying to do his best, rescued him. One day his father was attempting to explain the importance of doing the best you can to George and said, "Hey, George, if you gonna be anything, you be the best anything you can be." His father knew that in America if you do the best you can, you will succeed.</p>
<p>Then his father said, "Georgie, there are two-a-things you cannot-a buy. Its a your-a-name and your-a-health. Take-a-care of them both." Those few words provided a personal philosophy George still follows.</p>
<p>First: Do the best you can.</p>
<p>Second: Protect your name.</p>
<p>Third: Guard your health.</p>
<p>If I notice a single characteristic about the men and women I serve with, it is their commitment to go the extra mile, often tirelessly working through the hours that sometimes an individual 40 years younger will not do. The <i>respect</i> that you earn so often comes when you are <i>trusted</i> to do extra things as needed. Your good name comes from what you do and the things you say.</p>
<h2><b>Fourth Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Live a covenant-making life.</em></p>
<p>Are you willing to make a contract between yourself and God? Let us talk about dating, as an example. What is a date? Well, social interaction, going to the game, attending a college activity, studying together, watching a video or movie, going for a walk. It is a time to covenant with God that we will behave.</p>
<p>But what if we define a date as an opportunity for each of you to get to know someone better by promising yourself that at the end of the evening, the person you have been with is a better person than when you began the date? Can you say at the end of the evening, "Thank you for being such a kind person? It has been wonderful being with you tonight." Or maybe a date is a time to visit someone in need. Is it possible that your best dates are when you <i>lift</i> and <i>teach</i> and<i>help</i> and <i>bless</i> another? Could a date be a time to discuss the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of its magnificence? How about sharing a secret thought, an eternal dream, a future hope? Shouldnt a date be a frustration-free, guilt-free experience? Covenant with the Lord, promising him you will leave circumstances better than you find them.</p>
<h2><b>Fifth Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Give the Savior a chance to build you to your full potential.</em></p>
<p>The Lord will push you right to the brink, if you allow him to. It was Jesus who stated, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Plead with the Lord to give you more challenges. If you study 20 hours each week, then say, "Lord, I am going for more." Let his example give you power to ask, "In addition to what I am doing, what else?"</p>
<p><i>The heights by great men reached and kept<br />
Were not attained by sudden flight,<br />
But they, while their companions slept,<br />
Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br />
[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, <i>The Ladder of St. Augustine</i> (1858), st. 10]</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell received a very low grade on a high school English essay he wrote. He went to Miss Mason and said, "This is not fair. This is good work. I deserve a higher grade."</p>
<p>She said, "Sorry, but I grade students by potential. You are capable of much better work."</p>
<p>Elder Maxwell has often stated, "She made the difference in my life." Why? Because he wanted to meet her expectations. He wanted to be the best he could, and because of that he has continued to be one of the most verbal and clear-thinking people in the Church.</p>
<p>Are we meeting the Lords expectations for us? Never, ever forget: He has great plans for each of us!</p>
<h3><b>Sixth Present</b></h3>
<p><em>Speak and seek the truth.</em></p>
<p>In John 4:23 we read, "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in <i>truth:</i> for the Father seeketh such to worship him" (emphasis added).</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith defined the gospel as all truth by stating, "Truth is Mormonism" (<i>Teachings,</i> p. 139).</p>
<p>John also stated, "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32).</p>
<p>Seneca wrote, "Time discovers truth" (<i>Moral Essays,</i> "On Anger," 2, 22).</p>
<p>"What is truth?" asked Pilate, but he would not even stay for an answer (John 18:38).</p>
<p>Whether you are a scientist or not, make pure truth an eternal objective. It is only when you are honest that you are safe.</p>
<h2><b>Seventh Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Seek to retain or reobtain the heart of a child, especially at Christmastime.</em></p>
<p><i>Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight,<br />
Make me a child again just for tonight!</i><br />
[Elizabeth Akers Allen,<i> Rock Me To Sleep</i> (1860), st. 1]</p>
<p>In the <i>Daily Mail,</i> a British newspaper, dated December 21, 1995, an article was printed reporting that Laura Goffin, six years old, had been told that she was naughty during the stressful time many families go through while decorating for Christmas. In a few hasty words she was informed that Santa wouldnt be coming down the chimney because of something she had done to aggravate her parents.</p>
<p>Now six-year-old Laura had a nagging fear - would Santa overlook her little brother and sister, too?</p>
<p><i>She decided to plead the cases of Abigail, four, and two-year-old Alfie in a personal letter to Father Christmas. She wrote: "Dear Santa, Dont come to me as I have been very naughty and I told my mummy I dont want any toys for Christmas and I dont want Christmas.</i></p>
<p><i>"Please come to Abigail and Alfie, but not me. Laura."</i></p>
<p>She dropped her note into Santas letter box outside the town hall in Milford Haven, touching the heart of the mayors secretary when she read it as a yule season assignment.</p>
<p>The letters plea caused the secretary to search and finally find the little girl who was prepared to "miss out on the festive fun" of Christmas but didnt want her little brother and sister ignored - <i>a sweet little girl whom the world had not yet polluted.</i></p>
<p>The mayor gave her a new doll. Her parents were startled at the way she had responded, to which she said, "Im sorry I was naughty and I promise Father Christmas I will be a good girl from now on." ("The Girl Who Told Santa She Was Too Naughty to Be on His List," <i>Daily Mail,</i> 21 December 1995, p. 28.)</p>
<p>Let me tell you of another example of Christmastime giving.</p>
<p><i>During a drive to amass warm clothing to ship to suffering Saints, Elder Harold B. Lee and Elder Marion G. Romney took President George Albert Smith to Welfare Square in Salt Lake City. They were impressed by the generous response of the membership of the Church to the clothing drive and the preparations for sending the goods overseas. They watched President Smith observing the workers as they packaged this great volume of donated clothing and shoes. They saw tears running down his face. After a few moments, President Smith removed a new overcoat that he had on and said, "Please ship this also."</i></p>
<p><i>The Brethren said to him, "No, President, no; dont send that; its cold and you need your coat."</i></p>
<p><i>But President Smith would not take it back.</i> [Thomas S. Monson, "My Brothers Keeper," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1994, p. 45; see also Glen L. Rudd, <i>Pure Religion</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1995), p. 248)]</p>
<p>May we be childlike, not childish. (See the ninth present to understand the difference.)</p>
<h2><b>Eighth Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Seek the world of "reality."</em></p>
<p>Are you seeking the world of reality? Periodically I will hear some less-than-thoughtful person criticize our lifestyle or demean that which we may be doing by saying, "Hey, get real. Join the real world." May I communicate with each of you that the real world is that which our prophet, Church leaders, and scriptures define. It is President Gordon B. Hinckley who is walking in the real world. How blessed we are to have him!</p>
<p>A number of years ago, as I was leaving the Church Office Building a day or two before Christmas, I found myself walking next to Elder Bruce R. McConkie. We wished each other a merry Christmas. I drove home and surmised he did the same. The day after Christmas the telephone rang. It was David Wirthlin, the administrator of the LDS Hospital.</p>
<p>"Guess what happened just before Christmas?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I dont know," I replied.</p>
<p>"Elder Bruce R. McConkie came to the hospital. He asked if he could give a few blessings. With permission granted, he went from room to room placing his hands on the heads of several dozen patients."</p>
<p>That is the real world, isnt it?</p>
<h2><b>Ninth Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Be an effective giver.</em></p>
<p>There is a line that all must step over. It marks the place where an individual goes from receiving more pleasure from giving than from receiving gifts.</p>
<p>As seniors in high school, several of us had decided to sub for Santa. We had been given the name of a single mother who had three little children. They lived in a rather dismal apartment house with dirty walls, steps, and hallways. The whole building needed a coat of paint and a scrubbing. The doors didnt fit very well.</p>
<p>We gathered food, toys, and clothes. Excitedly we ascended a rickety staircase to the door with the number on it that we had been given.</p>
<p>A tired woman invited us in. There were no warm lights or even a tree to greet us. Her little children seemed too frightened to speak. As we placed the gifts around a tree we had bought and did some decorating, we observed a large, quite new television set. Our gifts were soon distributed, signaling that it was time for us to leave. The little family said very little as we slipped out of that dark place to go home. Father greeted me as I arrived home.</p>
<p>"How did it go?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Fine, Dad, except," I sputtered, "they had this large TV set." That was a time when many families could not afford a big television or even a small one.</p>
<p>My father said something like, "What does that have to do with it?"</p>
<p>I stammered, "Well, why didnt the lady buy Christmas toys, decorations, and food for her family instead of the big TV?"</p>
<p>"Maybe that is all they have for any happiness in their lives," Dad said.</p>
<p>I realized that what he said was true. We had observed how little else they had. Suddenly my whole immature attitude spun around. We had blessed four people and that was all that mattered. We are never quite the same after an experience like that. Some of my own pettiness evaporated that night as I realized how much we had enjoyed giving those gifts.</p>
<p>President Howard W. Hunter said:</p>
<p><i>Let us look backward for just a moment to our childhood and analyze that which gave us the greatest happiness when we were children. I am inclined to believe that the things we enjoyed most and those that gave us the greatest happiness when we were children, were the things that were given to us. When our parents went away and returned, we always looked for some little token they would bring back to us. We looked forward to Christmas because of the things we were going to receive. Our whole life was built around receiving. At that time we did not understand the other side of giving. Sometime during our progress through this life, we came to that point when we suddenly realized it was not receiving that brings us happiness. To some this comes early in life; to others it comes later; and I am inclined to believe that there are some who never have this awakening during the daytime of their lives. They miss one of the great principles that brings happiness to us.</i> [Howard W. Hunter, <i>Gifts That Money Cannot Buy,</i> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo, 26 April 1961), p. 2]</p>
<p>Yes, hopefully we will all be able to completely leave those years of childhood when our thoughts are more self-focused than they should be. Victor Herbert captured that truth when he wrote:</p>
<p><i>Toyland, Toyland,<br />
Little girl and boy land,<br />
While you dwell within it<br />
You are ever happy then.<br />
Childhoods joyland,<br />
Mystic, merry Toyland!<br />
Once you pass its borders,<br />
You can neer return again.</i>&lt;<br />
["Toyland," words by Glen MacDonough and music by Victor Herbert, Ardee Music Publishing, Inc., 1981]</p>
<h2><b>Tenth Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Bless others with your hands.</em></p>
<p>Look at your hands. Are they busy lifting the burdens of others? Are they used in happy greeting as you shake anothers hand? Marriage vows are taken while holding hands. Will the diploma you receive from this institution be received with a hand outstretched? Hands give blessings when placed on anothers head. It is with our hands that we write a term paper, paint a painting, play the piano, or wave to a friend in parting. What about the hands of your professors as they write upon a chalkboard or help you utilize a test tube, a computer, or a scientific measuring device more effectively?</p>
<p>Hands symbolize so much. Whom do your hands applaud? How do you use your hands? By wrapping a gift? By helping a friend with a complex mathematical problem? Each of you is learning to become more self-sustaining and more skilled in your lifes pursuits. Yet each of us needs a hand to lift us at one time or another in our lives. A couple falling in love as they hold each others hands are saying, "Its you I love." Those same hands could be saying, "I will protect you. I will strive to be a good servant of the Master. I will play with a child, help a colleague move - or help a merry Christmas to happen as we speak those holiday words."</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley reported a pioneer Christmas he had learned about. He quoted a story he had read in which the author wrote:</p>
<p><i>I remember the Christmas of 1862. All of us children hung up our stockings. We jumped up early in the morning to see what Santa had brought, but there was not a thing in them. Mother wept bitterly. She went to her box and got a little apple and cut it in little tiny pieces and that was our Christmas, but I have never forgotten to this day how I loved her dear little hands as she was cutting that apple.</i> [Hannah Daphne Smith Dalton, quoted by Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>CR,</i> April 1959, p. 119]</p>
<p>Incidently, this year President Gordon B. Hinckley has been in 20 countries and has had 137 speaking assignments with 731,671 in attendance (information provided by the Office of the First Presidency, 6 December 1997). This does not include general conference nor so many other engagements he attends as he represents the Savior and each of us.</p>
<h2><b>Eleventh Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Offer the gift of generosity.</em></p>
<p>The level of our sharing with others is the level of our love for others combined with large doses of self-forgetting. Generosity, in part, symbolizes our maturity level.</p>
<p>On the birthdays of our children and grandchildren, my wife and I distribute a dollar for each year they have lived. I am 63 years old. An eight-year-old granddaughter had been worrying about the fact that I had just sent her $8 for her birthday but that she couldnt afford to send me 63 one-dollar bills for my birthday.</p>
<p>Finally she hit upon a solution to her frustration. She said to our daughter, Annette, "Mom, I know how I can do for Grandfather what he does for us. I will send him one dollar for every 10 years he has lived. Thats six dollars and another three for the three of 63." She sent me back her eight birthday dollars plus one extra, never caring she had lost a dollar in the transaction.</p>
<p>Beginning a number of years ago, a young woman, Kathy Conwell, collected angels to put on a special Christmas tree she had at home. Kathy was a lovely young woman, a college student who learned that she had a very violent aggressive form of cancer. She had been told that she would not live long but that medical science would do everything it could to assist her, and she also received several blessings. Her collection eventually grew to 156 angels, covering a six-foot tree with lights and these special decorations. Kathy and her mother, Joy Conwell, would go to yard sales, post-Christmas sales, and anywhere little angels could be located. At her untimely death in October 1996, she asked her mother to distribute these angels to her friends. I was blessed to receive one of them. I have kept it in my office now for more than 400 days. She is now an angel herself. Her generosity goes on blessing us all.</p>
<h2><b>Twelfth Present</b></h2>
<p><em>Understand the supreme Christmas.</em></p>
<p>The scriptures remind us</p>
<p><i>that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</i></p>
<p><i>(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</i></p>
<p><i>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</i></p>
<p><i>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; . . .</i></p>
<p><i>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</i></p>
<p><i>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</i></p>
<p><i>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</i>[Luke 2:1-7]</p>
<p>The greatest person ever to live on this planet was born.</p>
<p><i>What can I give Him,<br />
Poor as I am?</i></p>
<p><i>If I were a shepherd<br />
I would bring a lamb,</i></p>
<p><i>If I were a wise man<br />
I would do my part, - </i></p>
<p><i>Yet what I can I give Him,<br />
Give my heart.</i><br />
[Christina Georgina Rossetti, "A Christmas Carol," also called "Mid-Winter"]</p>
<p>Which brings us to you and the gifts you can give Jesus. Christina Rossetti essentially penned, "I give him my heart." What does that mean, "Give him my heart?"</p>
<p>James, the Lords half-brother (see Galatians 1:19), thoughtfully wrote, "Every good gift and every perfect gift [the Atonement] is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (James 1:17). This being true then, we must help others to grasp the true meaning of the Atonement and Christmas, which is <i>Christ.</i></p>
<p>Think of the influence you students can have on parents, siblings, friends, and relatives by helping them to think about Jesus even more this year than perhaps they have on earlier occasions. You will never forget this Christmas if you do.</p>
<p>A while ago I read of a survey of more than 6,000 teenagers (not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) pertaining to their feelings about the scriptures. Only 14 percent said they considered reading the scriptures "very important." Perhaps that would be true of some of us.</p>
<p>When the students were asked about the importance they place on a variety of activities, from their relationships with God to helping others, reading the Bible ranked lowest.</p>
<p>Surely Christmastime is the best time of all to read the scriptures! Think how the circumstances surrounding the birth of the baby Jesus come alive when we read Luke, who had learned so much from Mary because he wrote the things that only she could have told him. Then include with those beautiful verses those found in 3 Nephi 12 and nearby sections of the Book of Mormon. It will add tinsel to your Christmas this year, and that is a promise!</p>
<p>It follows then that you introduce a sacred spirit to all that goes on.</p>
<p>Merchants of things have invaded the minds of most people, disregarding the "holy day" characteristics of the Christmas holiday. Commercialism has turned it into a day of <i>feasting, foolishness,</i> and <i>football</i> instead of <i>friends, family, faith,</i> and <i>following Jesus.</i></p>
<p>There are exceptions, thank goodness, that each of you know about. But now, let us take you and transplant you wherever you will be on Christmas Day. Your responding with gracious enthusiasm, kindly expressing your love of the Savior and of those of your family and others with whom you come in contact will make this Christmas the best ever. Isnt that the spirit of Christmas?</p>
<p>Perhaps Johnny Hart, the great Christian cartoonist, said it as well as anyone. He wrote a Christmas poem that appeared in his comic strip <i>B.C.</i> four years ago. It read:</p>
<p><i>Follow the star<br />
and you shall see,</i></p>
<p><i>His gift of grace<br />
to you and me.</i></p>
<p><i>Follow the star&lt;<br />
that followed the youth,</i></p>
<p><i>Who gave us love<br />
and taught us truth.</i></p>
<p><i>Follow the star<br />
that follows the man</i></p>
<p><i>Who takes us<br />
where none other can,</i></p>
<p><i>To where our hopes<br />
and treasures are.</i></p>
<p><i>Follow, O follow the star.</i><br />
[Johnny Hart, <i>B.C.,</i> 26 December 1993]</p>
<p>Yes, the supreme Christmas gift is Jesus. A loving Father let him hang on the cross, even after he had cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46).</p>
<p>Why did Jesus need to suffer so? Because the Father loves us so much that we have this greatest of gifts, becoming purified through his atonement. Thanks to a loving Heavenly Father who provided his Firstborn Son to give us examples of how to live and in what to believe. Resolve to give yourself to him as your supreme gift. And if you do, next year and all the years to follow will be lived in concert with what our Father and Jesus hope you will become. To these simple truths I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I am grateful to be with you on this cold December morning. I pray that the warmth of the Spirit will bless us that we might be edified during our few moments together.
Today I want to talk with you about the greatest story ever told - and one of its less obvious but most important themes. You could probably recite much of this story by heart. It occupies little more than a page of scripture. It begins with the familiar duty of paying taxes. It continues with a journey that was not unusual for the time. The plot thickens when no room can be found "in the inns";1 it culminates when the Son of God is born of Mary, "a precious and chosen" virgin.2
We know little about the real people and few details regarding the true events. And yet, no matter how many times we read the story of the first Christmas, there always seems to be something new we can learn from it. That is because, as prophets have taught, "the word of God is quick," or living.3 It takes on fresh and deeper meaning whenever we are spiritually ready to receive it.
Something that stands out to me in the account of the Saviors birth is that on four separate occasions an angel appeared with the message "Fear not."
When the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias with news that his wife would bear a son, the forerunner of the Messiah, he said, "Fear not, . . . for thy prayer is heard."4
Later the same angel visited "beautiful and fair"5 Mary to tell her that she would be the mother of the Son of God, assuring her with similar words: "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."6
Shortly thereafter an angel appeared to Joseph the carpenter in a dream and said, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife."7
And then, on that holy night, as all eternity watched in reverent silence, the angel came upon humble shepherds keeping watch over their flock. The shepherds, who "were sore afraid,"8 heard the angel proclaim, "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."9
So much of what happened during those pivotal moments in the nativity narrative depended upon the courage of people like Zacharias, Mary, Joseph, and the shepherds. God had a monumental task for each of them; their lives were about to change forever. Imagine if they had let fear overcome them. What if they had pulled back, doubted, and failed to do what God needed them to do?
This less obvious theme from the account of the first Christmas intrigues me because I, like you, have fears, and I need to be reminded at times to fear not. I dont know what your fears are. Like Zacharias, who feared that he would never have children, you may have fears about your family. Or maybe your fear isnt that you wont have children but that you will have children, whom you will have to r</span>

So, in conclusion, I love Christmas and I love BYU devotionals. I am grateful to be with you, and my older siblings, graduates of BYU, are here, having traveled from Arizona and Idaho. They must have thought I was graduating today. Im not saying my older siblings are old, but there were no history classes on campus when they attended, just current events. The deodorant Old Spice was then known as New Spice, and the Dead Sea was just mildly sick.
Since my academic focus is education law, and since much of that discipline and practice is focused on protecting the rights and persons of children, Id like to discuss what it means in the perfect economy of the Lords kingdom to become as a little child. I believe Christmas and the birth of the Christ child help us explore this concept.
Becoming as a Little Child
When our Heavenly Father wanted to save the world, He didnt take over a country or develop a militia. He sent a helpless child to a choice and worthy woman and a humble and believing man living in insecure circumstances in a conquered land occupied by a hostile force. The harsh geopolitical and military circumstances of Christs birth should remind us that Heavenly Father can bless us even if the external circumstances of our lives arent necessarily easy or peaceful.
Herod the Great ruled over that land, under Romes ultimate control. He was mighty and built magnificent monuments - at least one of which overshadowed the land when Christ was born, being visible in all directions for miles. We cant help but contrast Herods mighty palace with the stable. If we knew for sure where the stable was, wouldnt we wish to visit the site of that sacred birth? But who cares as much about anything Herod built, besides perhaps one or two of our learned faculty members? Most of us with a normal threshold for boredom ignore Herod.
Christ is infinitely more important. We seek Christs words and probably have many of His words memorized. Well, not everyone does apparently, because Im always surprised on Jeopardy when those brainiacs often seem to know nothing about the scriptures. We Mormons, in turn, are continually lost on the "Potent Potables" category. We celebrate and rejoice in the words and the happenings of Christs birth. Does anyone, even the most bookishly versant among us, celebrate the words or circumstances of Herod and his birth?
The New Testament shows us something of the Christ child we celebrate at Christmas in the perfect young adult He has become. He hasnt become full of Himself and self-important, careworn, and brusque. Although Isaiah described Him as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted wi</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Beloved students, faculty, and friends of Brigham Young University, you are a marvelous sight, and Susan and I are honored and full of gratitude to be with you today. We always feel tender feelings when we return to Brigham Young University, as this is where we met and were engaged. We met in a religion class called Your Religious Problems. I have forgotten many of the details of the class, but I do know that whatever my religious problem was, she solved it, and whatever her problem was, well, I hope I solved it too.
In a very short while your final exams will end and you will return to family or friends for Christmas. In view of the approaching Yuletide season, I have chosen to share with you today a Christmas message, a message of hope and glad tidings, even my assurance and witness of the birth, life, and eternal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
More than 700 years before his birth, Isaiah prophesied of Christ in words memorialized by George Frideric Handel in the Messiah oratorio:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. [Isaiah 9:6]
In this one concise sentence, Isaiah foretold Christs birth; His Second Coming; His millennial reign; and His eternal mission as the mighty God and Father of our salvation.
Handels Messiah also brought to glorious musical life the following admonition, based on Isaiah:
O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, . . . O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! [Handel, "O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion," Messiah; see Isaiah 40:9]
Brothers and sisters, join with me and behold your God! Behold your God, born as a little child in Bethlehem and wrapped in swaddling clothes. Behold your God, born in poverty and simplicity that He might walk among common people as a common man. Behold your God, even the infinite and eternal Redeemer, the Messiah, veiled in flesh and come to live upon the very earth that He created.
Return with me to that sacred first Christmas in Bethlehem to contemplate the birth of our Lord. He came in the quiet of the night, in the meridian of time, He who was Immanuel, the Rod of Jesse, the Dayspring, the Key of David, the very Lord of Might. His birth marked the promised visitation of the Creator to earth, the condescension of God to man. As Isaiah wrote of the event:
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. [Isaiah 9:2]
We know from modern revelation that Jesus was born on April 6, making it springtime in Judea when the anointed King of Israel came to earth. As Micah had prophes</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">With Christmas only a fortnight away, thoughts turn to our homes and families. Sister Nelson and I enjoy many Christmas traditions. On our mantle over the fireplace we display a small framed photograph of each member of the family. With 10 children, their spouses, and 54 grandchildren, thats quite a flock of photos. We have been doing this for so long that most of the pictures are no longer current. The children scramble to find their own pictures among the many.
They also admire Sister Nelsons large assortment of dolls collected from various countries throughout the world. Those dolls are nestled among the branches of our Christmas tree. Her cookies, cakes, and candies are always in great demand. And we love to read scriptures of the Christmas story with our family.
Through all of our various Christmas traditions, I hope that we are focused first upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men still adore Him. At this special devotional, many of you have come with a prayer in your hearts that you may learn from one of the Twelve Apostles more about our Lord and Master.
We commemorate His humble birth at this time of year, even though we know it did not occur in December but more likely in April. Scriptures declare that His mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph. They had participated in the first of two components of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Their espousal might be likened to an engagement in our culture, which is followed later by the second component of a marriage ceremony.
Lukes account records the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mary when she first learned of her favored future. I read from chapter 1:
"Hail, thou that art highly favoured . . . : blessed art thou among women. . . .
"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest."1 (Note the capital S; capital H.)
God is the Highest. Jesus was to be the Son of the Highest.
"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"2
She knew of her virginal status.
"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."3
Before Joseph and Mary came together, she was expecting that holy child. Joseph desired to protect her privacy,4 hoping to spare Mary the punishment given to a woman pregnant without a completed marriage. While he pondered these things, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph, saying,
"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
"And she shall bri</span>
