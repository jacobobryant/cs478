  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="To those who graduated before you, you owe a debt of gratitude. Because they have used their talents and educations to add to the reputation of the university, you and I can take pride in associating the name Brigham Young University with our own names and reputations. We can write BYU with confidence on applications to graduate schools, on résumés, on job applications, or on paperwork for professional societies.

The university has long been recognized for producing women and men of integrity. BYU graduates are known as outstanding employees, notable scholars, and respected leaders. You are among those who have been grounded and rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ.

President Hinckley in media interviews used to note that we are, as a people, not perfect. He would say, “We make mistakes, and we have failures.” Then we would add, “Yes, we do.”

Our claim is not that we have arrived in any state of perfection but that it is before us as a goal. I believe the majority of BYU graduates the world over are worthy citizens and advocates of what is true and right. They are Church members and others who live their religion the best they can and stand by a high standard of morality and conduct. This adds &lt;i&gt;burnish&lt;/i&gt; to the name and perception of the university. It is this ideal of burnishing BYU that I hope you will think about.

Years ago I collected horse brass. Most of the ones I own are copies. A horse brass is about half the size of the back of a man’s hand. Made of brass to adorn horse harnesses, they bear family crests, likenesses of royalty, animals, and a myriad other creative symbols. The point is that for the brass to have a sheen and deep glow, it must be polished or burnished. So it is with our lives. When we as individual graduates of this institution grow and progress, we add luster and patina to our alma mater and to the Lord’s Church.

Today you will formally complete this phase of your education. Armed with BYU degrees, you will leave this place that has grown sacred to you because of the academic and spiritual opportunities you have been afforded here. You too carry the responsibility to add burnish to the name Brigham Young University. It now becomes your time to demonstrate to your employers, your graduate school professors, your business colleagues, your neighbors, and your friends what a BYU education truly means.

You will represent the university and the Church in such a way that people not only will note your talents and your character but also will underline in their memories the fact that you are a product, a graduate, a representative of BYU. As Dr. Kaye Hanson of the Marriott School tells her students, “For the rest of your life, you represent BYU, whether you’re a member of the Church or not or whether you want to or not.”

Let me illustrate how some of the graduates of this great school have added significance and burnish to the reputation of the university named after Brigham Young. Each year the Alumni Association accepts applications for its highest designation, the Outstanding Alumnus Award. I have served on a number of selection committees through the years with the arduous task of designating a handful of graduates for this special honor given at Homecoming time. Those who are considered for this designation are from all fields of endeavor—people who have made a difference in their professions, their wards and stakes, their communities, and their families. Often their prominence and contributions have reached national and even international significance. They don’t nominate themselves—usually it is professional colleagues, family members, or fellow alumni who recognize the exceptional contribution of a BYU alumnus.

Stop and think for a moment what your achievements in your chosen profession may be in the next 25 to 30 years. What difference will you have made in your families, in your communities, in the Church, in your professions, or in your service to mankind?

I want to share with you a few comments made about one of our graduates who, through a life of service, has helped to burnish the Brigham Young University name. This was written by one of her seven children—six sons and one daughter—who nominated their mother for the Service to Family Award:

[Alice Schindler Cannon] &lt;i&gt;graduated from BYU in 1958 and went to law school at Duke University. Because of a long-distance courtship with our father, she moved to Illinois and graduated from the University of Illinois as a lawyer. During this time they married, and upon graduating our mother decided not to begin a law practice because she was expecting her first child. Her priority was family.&lt;/i&gt;

The letters of recommendation noted that tragedy struck this family in 1993 when an accident took their father. It was then that the award nominee assumed the role as head of the household and monitored the family construction business as secretary/treasurer. Her family further notes that she has served in virtually every Church organization and calling, including Relief Society president twice, both stake and ward Young Women president, and Primary president.

At her daughter’s report to the high council after her mission, the stake president asked this outstanding mother and BYU graduate where she had sent her children on their missions. After she replied, with tears in his eyes the stake president noted, “Sister, you have sent your children to all parts of the world to teach the gospel, and the men and women of this world honor your name.”

As a graduate, when you bring quiet or heralded honor to your own lives, you add honor to the university, to the Church, and to our Eternal Father, in whose image we are created. As your reputation grows for the good you do and the service you render, the reputation of BYU grows brighter and brighter. As noted in the Doctrine and Covenants:

&lt;i&gt;That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 50:24]

Let me mention another graduate who will be honored here on campus in October. Michael K. Young has also added luster to BYU. This Distinguished Service Award recipient has served as the president of a university and the dean of a law school, chaired a major commission for the United States government, raised a wonderful family, and served in the Church. He, too, once sat among those graduating from BYU. Through his career and service he has added burnish to the name Brigham Young University.

From the early days of Brigham Young Academy, presided over by Karl G. Maeser, came a justice of the United States Supreme Court, George Sutherland. From the days of BYU President Franklin Harris came Ezra Taft Benson, U.S. secretary of agriculture and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. From the days of President Cecil O. Samuelson will come from your very class mothers and fathers of distinction, leaders of the Church, men and women of such standing that people will say, “He or she is a graduate of Brigham Young University.” You will have added to the luster and reputation of your alma mater. You will have burnished the sacred name of Brigham Young University!

As president of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Some 370,000 alumni worldwide join me in offering our congratulations and welcome. Throughout your lifetime you will have many opportunities to join with alumni groups across the world in meaningful activities associated with this great university and in accomplishing much good. May the Class of 2008 burnish the name of Brigham Young University, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

&lt;i&gt;Bruce L. Olsen was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 14 August 2008.&lt;/i&gt;

			<p>To those who graduated before you, you owe a debt of gratitude. Because they have used their talents and educations to add to the reputation of the university, you and I can take pride in associating the name Brigham Young University with our own names and reputations. We can write BYU with confidence on applications to graduate schools, on résumés, on job applications, or on paperwork for professional societies.</p>
<p>The university has long been recognized for producing women and men of integrity. BYU graduates are known as outstanding employees, notable scholars, and respected leaders. You are among those who have been grounded and rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>President Hinckley in media interviews used to note that we are, as a people, not perfect. He would say, “We make mistakes, and we have failures.” Then we would add, “Yes, we do.”</p>
<p>Our claim is not that we have arrived in any state of perfection but that it is before us as a goal. I believe the majority of BYU graduates the world over are worthy citizens and advocates of what is true and right. They are Church members and others who live their religion the best they can and stand by a high standard of morality and conduct. This adds <i>burnish</i> to the name and perception of the university. It is this ideal of burnishing BYU that I hope you will think about.</p>
<p>Years ago I collected horse brass. Most of the ones I own are copies. A horse brass is about half the size of the back of a man’s hand. Made of brass to adorn horse harnesses, they bear family crests, likenesses of royalty, animals, and a myriad other creative symbols. The point is that for the brass to have a sheen and deep glow, it must be polished or burnished. So it is with our lives. When we as individual graduates of this institution grow and progress, we add luster and patina to our alma mater and to the Lord’s Church.</p>
<p>Today you will formally complete this phase of your education. Armed with BYU degrees, you will leave this place that has grown sacred to you because of the academic and spiritual opportunities you have been afforded here. You too carry the responsibility to add burnish to the name Brigham Young University. It now becomes your time to demonstrate to your employers, your graduate school professors, your business colleagues, your neighbors, and your friends what a BYU education truly means.</p>
<p>You will represent the university and the Church in such a way that people not only will note your talents and your character but also will underline in their memories the fact that you are a product, a graduate, a representative of BYU. As Dr. Kaye Hanson of the Marriott School tells her students, “For the rest of your life, you represent BYU, whether you’re a member of the Church or not or whether you want to or not.”</p>
<p>Let me illustrate how some of the graduates of this great school have added significance and burnish to the reputation of the university named after Brigham Young. Each year the Alumni Association accepts applications for its highest designation, the Outstanding Alumnus Award. I have served on a number of selection committees through the years with the arduous task of designating a handful of graduates for this special honor given at Homecoming time. Those who are considered for this designation are from all fields of endeavor—people who have made a difference in their professions, their wards and stakes, their communities, and their families. Often their prominence and contributions have reached national and even international significance. They don’t nominate themselves—usually it is professional colleagues, family members, or fellow alumni who recognize the exceptional contribution of a BYU alumnus.</p>
<p>Stop and think for a moment what your achievements in your chosen profession may be in the next 25 to 30 years. What difference will you have made in your families, in your communities, in the Church, in your professions, or in your service to mankind?</p>
<p>I want to share with you a few comments made about one of our graduates who, through a life of service, has helped to burnish the Brigham Young University name. This was written by one of her seven children—six sons and one daughter—who nominated their mother for the Service to Family Award:</p>
<p>[Alice Schindler Cannon] <i>graduated from BYU in 1958 and went to law school at Duke University. Because of a long-distance courtship with our father, she moved to Illinois and graduated from the University of Illinois as a lawyer. During this time they married, and upon graduating our mother decided not to begin a law practice because she was expecting her first child. Her priority was family.</i></p>
<p>The letters of recommendation noted that tragedy struck this family in 1993 when an accident took their father. It was then that the award nominee assumed the role as head of the household and monitored the family construction business as secretary/treasurer. Her family further notes that she has served in virtually every Church organization and calling, including Relief Society president twice, both stake and ward Young Women president, and Primary president.</p>
<p>At her daughter’s report to the high council after her mission, the stake president asked this outstanding mother and BYU graduate where she had sent her children on their missions. After she replied, with tears in his eyes the stake president noted, “Sister, you have sent your children to all parts of the world to teach the gospel, and the men and women of this world honor your name.”</p>
<p>As a graduate, when you bring quiet or heralded honor to your own lives, you add honor to the university, to the Church, and to our Eternal Father, in whose image we are created. As your reputation grows for the good you do and the service you render, the reputation of BYU grows brighter and brighter. As noted in the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
<p><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i> [D&amp;C 50:24]</p>
<p>Let me mention another graduate who will be honored here on campus in October. Michael K. Young has also added luster to BYU. This Distinguished Service Award recipient has served as the president of a university and the dean of a law school, chaired a major commission for the United States government, raised a wonderful family, and served in the Church. He, too, once sat among those graduating from BYU. Through his career and service he has added burnish to the name Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>From the early days of Brigham Young Academy, presided over by Karl G. Maeser, came a justice of the United States Supreme Court, George Sutherland. From the days of BYU President Franklin Harris came Ezra Taft Benson, U.S. secretary of agriculture and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. From the days of President Cecil O. Samuelson will come from your very class mothers and fathers of distinction, leaders of the Church, men and women of such standing that people will say, “He or she is a graduate of Brigham Young University.” You will have added to the luster and reputation of your alma mater. You will have burnished the sacred name of Brigham Young University!</p>
<p>As president of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Some 370,000 alumni worldwide join me in offering our congratulations and welcome. Throughout your lifetime you will have many opportunities to join with alumni groups across the world in meaningful activities associated with this great university and in accomplishing much good. May the Class of 2008 burnish the name of Brigham Young University, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
<p><i>Bruce L. Olsen was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 14 August 2008.</i></p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:
I want you to remember that you ought not to tea</span>

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
