  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Good morning. I am thankful for the prayer that has been given and for the beautiful music. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will continue to be with us.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Dad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
I would like to begin with a personal story. In 1988 I was visiting with my brothers and sisters when the conversation drifted to our father, who had passed away many years earlier. We shared our memories of Dad: his ways of doing things, his favorite sayings, our fishing trips (where all he did was bait hooks), and so forth. After enjoying the discussion for 10 or 15 minutes, I was surprised when my youngest sister started to cry. When her emotions settled down, she reminded us that she had been only six years old when our dad passed away. Though she was happy to hear us talk about our memories of Dad, she was saddened because she herself had very few memories of him.

That experience bothered me for several weeks. Being the oldest child in the family, I had many memories of my father and could not imagine life without those memories. It bothered me further when I realized that my wife and most of my siblings spouses would never meet my dad and that my children and their cousins would never know their grandfather. So I enlisted my wifes help, and for the next several months we set about compiling a book about my father. We contacted extended family, found former friends, and called work associates and Church leaders who had interacted with Dad. We asked all of them to write down their memories of him. We made copies of pictures, news articles, and documents that showed his special achievements, trying to put everything we could find about my father in a book. After many months of effort, the book was finished, and we printed copies and gave them to family members as our Christmas gift.

Although this book is of great value to our family, it does not convey anything more than a glimpse into who my father really is. To fully understand my father as an individual, one would need a much more complete book. There is such a book; the scriptures call it the book of life.

The book of life is described in the Bible Dictionary as follows: "In one sense the book of life is the sum total of ones thoughts and actions - the record of his life" (s.v. "book of life," 626). I have often desired to read from my fathers book of life. As I contemplated what I could learn about him from reading his book of life, I began to wonder about my own book and what was being recorded there.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
As an accounting professor, the idea of keeping books is nothing new. One of the many responsibilities of an accountant is to keep the books, or to record the financial activities of organizations. These books are then used by interested parties to analyze the organizations performances.

In thinking about my book of life, I wondered if I could apply to it some of the principles accountants use to keep the books of enterprises here on earth. For example, one principle of accounting is that each organization keeps its own set of books. If you want to see what Bank of America is doing, you will not find what youre looking for in the books of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson. You do not look at the books of Microsoft to see how Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is doing. The books of any enterprise are the records of the activities of that enterprise. The books of J Dawgs, the hot-dog vendor south of campus, look very different from those of McDonalds, even though the two enterprises are in the same industry. The books of an enterprise in India will differ from those of an enterprise in China or Australia - the conditions and opportunities in each country differ. The key is that every enterprise keeps its own books, and each enterprise is evaluated according to what that enterprise has done given its size, location, market, and so forth.

So it is with a book of life. My book of life will be very different from that of a friend in Atlanta, a cousin in Florida, or a professor in Chile. It will be different from that of President Samuelson, of my bishop, or of my neighbor. My book will even be different from that of my brother, of my father, or of my son. The point is that each one of us has his or her own unique book of life; we need not compare ourselves with others.

I have always found the parable of the talents to be interesting. In Matthew 25 the parable begins with a lord giving his goods to his servants. Verse 15 states, "And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."

Notice that the lord did not give each servant the same amount; he gave to each according to his individual abilities. We know that the first servant worked to increase his five talents to 10, the second servant increased his two talents to four, and the third servant buried his one talent in order to preserve what he had. Of interest to me is the lords response to the first and second servants.

In verse 21 the lord tells the first servant the following: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."

The second servant had started with fewer talents than the first and ended up with only four. But note what the lord says in verse 23: "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."

The response to the second servant is identical to - not proportional to or in any way less than - that received by the first servant. It was not a matter of comparing the second servant to the first servant; it was a matter of each being evaluated for what he did with what he was given. So it is with each one of us. It is not a matter of being compared to others; it is a matter of what we do with what we have been given.

In a very small way, early on in my life I had a taste of this type of judgment. Some of you may have noticed that I came to this earth with a body that has a few odd parts. Fortunately, and at times unfortunately, the competitive spirit I came with far exceeds my physical capabilities. In the eighth grade I took a PE course, and I vowed to get an A in that course. Unfortunately, pull-ups were a problem for me, rope climbing was not good, and several other requirements of the class presented me with major challenges. At the end of the term I received a C for my achievement in the course. I was devastated and just a bit concerned about what my father would say.

When I got home, Dad looked at the grade and said, "Great! Straight A! I am proud of you."

You see, the school reported two grades for every class: one grade for achievement (that was the C that I received) and one grade for effort. Dad only looked at the grade for effort. As long as my effort was an "A"-level effort, the level of achievement was not a concern to him. As long as we do the best we can with whatever we are given in this life, our efforts will be accepted by our Heavenly Father. We need not compare ourselves with others.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Principle of Balance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Another principle of accounting that can be applied to our personal book of life is that of balance. Many of you here today have taken Accounting 200. One of the first things students learn in Accounting 200 is that everything is in balance: debits always equal credits. All transactions have a debit and an equally sized credit - no exceptions. If you get a machine, you either give up cash or incur debt. If you recognize revenue, you recognize cash or a receipt. The books are always in balance.

What about balance in our book of life? I think it is fair to say that at the very basic level we all know that if we do what is right, we will be blessed. And, conversely, we know that if we do not do what is right, we will not be blessed. In the book of life, things must balance - debits equal credits.

The way God gives us blessings is an example of this concept. D&amp;amp;C 130:2021 states:

&lt;i&gt;There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.&lt;/i&gt;

Obedience brings blessings. Everything is in balance. Debits equal credits.

Another example of the principle of balance is found in 3 Nephi 14:78:

&lt;i&gt;Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.&lt;/i&gt;

Think of the Word of Wisdom, the sacrament prayer, and other such teachings in which a given action is promised to result in certain blessings. In the book of life, debits equal credits.

There are times in each of our lives when we may feel that doing what is right does not result in blessings or that our prayers are not being answered or that a particular challenge is just too much. In essence, we question the existence of balance as it applies to our life.

I have a young nephew who went to work this last summer on a road-paving crew in order to earn money for his mission. One day a car on the other side of the divided highway crossed the median and all lanes of traffic and pinned my nephew against a concrete barrier. He had been looking the other way and never even saw the car. Although my nephew felt blessed to have escaped death, his left foot was crushed. After months of trying to save the foot, the doctors amputated it last month.

One might ask, "Why? This is a good young man working to fund a mission so that he can serve the Lord, and, through no fault of his own, he suddenly finds himself in bed for six months trying to heal his foot - only to have it amputated. Why? Where is the balance?"

We are not alone in these feelings. Sections 121 and 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants were given to the Prophet Joseph Smith while he was in Liberty Jail. In verses 1 through 6 of section 121 the Prophet pleaded with the Lord to remember the Saints in their suffering. In verses 7 and 8 the Lord responded to the Prophet by saying:

&lt;i&gt;My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.&lt;/i&gt;

As if to emphasize His point, in section 122 the Lord told the Prophet Joseph that even if he was "called to pass through tribulation," "accused with all manner of false accusations," torn from family and friends, "cast into the pit," sentenced to death, and, above all, chased after by the very depths of hell, he would gain experience and it would be for his good (D&amp;amp;C 122:57). Debits equal credits. Although we may not see it, and we experience much pain and suffering in the process, everything in our book of life is, when considered in the eternal sense, in balance.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three Reports&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The books of every enterprise have three basic reports. The statement of cash flow describes the liquidity of an enterprise. Any enterprise must have enough cash to make needed payments, regardless of how well the enterprise is doing in other areas, or it will fail. The second report is the income statement. An income statement describes how an enterprise has done financially over a period of time. The third report is the balance sheet. This statement conveys a picture of how the enterprise is doing financially at any point in time. The balance sheet holds the cumulative result of operations over the life of the enterprise. As I think about my book of life, I can clearly see three similar reports.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Spiritual Cash Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Like many of you, I have been asked at times to respond to a plea for help or to comfort someone in pain or anguish or to give a priesthood blessing. To respond to requests like these, we need a reservoir of righteousness - a reserve of spiritual cash if you will. When these requests come, it is past time to prepare; you either have the spiritual cash on hand or you dont. There is not a more terrible feeling than to be asked to exercise spirituality when you have not built a reserve. What you may have done in the past or what you may do in the future does not really help when you are faced with the need for the Spirit now.

How is your spiritual cash flow? The way to build your spiritual reservoir has been clearly outlined: be faithful in your daily prayers and daily scripture study and keep the commandments. Keep your spiritual cash reserve full.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Spiritual Income Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
All enterprises periodically give an accounting of how they have done over the past year or over some other period of time. All revenues, or inflows, are reported along with all expenses, or outflows. The netting of the revenues and the expenses results in a net income figure. When revenues exceed expenses, there is a net gain; when revenues are less than expenses, there is a net loss.

How is your spiritual income statement? Hopefully in our personal prayers at the end of each day we are giving an accounting to the Lord of our daily activities. How has the day gone? Are the spiritual revenues greater than the spiritual expenses that day? Regular interviews with parents allow us to give an accounting of what we have been doing since our last discussion. Visiting teaching interviews and priesthood interviews for home teaching give us an opportunity to look at our income statement regarding those responsibilities. All of us have had, I hope, the experience of having an interview with our bishop in which he asked us to give an accounting of our activities. Renewing our temple recommends and attending annual tithing settlements are additional occasions through which we can review our spiritual income statements.

In business, almost all companies go through cycles of good years and not-so-good years. Some companies begin with a splash, doing extremely well for a few years, and then, because of changes in the economy or challenges in their particular market, they just seem to fade away. Some companies struggle to get going and finally have a major breakthrough. Often these companies are satisfied with their newfound net income and simply ride that success for as long as it will go. The best companies are those that work continually to deal with the challenges that come and show steady positive net income year after year.

People act in a similar fashion. Some individuals enter a ward with a splash of activity and participation when life is going well, only to withdraw when challenges come. Some individuals are engaged in one activity or position and ride that for the rest of their lives. I have met many less-active members who will spend hours talking about their missionary service as if it justifies their current lack of involvement. Remember, net income is measured for each period of time, and a positive net income one year does not automatically result in a positive net income during any other year. How is your spiritual net income?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Eternal Balance Sheet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third report found in all organizations is the balance sheet. The balance sheet shows the financial state of an enterprise at any point in time. It shows the assets of the enterprise - assets being cash, inventory, buildings, and land, things that an enterprise uses for its operations. On the other side, the balance sheet shows the liabilities; liabilities are what the enterprise owes to others, such as accounts payable, loans payable, and notes payable. The balance sheet also shows the equity, or total amount invested into and earnings retained in the enterprise by the owners. On every balance sheet, assets equal liabilities plus the owners equity.

As I think of the balance sheet of my life, I doubt that the assets listed include cash, land, buildings, or other such temporal items. The assets in this type of balance sheet can be found in D&amp;amp;C 4:56:

&lt;i&gt;And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.&lt;/i&gt;

The sixth section of &lt;i&gt;Preach My Gospel&lt;/i&gt; describes these as Christlike attributes (assets) and adds obedience to the list.

Take a moment to think about someone outside of your family who has been a major influence for good in your life. What is it about this person that you remember? I think of an old Scout leader of mine named Charlie Murray. Brother Murray would spend hours with us boys at camps and working on service projects. I really enjoyed being with him because he was fun and would really tell us what he thought about what we were doing in our lives. How he survived winter camp with the 20-plus Scouts in our troop is still a marvel to me.

Now consider the person you have identified and think about what makes that individual special. Let me suggest that what makes this person special is his or her level of faith or hope or charity, or the balance of any of the assets in their balance sheet of life. What makes them special is not the amount of money, the size of the home, the amount of property, or the amount of any other of their worldly assets.

Let me return for a moment to the question I posed earlier about why good people face difficult, sometimes painful, challenges. When all is going well in my life, I find it difficult to develop tolerance or to build my patience or to work on my humility. If things are going well, hope is not a problem, and temperance comes easily. Many, if not most, of the assets in our eternal balance sheet can really only be increased when we are working through challenges and difficulties. Perhaps when we are faced with what seem to be unfair burdens or when our lives seem unduly difficult, we should ask "How do I respond to this so that I build my balance of faith, hope, charity, and so forth?" instead of asking "Why me?" or "Why did this happen?" I do not in any way minimize the challenges we face and the pain we might feel as we undergo trials, but our attitude and perspective can make a significant difference in how we deal with the struggles of life.

On the other side of the balance sheet of life are liabilities and the owners equity. We all have a good idea of what the liabilities are in our books. Every time we fail to keep a commandment, we increase our liability balance.

The owners equity section of any balance sheet starts with the contributions of the owners of the enterprise. Consider that everything we have, including life itself, is from the Creator. Further, the blessings we receive throughout our lives come from obedience to His commandments and adherence to the covenants we have made. In essence, whatever equity we started with and any increase that has occurred in it is from our Lord - the Lord is the owner of the owners equity section of our balance sheet of life. Even more wondrous is that, through the Atonement, Christ has already paid for our liabilities (sins). The scriptures tell us repeatedly that our liabilities will be forgiven us if we repent. For example, Mosiah 26:30 states, "Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me."

Do we realize what an incredible blessing this is? The Lord has paid for all our liabilities, and they will be eliminated eternally from our balance sheet of life if we repent and keep the commandments.

How is your balance sheet in your book of life? How are the balances in your asset accounts of faith, hope, charity, love, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, humility, diligence, and obedience? How is your liability balance, and have you made use of the offer of the Lord to take all liabilities from you?
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Book of Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
At some point we will go before our Father in Heaven to give an accounting of our activities from our time on this earth. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin stated it this way:

&lt;i&gt;Each of you has an eternal calling from which no Church officer has authority to release you. This is a calling given you by our Heavenly Father Himself. In this eternal calling, as with all other callings, you have a stewardship, and "it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity."&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 72:3] &lt;i&gt;This most important stewardship is the glorious responsibility your Father in Heaven has given you to watch over and care for your own soul.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;At some future day, you and I will each hear the voice of the Lord calling us forward to render an account of our mortal stewardship.&lt;/i&gt; [Joseph B. Wirthlin, "True to the Truth," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1997, 16]

Keeping a written history of our life on earth is a very important responsibility. Such histories bind generations of families together. I certainly encourage all to write personal histories.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that we are all, day by day, moment by moment, writing our book of life. Although not written on paper, the entries in this book are just as real and will have an eternal impact.

When I was born I had a number of physical challenges, the most serious being a deformity of the heart. At the age of nine I had open-heart surgery, which at the time was in an early experimental stage. I was given a 50/50 chance of surviving the surgery and a chance that the surgery would be successful. Obviously I survived the surgery, and I have had no heart problems since.

Looking back at that time, there were two truths I knew then, and I still know today. The first was that the Lord knew me individually and was watching over me. I knew He loved me, and because of that everything would be okay - regardless of what I had to go through. That knowledge has been a tremendous blessing as I have faced the various challenges in my life.

The second was that I had been given many blessings and my life has a purpose. I also knew that with these blessings came a tremendous responsibility to do all I could to be worthy of that which I had been given.

The same is true for each of you. The Lord knows you individually and is watching over you. He loves you and wants only the best for you. He is there for you through the challenges of life as you seek Him in prayer. Each of us has a responsibility to live such that our book of life reflects actions taken that will permit us to return to live with Him forever. Of this I testify in the name of

&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Good morning. I am thankful for the prayer that has been given and for the beautiful music. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will continue to be with us.</p>
<h2><b>My Dad</b></h2>
<p>I would like to begin with a personal story. In 1988 I was visiting with my brothers and sisters when the conversation drifted to our father, who had passed away many years earlier. We shared our memories of Dad: his ways of doing things, his favorite sayings, our fishing trips (where all he did was bait hooks), and so forth. After enjoying the discussion for 10 or 15 minutes, I was surprised when my youngest sister started to cry. When her emotions settled down, she reminded us that she had been only six years old when our dad passed away. Though she was happy to hear us talk about our memories of Dad, she was saddened because she herself had very few memories of him.</p>
<p>That experience bothered me for several weeks. Being the oldest child in the family, I had many memories of my father and could not imagine life without those memories. It bothered me further when I realized that my wife and most of my siblings spouses would never meet my dad and that my children and their cousins would never know their grandfather. So I enlisted my wifes help, and for the next several months we set about compiling a book about my father. We contacted extended family, found former friends, and called work associates and Church leaders who had interacted with Dad. We asked all of them to write down their memories of him. We made copies of pictures, news articles, and documents that showed his special achievements, trying to put everything we could find about my father in a book. After many months of effort, the book was finished, and we printed copies and gave them to family members as our Christmas gift.</p>
<p>Although this book is of great value to our family, it does not convey anything more than a glimpse into who my father really is. To fully understand my father as an individual, one would need a much more complete book. There is such a book; the scriptures call it the book of life.</p>
<p>The book of life is described in the Bible Dictionary as follows: "In one sense the book of life is the sum total of ones thoughts and actions - the record of his life" (s.v. "book of life," 626). I have often desired to read from my fathers book of life. As I contemplated what I could learn about him from reading his book of life, I began to wonder about my own book and what was being recorded there.</p>
<h2><b>Keeping Books</b></h2>
<p>As an accounting professor, the idea of keeping books is nothing new. One of the many responsibilities of an accountant is to keep the books, or to record the financial activities of organizations. These books are then used by interested parties to analyze the organizations performances.</p>
<p>In thinking about my book of life, I wondered if I could apply to it some of the principles accountants use to keep the books of enterprises here on earth. For example, one principle of accounting is that each organization keeps its own set of books. If you want to see what Bank of America is doing, you will not find what youre looking for in the books of Johnson &amp; Johnson. You do not look at the books of Microsoft to see how Barnes &amp; Noble is doing. The books of any enterprise are the records of the activities of that enterprise. The books of J Dawgs, the hot-dog vendor south of campus, look very different from those of McDonalds, even though the two enterprises are in the same industry. The books of an enterprise in India will differ from those of an enterprise in China or Australia - the conditions and opportunities in each country differ. The key is that every enterprise keeps its own books, and each enterprise is evaluated according to what that enterprise has done given its size, location, market, and so forth.</p>
<p>So it is with a book of life. My book of life will be very different from that of a friend in Atlanta, a cousin in Florida, or a professor in Chile. It will be different from that of President Samuelson, of my bishop, or of my neighbor. My book will even be different from that of my brother, of my father, or of my son. The point is that each one of us has his or her own unique book of life; we need not compare ourselves with others.</p>
<p>I have always found the parable of the talents to be interesting. In Matthew 25 the parable begins with a lord giving his goods to his servants. Verse 15 states, "And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."</p>
<p>Notice that the lord did not give each servant the same amount; he gave to each according to his individual abilities. We know that the first servant worked to increase his five talents to 10, the second servant increased his two talents to four, and the third servant buried his one talent in order to preserve what he had. Of interest to me is the lords response to the first and second servants.</p>
<p>In verse 21 the lord tells the first servant the following: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."</p>
<p>The second servant had started with fewer talents than the first and ended up with only four. But note what the lord says in verse 23: "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."</p>
<p>The response to the second servant is identical to - not proportional to or in any way less than - that received by the first servant. It was not a matter of comparing the second servant to the first servant; it was a matter of each being evaluated for what he did with what he was given. So it is with each one of us. It is not a matter of being compared to others; it is a matter of what we do with what we have been given.</p>
<p>In a very small way, early on in my life I had a taste of this type of judgment. Some of you may have noticed that I came to this earth with a body that has a few odd parts. Fortunately, and at times unfortunately, the competitive spirit I came with far exceeds my physical capabilities. In the eighth grade I took a PE course, and I vowed to get an A in that course. Unfortunately, pull-ups were a problem for me, rope climbing was not good, and several other requirements of the class presented me with major challenges. At the end of the term I received a C for my achievement in the course. I was devastated and just a bit concerned about what my father would say.</p>
<p>When I got home, Dad looked at the grade and said, "Great! Straight A! I am proud of you."</p>
<p>You see, the school reported two grades for every class: one grade for achievement (that was the C that I received) and one grade for effort. Dad only looked at the grade for effort. As long as my effort was an "A"-level effort, the level of achievement was not a concern to him. As long as we do the best we can with whatever we are given in this life, our efforts will be accepted by our Heavenly Father. We need not compare ourselves with others.</p>
<h2><b>The Principle of Balance</b></h2>
<p>Another principle of accounting that can be applied to our personal book of life is that of balance. Many of you here today have taken Accounting 200. One of the first things students learn in Accounting 200 is that everything is in balance: debits always equal credits. All transactions have a debit and an equally sized credit - no exceptions. If you get a machine, you either give up cash or incur debt. If you recognize revenue, you recognize cash or a receipt. The books are always in balance.</p>
<p>What about balance in our book of life? I think it is fair to say that at the very basic level we all know that if we do what is right, we will be blessed. And, conversely, we know that if we do not do what is right, we will not be blessed. In the book of life, things must balance - debits equal credits.</p>
<p>The way God gives us blessings is an example of this concept. D&amp;C 130:2021 states:</p>
<p><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated - </i></p>
<p><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i></p>
<p>Obedience brings blessings. Everything is in balance. Debits equal credits.</p>
<p>Another example of the principle of balance is found in 3 Nephi 14:78:</p>
<p><i>Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i></p>
<p><i>For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</i></p>
<p>Think of the Word of Wisdom, the sacrament prayer, and other such teachings in which a given action is promised to result in certain blessings. In the book of life, debits equal credits.</p>
<p>There are times in each of our lives when we may feel that doing what is right does not result in blessings or that our prayers are not being answered or that a particular challenge is just too much. In essence, we question the existence of balance as it applies to our life.</p>
<p>I have a young nephew who went to work this last summer on a road-paving crew in order to earn money for his mission. One day a car on the other side of the divided highway crossed the median and all lanes of traffic and pinned my nephew against a concrete barrier. He had been looking the other way and never even saw the car. Although my nephew felt blessed to have escaped death, his left foot was crushed. After months of trying to save the foot, the doctors amputated it last month.</p>
<p>One might ask, "Why? This is a good young man working to fund a mission so that he can serve the Lord, and, through no fault of his own, he suddenly finds himself in bed for six months trying to heal his foot - only to have it amputated. Why? Where is the balance?"</p>
<p>We are not alone in these feelings. Sections 121 and 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants were given to the Prophet Joseph Smith while he was in Liberty Jail. In verses 1 through 6 of section 121 the Prophet pleaded with the Lord to remember the Saints in their suffering. In verses 7 and 8 the Lord responded to the Prophet by saying:</p>
<p><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i></p>
<p><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i></p>
<p>As if to emphasize His point, in section 122 the Lord told the Prophet Joseph that even if he was "called to pass through tribulation," "accused with all manner of false accusations," torn from family and friends, "cast into the pit," sentenced to death, and, above all, chased after by the very depths of hell, he would gain experience and it would be for his good (D&amp;C 122:57). Debits equal credits. Although we may not see it, and we experience much pain and suffering in the process, everything in our book of life is, when considered in the eternal sense, in balance.</p>
<h2><b>Three Reports</b></h2>
<p>The books of every enterprise have three basic reports. The statement of cash flow describes the liquidity of an enterprise. Any enterprise must have enough cash to make needed payments, regardless of how well the enterprise is doing in other areas, or it will fail. The second report is the income statement. An income statement describes how an enterprise has done financially over a period of time. The third report is the balance sheet. This statement conveys a picture of how the enterprise is doing financially at any point in time. The balance sheet holds the cumulative result of operations over the life of the enterprise. As I think about my book of life, I can clearly see three similar reports.</p>
<h2><b>A Spiritual Cash Flow</b></h2>
<p>Like many of you, I have been asked at times to respond to a plea for help or to comfort someone in pain or anguish or to give a priesthood blessing. To respond to requests like these, we need a reservoir of righteousness - a reserve of spiritual cash if you will. When these requests come, it is past time to prepare; you either have the spiritual cash on hand or you dont. There is not a more terrible feeling than to be asked to exercise spirituality when you have not built a reserve. What you may have done in the past or what you may do in the future does not really help when you are faced with the need for the Spirit now.</p>
<p>How is your spiritual cash flow? The way to build your spiritual reservoir has been clearly outlined: be faithful in your daily prayers and daily scripture study and keep the commandments. Keep your spiritual cash reserve full.</p>
<h2><b>A Spiritual Income Statement</b></h2>
<p>All enterprises periodically give an accounting of how they have done over the past year or over some other period of time. All revenues, or inflows, are reported along with all expenses, or outflows. The netting of the revenues and the expenses results in a net income figure. When revenues exceed expenses, there is a net gain; when revenues are less than expenses, there is a net loss.</p>
<p>How is your spiritual income statement? Hopefully in our personal prayers at the end of each day we are giving an accounting to the Lord of our daily activities. How has the day gone? Are the spiritual revenues greater than the spiritual expenses that day? Regular interviews with parents allow us to give an accounting of what we have been doing since our last discussion. Visiting teaching interviews and priesthood interviews for home teaching give us an opportunity to look at our income statement regarding those responsibilities. All of us have had, I hope, the experience of having an interview with our bishop in which he asked us to give an accounting of our activities. Renewing our temple recommends and attending annual tithing settlements are additional occasions through which we can review our spiritual income statements.</p>
<p>In business, almost all companies go through cycles of good years and not-so-good years. Some companies begin with a splash, doing extremely well for a few years, and then, because of changes in the economy or challenges in their particular market, they just seem to fade away. Some companies struggle to get going and finally have a major breakthrough. Often these companies are satisfied with their newfound net income and simply ride that success for as long as it will go. The best companies are those that work continually to deal with the challenges that come and show steady positive net income year after year.</p>
<p>People act in a similar fashion. Some individuals enter a ward with a splash of activity and participation when life is going well, only to withdraw when challenges come. Some individuals are engaged in one activity or position and ride that for the rest of their lives. I have met many less-active members who will spend hours talking about their missionary service as if it justifies their current lack of involvement. Remember, net income is measured for each period of time, and a positive net income one year does not automatically result in a positive net income during any other year. How is your spiritual net income?</p>
<h2><b>An Eternal Balance Sheet</b></h2>
<p>The third report found in all organizations is the balance sheet. The balance sheet shows the financial state of an enterprise at any point in time. It shows the assets of the enterprise - assets being cash, inventory, buildings, and land, things that an enterprise uses for its operations. On the other side, the balance sheet shows the liabilities; liabilities are what the enterprise owes to others, such as accounts payable, loans payable, and notes payable. The balance sheet also shows the equity, or total amount invested into and earnings retained in the enterprise by the owners. On every balance sheet, assets equal liabilities plus the owners equity.</p>
<p>As I think of the balance sheet of my life, I doubt that the assets listed include cash, land, buildings, or other such temporal items. The assets in this type of balance sheet can be found in D&amp;C 4:56:</p>
<p><i>And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.</i></p>
<p><i>Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.</i></p>
<p>The sixth section of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> describes these as Christlike attributes (assets) and adds obedience to the list.</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about someone outside of your family who has been a major influence for good in your life. What is it about this person that you remember? I think of an old Scout leader of mine named Charlie Murray. Brother Murray would spend hours with us boys at camps and working on service projects. I really enjoyed being with him because he was fun and would really tell us what he thought about what we were doing in our lives. How he survived winter camp with the 20-plus Scouts in our troop is still a marvel to me.</p>
<p>Now consider the person you have identified and think about what makes that individual special. Let me suggest that what makes this person special is his or her level of faith or hope or charity, or the balance of any of the assets in their balance sheet of life. What makes them special is not the amount of money, the size of the home, the amount of property, or the amount of any other of their worldly assets.</p>
<p>Let me return for a moment to the question I posed earlier about why good people face difficult, sometimes painful, challenges. When all is going well in my life, I find it difficult to develop tolerance or to build my patience or to work on my humility. If things are going well, hope is not a problem, and temperance comes easily. Many, if not most, of the assets in our eternal balance sheet can really only be increased when we are working through challenges and difficulties. Perhaps when we are faced with what seem to be unfair burdens or when our lives seem unduly difficult, we should ask "How do I respond to this so that I build my balance of faith, hope, charity, and so forth?" instead of asking "Why me?" or "Why did this happen?" I do not in any way minimize the challenges we face and the pain we might feel as we undergo trials, but our attitude and perspective can make a significant difference in how we deal with the struggles of life.</p>
<p>On the other side of the balance sheet of life are liabilities and the owners equity. We all have a good idea of what the liabilities are in our books. Every time we fail to keep a commandment, we increase our liability balance.</p>
<p>The owners equity section of any balance sheet starts with the contributions of the owners of the enterprise. Consider that everything we have, including life itself, is from the Creator. Further, the blessings we receive throughout our lives come from obedience to His commandments and adherence to the covenants we have made. In essence, whatever equity we started with and any increase that has occurred in it is from our Lord - the Lord is the owner of the owners equity section of our balance sheet of life. Even more wondrous is that, through the Atonement, Christ has already paid for our liabilities (sins). The scriptures tell us repeatedly that our liabilities will be forgiven us if we repent. For example, Mosiah 26:30 states, "Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me."</p>
<p>Do we realize what an incredible blessing this is? The Lord has paid for all our liabilities, and they will be eliminated eternally from our balance sheet of life if we repent and keep the commandments.</p>
<p>How is your balance sheet in your book of life? How are the balances in your asset accounts of faith, hope, charity, love, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, humility, diligence, and obedience? How is your liability balance, and have you made use of the offer of the Lord to take all liabilities from you?</p>
<h2><b>Your Book of Life</b></h2>
<p>At some point we will go before our Father in Heaven to give an accounting of our activities from our time on this earth. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin stated it this way:</p>
<p><i>Each of you has an eternal calling from which no Church officer has authority to release you. This is a calling given you by our Heavenly Father Himself. In this eternal calling, as with all other callings, you have a stewardship, and "it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity."</i> [D&amp;C 72:3] <i>This most important stewardship is the glorious responsibility your Father in Heaven has given you to watch over and care for your own soul.</i></p>
<p><i>At some future day, you and I will each hear the voice of the Lord calling us forward to render an account of our mortal stewardship.</i> [Joseph B. Wirthlin, "True to the Truth," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1997, 16]</p>
<p>Keeping a written history of our life on earth is a very important responsibility. Such histories bind generations of families together. I certainly encourage all to write personal histories.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to recognize that we are all, day by day, moment by moment, writing our book of life. Although not written on paper, the entries in this book are just as real and will have an eternal impact.</p>
<p>When I was born I had a number of physical challenges, the most serious being a deformity of the heart. At the age of nine I had open-heart surgery, which at the time was in an early experimental stage. I was given a 50/50 chance of surviving the surgery and a chance that the surgery would be successful. Obviously I survived the surgery, and I have had no heart problems since.</p>
<p>Looking back at that time, there were two truths I knew then, and I still know today. The first was that the Lord knew me individually and was watching over me. I knew He loved me, and because of that everything would be okay - regardless of what I had to go through. That knowledge has been a tremendous blessing as I have faced the various challenges in my life.</p>
<p>The second was that I had been given many blessings and my life has a purpose. I also knew that with these blessings came a tremendous responsibility to do all I could to be worthy of that which I had been given.</p>
<p>The same is true for each of you. The Lord knows you individually and is watching over you. He loves you and wants only the best for you. He is there for you through the challenges of life as you seek Him in prayer. Each of us has a responsibility to live such that our book of life reflects actions taken that will permit us to return to live with Him forever. Of this I testify in the name of</p>
<p><i></i>Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how I feel when I am with you.
What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.
I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:
On the day you were born, you cried and your family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.1
What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.
Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on - and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy - one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.
In some ways this statement is the practical essence of Gods plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch - choices that help us become.
I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:
Yesterdays the past, tomorrows the future, but today is a gift. Thats why its called the present.2
With this gift of time, you wont always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what happens to you.
Develop your legacy intentionally. Determine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.
Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.
First Secret
God has given us two things in life: time and the opportunity to choose what you do with it.
This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We cant refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of "outstanding life and contribution to society and the world."
Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, "With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor."
Then my daughter exclaimed, "What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given only to people without a PhD!"
This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xian Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.
As the Chinese saying goes, "Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well." Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer - now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater - in Chinese, "the mother school."
For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, "As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them."
Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, I emphasize, talents.
To recall my experience, the BYU motto "Go forth to serve" has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.
First, "go forth to serve" could mean confidence and dedication in the pursuit of ones undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Hi, everybody! To all of you - graduates, parents, and other supporters - thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.
I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.
The Story
Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbruck, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.
All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?
My Experience
Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.
As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they dont. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests - like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.
The Thought
That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Congratulations to all of you newly minted BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the greatest universities in the world. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.
As you know, the mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesnt end, the quest doesnt end, and our relationships dont end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical The Wiz. At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didnt know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: "Believe in yourself as I believe in you." It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together ("Believe in Yourself," The Wiz [1978]).
Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.
