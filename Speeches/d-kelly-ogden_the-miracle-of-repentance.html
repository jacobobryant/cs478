  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="There is no principle of the gospel more important than repentance. At least that is what the Lord seems to be saying in the scriptures. Several times He instructed His servants to "say nothing but repentance unto this generation" (D&amp;amp;C 6:9; 11:9; see also 19:21). Does He mean that literally? Is every topic of all the missionary lessons supposed to be repentance? Does repentance have to be the subject of every Church classroom discussion? Of course not. Why did He say it that way then?

The Lord was using a figure of speech called hyperbole, which is an intentional exaggeration to emphasize a point. He said it in a hyperbolic way to stress that there is nothing more important in all the gospel than getting people to repent. This one principle is so vital that it towers above all others in primacy and urgency. Driven by faith, repentance is the single most important principle to live in order to make the Saviors Atonement effective and meaningful in our lives.

Repentance is not just feeling guilty for having sinned, nor is it mere "forgetfulness," pushing the sin way back in our mind to conveniently not be reminded of it. It is an attitude change and a behavior change. We repent not only of sins but also &lt;i&gt;of sinning, &lt;/i&gt;and we are willing to do whatever is necessary to remove the stain and the pain. We turn to the Savior. He is the only one who can take away our sins because He paid the price for them.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Godly Sorrow and Suffering Are Necessary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
In true repentance, godly sorrow and suffering are necessary. According to the scriptures, if you havent suffered, you havent repented. We have all been through the anguish. Sometimes we feel like pounding our head against the wall, wondering how we could be so foolish as to do the sinful things we do. We hurt inside. And it is not just guilt for being caught or feeling the embarrassment for having to confess. It is godly sorrow we are feeling.

Years ago I saw a painting in an old &lt;i&gt;Instructor&lt;/i&gt; magazine entitled &lt;i&gt;Turning Toward the Light&lt;/i&gt; (by Ray W. Hellberg, center spread between pages 20 and 21 in "Four Faces of Repentance," &lt;i&gt;Instructor,&lt;/i&gt; January 1965). It made quite an impression on me. It portrays the stages a person goes through to be totally rid of his or her sins - from the agonizing pain of darkness to the glimmer of hope and recognition that there is a Light we can turn to and then to fully committing to dedicate ourselves to that Light.

Who is it in scripture that comes to your mind that has given us the most detailed, the most graphic portrayal of the pains of a damned soul? You probably think first of Alma the Younger, and we are glad that he was willing to divulge, and actually carve into the record, those intimate and agonizing details of what he went through to be forgiven of his sins (see Mosiah 27:2829 and Alma 36:1217).

He described wading through tribulation, the bitterness, the bonds, the abyss, and the inexpressible horror at the thought of having to stand before God and answer for all he had done. Alma wrote that he was "harrowed up" by the memory of his many sins. What is a harrow? Those involved in cultivating field crops know that it is an implement that is dragged behind an animal (and now behind a tractor) to break up the hard ground for planting. If a harrow were dragged over a live body, it would certainly become an instrument of torture. Alma also wrote that he was racked with torment. What is a rack? An instrument of torture. Alma chose his words intentionally; he was tortured by his sins, just as is the man portrayed in the painting.

Alma later taught his own wayward son, one who was sinning grievously while serving a mission, "Let your sins trouble you" - meaning what? Let your sins bother you to bring you down to severe depression? No. Alma said, "Let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance" (Alma 42:29). Be glad to suffer the godly sorrow now so you wont have to suffer the full effects of your sins later.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confession Is Necessary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
President Spencer W. Kimball taught:

&lt;i&gt;No one can ever be forgiven of any transgression until there is repentance, and one has not repented until he has bared his soul and admitted his intentions and weaknesses without excuses or rationalizations. He must admit to himself that he has grievously sinned. When he has confessed to himself without the slightest minimizing of the offense, or rationalizing its seriousness, or soft-pedaling its gravity, and admits it is as &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; as it really &lt;strong&gt;is,&lt;/strong&gt; then he is ready to begin his repentance.&lt;/i&gt; ["&lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_love-vs-lust/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Love Versus Lust&lt;/a&gt;," BYU devotional address, 5 January 1965; emphasis in original]

We have a worry these days. Many in this generation seem to be growing up with the carefree attitude "I can sin now, and I can always repent later. It only takes a few months of waiting and I can go on a mission or I can go to the temple." But Elder Richard G. Scott warned, "The thought of intentionally committing serious sin now and repenting later is perilously wrong. . . . Premeditated sin has greater penalties and is harder to overcome" ("&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/10/making-the-right-choices?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Making the Right Choices&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; November 1994, 3839).

We must confess and forsake our sins now and not put off our repentance. Alma warned us not to procrastinate the day of our repentance. As the old rabbis used to say: You cannot repent the day before you die, because you dont know what day you will die.

When we returned to Utah in 2000 after our mission in Chile, we found our oldest daughter dating a young man named McKell, a lively returned missionary who was also involved in theater programs at Brigham Young University. He was a frequent visitor in our home, and we came to like him.

That fall our daughter was awakened one Sunday morning to hear some terrible news. Her friend McKell had been visiting a cousin along the Oregon coast, and the two of them were far out on a pier when a storm came up suddenly and swept them off into the water. His cousin was battered among some rocks and was rushed off to a hospital, where he struggled for his life. McKell was apparently swept away by the undertow, and his body was not recovered. Eight days later, the very day of a memorial service for him, his body washed up onto the shore and could finally have a proper burial.

McKell was a good young man, just twenty-five years old. I dont believe he knew that he would be leaving the earth that day.

Sister Davidson was one of our extraordinary sister missionaries in Chile. When she finished her mission she returned to school at BYU and continued serving in her ward. One Sunday afternoon while crossing the street near her apartment, she was struck by a car and killed. She was on her way to a meeting and found herself on the way to a different meeting. I spoke in a memorial service for her a few days later. I dont believe Sister Davidson knew she would be leaving the earth that day.

The fact is, none of us knows exactly when we will be departing this mortal sphere, so we should be ready always - never procrastinating the day of our repentance but repenting daily and keeping ourselves prepared to meet God.

Dont wait until the pressure situations of mission and marriage arrive to do your repenting. If the announcements and invitations have already been sent out and you have the interview with the bishop and a member of the stake presidency, and then you realize together that you are not ready for the sacred covenant-making in the house of the Lord - then what do you do? It could be pretty embarrassing, couldnt it? The embarrassment doesnt matter; you dont ever want to enter the holy temple if you are not worthy. To take upon yourself the most sacred covenants and make the most binding promises of your whole life when you are not spiritually prepared or worthy to do so would bring upon you serious condemnation.

Before going to the temple, before going to sacrament meeting, even before kneeling to pray, be reconciled to Heavenly Father and to the Savior - and if there is any conflict or friction between you and any other person, get it resolved now.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forsaking Our Sins Is Necessary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The scriptures teach that forsaking our sins is necessary. The Lord said, "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins - behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43). To forsake means to give up, abandon. Indeed, we must abandon all sin as soon as we can - and it might require a lengthy and mighty struggle to rid ourselves of our toughest and most perplexing weaknesses. It is essential, as soon as possible, to expel sin from our lives. That is forsaking.

There is another angle for us to look at regarding the forsaking of sins. When I was first called to work with the missionaries at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, I quickly learned that by far most of the elders and sisters were prepared and worthy to be there. Those who were not soon found that they couldnt learn the lessons and they couldnt learn to love their companion; nothing seemed to go right because they couldnt get the Spirit, and they couldnt get the Spirit because they were not clean. Those few had to return home and repent, and then many of them were able to return to the MTC and make it work.

Although the great majority of the missionaries were prepared and worthy to be there - learning to represent the Lord Jesus Christ - I noticed that even among them there were some who caught themselves agonizing over past sins. They had fully repented, but they still had a bright recollection of their recent (and sometimes distant) sins, and they became depressed as they remembered the gross sins of their past. What hadnt they done? They hadnt forsaken those sins in yet another sense. Part of forsaking is forgiving yourself and putting the sins behind you - burying the old man of sin, as the apostle Paul put it (see Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:1112) - and leaving them buried and not digging them up anymore.

Sometimes people will sincerely desire to repent and secure Heavenly Fathers complete forgiveness, saying to the Savior, "Here, Lord. Here is my whole package of sin. Please take it away."

And He does.

Then we go back and say, "Wait a minute. Give me some of those sins back; I want to suffer a little more for them!"

No. When you have totally repented, you must forsake those sins, forget about them, bury them away, and not bring them up again. Jesus beautifully stated the principle in agricultural terms: "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62). In other words, when you have planted your life in a more spiritual furrow, keep your eyes straight ahead and dont look back to the old sins, the old people, the old places. Someone has suggested that when Satan reminds you of your past, just remind him of his future! Keep your eyes looking ahead and on the Savior.

I really like some words from Isaiah 54:4: "Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth." I am taking those words out of their historical context, but I find the phrase itself profoundly meaningful. We all know that nobody gets through teenage years unscathed. Everyone has problems growing up - some worse than others - but it is imperative that we forget the shame of our youth. Repent, put it behind you, and move on. Even Joseph Smith confessed that during his youth he struggled, as he wrote, with

&lt;i&gt;all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God.&lt;/i&gt; [JS - H 1:28]

Joseph went on to explain that he was never guilty of any great or malignant sins; he was never disposed to commit such, but he did have to repent and put those indiscretions behind him. So did the apostle Paul. He, too, had to dispose of a sinful past. He wrote to the Saints in Macedonia: "&lt;i&gt;Forgetting those things which are behind, . . .&lt;/i&gt; I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God" (Philippians 3:1314; emphasis added).

One sister missionary, while bearing her testimony during the first hours at the MTC, explained that she had experienced a long, hard struggle to prepare herself and be worthy to represent the Lord as a missionary. She didnt go into any detail of her past sins; she just let everyone know that she had gone through an extended period of serious repentance. At one point in her testimony she stopped and smiled and said, "I cant even remember the person I used to be."

When you have fully repented of your sins and are converted to the Lord, you are born again - you become a new person. You dont have to be concerned about your old sins because that old person who committed those sins is buried away. That is not you. You have become a new person who would not commit such sins. Therefore you can forgive yourself, forsake those sins, and forget your past. Its like Sister Ogdens organ playing: whenever she makes a mistake, she has to forget it and move on. She cant dwell on it. There is much more to get right.

Jesus helps you become a new and different person who has learned the divine principles of &lt;i&gt;forgiving&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;forgetting.&lt;/i&gt; The Hebrew word for &lt;i&gt;atonement&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;kippur&lt;/i&gt; (as in Yom Kippur: the day of atonement), and the basic meaning of &lt;i&gt;kippur&lt;/i&gt; is to cover up. The Savior has suffered for, and covered up, the sins of us all - pending our complete repentance.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Good News of Repentance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The scriptures not only teach that there are awful consequences of not repenting but also that there are extraordinary rewards for repenting. The gospel of Jesus Christ is occasionally referred to in the scriptures as "the gospel of repentance" (D&amp;amp;C 13:1; 138:57; JS - H 1:69). The word &lt;i&gt;gospel&lt;/i&gt; means "good news"; therefore it is the good news of repentance. We sometimes look upon repentance as a punishment - as a distasteful, negative thing. It does involve some pain, of course, but genuine repentance is a blessing - a happy, positive thing.

Two questions are often asked:

1. How can I know if I have been forgiven of my sins? King Benjamins answer is that you will have "peace of conscience" (Mosiah 4:3). By that peace and the Spirit you will know.

2. If the Lord says He will forgive and forget, why cant I forget? If I sit down and think about it, why can I still conjure up the lurid details of my past sins? The Lord leaves the memory in your mind as an early warning system; it is protection against going back to the old ways, the old sins. Alma didnt say he could remember his sins no more; he said he could remember his pain no more. He could remember his sins all right, but he was not harrowed up by the memory of those sins because he had repented of them.

When you fully repent you are born again and become a new person (see Mosiah 27:2429), and the cloud of darkness that once overshadowed you is removed (see Helaman 5:11, 41).

Whatever your past has been, your future is spotless, so tie yourself to your potential, not to your past. One of the most beautiful truths of the plan of happiness is that the Lord forgives and forgets (see D&amp;amp;C 58:42). He chooses what He will remember. When you forsake "Babylon," God forgets that you ever lived there.

Unless you have murdered someone (premeditated murder) or committed the sin against the Holy Ghost (as very few have), you can be totally forgiven of all your sins. That is indeed good news. But you must ask! The Lord said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee, &lt;i&gt;according to thy petition&lt;/i&gt;" (D&amp;amp;C 90:1; emphasis added).

One day while working at my desk in BYUs Joseph Smith Building, I had to erase some writing at the top of some student assignments. I reached into a drawer where I keep a box of pencils that each have an eraser at the end. I grabbed one of the erasers and began vigorously erasing, and while I was erasing I admit that the smell brought back some nostalgic feelings. All through the years of growing up, just before elementary school began each year, I remember going out with my mother and buying school supplies: paper, notebooks, pencils, rulers - and erasers. Is that negative thinking or what? We bought erasers. They were a real part of learning. We knew we would make mistakes and needed erasers. So it is in life. We knew we would come to earth to this "education probation" and make mistakes. We need erasers, and, fortunately, our mistakes are not written in ink - just pencil - and can be totally erased.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Complete Cleansing Is Needed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Sister Ogden and I sometimes find ourselves sitting alone at our kitchen table eating a meal, but thats all right since we are both voracious readers. We always have a stack of reading material (newspapers, &lt;i&gt;Ensign, Readers Digest, National Geographic,&lt;/i&gt; or one of her "health nut" publications). One day I was thumbing through a magazine when a certain page caught my attention. Half the page showed a man with a serious look on his face, and superimposed on the picture was a question in big print: ARE YOU CLEANSED? That question aroused my curiosity. I noticed that the page was advertising a whole line of cleanses: adrenal cleanse, blood cleanse, heart cleanse, joint cleanse, kidney cleanse, liver cleanse, and prostate cleanse. Then I noticed something that caught my attention even more. Just below the picture of the man was the sentence "At last, a complete cleanse line from a name I can trust." Now you might suspect how that sentence registered in my mind: Yes, I thought, I certainly do know about a complete cleanse that comes through a Name I can trust.

In Santiago, Chile, there are at least four ambulance companies in that city of more than six million people. One of the companies is called Rescate Total ("Total Rescue"), and every time I saw one of the ambulances driving by, I thought, "No, I know where total rescue comes from. His name is Jesus Christ." And His is the only name under heaven whereby salvation comes, from whom a complete cleanse can come - again, because He is the One who paid the price. He can take away all our transgressions.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Baptism of Repentance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Sometimes we look with envy on the new convert stepping out of the baptismal font; we feel almost jealous of the fact that there goes the cleanest, purest person on earth. We think, "Oh that I could be baptized again and be freed from all my sins." The fact is that we can be freed from all our sins regularly. If we go to sacrament meeting each week, and we go there having thoroughly repented of all our sins and then worthily eat that little piece of bread and drink that little cup of water, we may leave that meeting totally void of sin. We can literally be clean and pure as we walk out of sacrament meeting each week. We experience again and again the baptism of repentance.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;True Repentance Requires More Than a Cleansing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Actually, the whole process of repentance requires more than just a cleansing, and we need to do more than just repair all damage done. Early in 1984, while returning to our home in Jerusalem, I must have been handling our large, heavy suitcases in such a way that something went wrong in my lower back. For several months I found myself in periodic excruciating pain - apparently from some bone fragments sticking in the largest nerve in my body, the sciatic nerve that runs down the spine and into the legs. After three months of experimental treatments in Israeli doctors offices and hospitals, and not being able to function because of the intense pain, my doctor put me on the strongest painkiller he could prescribe without personally accompanying me and sent me on a plane flight across the world to Salt Lake City for a back operation. The surgery was successful. After some weeks of recovery I flew back to the Holy Land to resume what I loved: teaching and guiding the students on field trips throughout the lands of the Bible and, over the years, climbing Mount Sinai a total of eighteen times.

I learned something from that painful ordeal. It is not enough to repair the damage done. I have to continually strengthen my back so it doesnt happen again. So it is with repentance: we must cleanse ourselves of all that is wrong inside, repair the damage that has been done, and continually strengthen ourselves to become more and more resistant to sin and more and more capable of sustaining light and truth from Him who is our strength. It is through daily diligence to prayer and scriptures, along with exact obedience to all other commandments, and serving others and worshiping in the temple that we keep ourselves strong and avoid the sinning.

Each of us will stand before our Father and look into His divine eyes and report on what we have done with this brief moment of time. We will all have photographic memories (and instant recall!), a perfect recollection of all weve done on earth - and that perfect awareness will either send us into deep despair and remorse or fill us with happiness and gratitude. It is up to us. We will all live forever - no exceptions. And we are determining each day exactly where and with whom we will live forever. Whatever has gone wrong in our lives that has tainted or darkened our souls can be erased, cleansed, removed, and purified by the power of sincere repentance. It is a miracle. Any evil words and deeds continue to reverberate through the universe until we pay the price of godly sorrow and total repentance; then they are completely obliterated. They are not there anymore, and we become a new person, full of light.

It makes me happy to talk about the twin miracles of repentance and forgiveness. It makes me happy to talk about the Savior and applying His atoning blood through the miracle of repentance. That way we acquire more and more light - until the day when we can become perfectly holy, as He is.

I testify of, and I rejoice in, these beautiful truths - in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>There is no principle of the gospel more important than repentance. At least that is what the Lord seems to be saying in the scriptures. Several times He instructed His servants to "say nothing but repentance unto this generation" (D&amp;C 6:9; 11:9; see also 19:21). Does He mean that literally? Is every topic of all the missionary lessons supposed to be repentance? Does repentance have to be the subject of every Church classroom discussion? Of course not. Why did He say it that way then?</p>
<p>The Lord was using a figure of speech called hyperbole, which is an intentional exaggeration to emphasize a point. He said it in a hyperbolic way to stress that there is nothing more important in all the gospel than getting people to repent. This one principle is so vital that it towers above all others in primacy and urgency. Driven by faith, repentance is the single most important principle to live in order to make the Saviors Atonement effective and meaningful in our lives.</p>
<p>Repentance is not just feeling guilty for having sinned, nor is it mere "forgetfulness," pushing the sin way back in our mind to conveniently not be reminded of it. It is an attitude change and a behavior change. We repent not only of sins but also <i>of sinning, </i>and we are willing to do whatever is necessary to remove the stain and the pain. We turn to the Savior. He is the only one who can take away our sins because He paid the price for them.</p>
<h2><b>Godly Sorrow and Suffering Are Necessary</b></h2>
<p>In true repentance, godly sorrow and suffering are necessary. According to the scriptures, if you havent suffered, you havent repented. We have all been through the anguish. Sometimes we feel like pounding our head against the wall, wondering how we could be so foolish as to do the sinful things we do. We hurt inside. And it is not just guilt for being caught or feeling the embarrassment for having to confess. It is godly sorrow we are feeling.</p>
<p>Years ago I saw a painting in an old <i>Instructor</i> magazine entitled <i>Turning Toward the Light</i> (by Ray W. Hellberg, center spread between pages 20 and 21 in "Four Faces of Repentance," <i>Instructor,</i> January 1965). It made quite an impression on me. It portrays the stages a person goes through to be totally rid of his or her sins - from the agonizing pain of darkness to the glimmer of hope and recognition that there is a Light we can turn to and then to fully committing to dedicate ourselves to that Light.</p>
<p>Who is it in scripture that comes to your mind that has given us the most detailed, the most graphic portrayal of the pains of a damned soul? You probably think first of Alma the Younger, and we are glad that he was willing to divulge, and actually carve into the record, those intimate and agonizing details of what he went through to be forgiven of his sins (see Mosiah 27:2829 and Alma 36:1217).</p>
<p>He described wading through tribulation, the bitterness, the bonds, the abyss, and the inexpressible horror at the thought of having to stand before God and answer for all he had done. Alma wrote that he was "harrowed up" by the memory of his many sins. What is a harrow? Those involved in cultivating field crops know that it is an implement that is dragged behind an animal (and now behind a tractor) to break up the hard ground for planting. If a harrow were dragged over a live body, it would certainly become an instrument of torture. Alma also wrote that he was racked with torment. What is a rack? An instrument of torture. Alma chose his words intentionally; he was tortured by his sins, just as is the man portrayed in the painting.</p>
<p>Alma later taught his own wayward son, one who was sinning grievously while serving a mission, "Let your sins trouble you" - meaning what? Let your sins bother you to bring you down to severe depression? No. Alma said, "Let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance" (Alma 42:29). Be glad to suffer the godly sorrow now so you wont have to suffer the full effects of your sins later.</p>
<h2><b>Confession Is Necessary</b></h2>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball taught:</p>
<p><i>No one can ever be forgiven of any transgression until there is repentance, and one has not repented until he has bared his soul and admitted his intentions and weaknesses without excuses or rationalizations. He must admit to himself that he has grievously sinned. When he has confessed to himself without the slightest minimizing of the offense, or rationalizing its seriousness, or soft-pedaling its gravity, and admits it is as <strong>big</strong> as it really <strong>is,</strong> then he is ready to begin his repentance.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_love-vs-lust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Love Versus Lust</a>," BYU devotional address, 5 January 1965; emphasis in original]</p>
<p>We have a worry these days. Many in this generation seem to be growing up with the carefree attitude "I can sin now, and I can always repent later. It only takes a few months of waiting and I can go on a mission or I can go to the temple." But Elder Richard G. Scott warned, "The thought of intentionally committing serious sin now and repenting later is perilously wrong. . . . Premeditated sin has greater penalties and is harder to overcome" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/10/making-the-right-choices?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making the Right Choices</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1994, 3839).</p>
<p>We must confess and forsake our sins now and not put off our repentance. Alma warned us not to procrastinate the day of our repentance. As the old rabbis used to say: You cannot repent the day before you die, because you dont know what day you will die.</p>
<p>When we returned to Utah in 2000 after our mission in Chile, we found our oldest daughter dating a young man named McKell, a lively returned missionary who was also involved in theater programs at Brigham Young University. He was a frequent visitor in our home, and we came to like him.</p>
<p>That fall our daughter was awakened one Sunday morning to hear some terrible news. Her friend McKell had been visiting a cousin along the Oregon coast, and the two of them were far out on a pier when a storm came up suddenly and swept them off into the water. His cousin was battered among some rocks and was rushed off to a hospital, where he struggled for his life. McKell was apparently swept away by the undertow, and his body was not recovered. Eight days later, the very day of a memorial service for him, his body washed up onto the shore and could finally have a proper burial.</p>
<p>McKell was a good young man, just twenty-five years old. I dont believe he knew that he would be leaving the earth that day.</p>
<p>Sister Davidson was one of our extraordinary sister missionaries in Chile. When she finished her mission she returned to school at BYU and continued serving in her ward. One Sunday afternoon while crossing the street near her apartment, she was struck by a car and killed. She was on her way to a meeting and found herself on the way to a different meeting. I spoke in a memorial service for her a few days later. I dont believe Sister Davidson knew she would be leaving the earth that day.</p>
<p>The fact is, none of us knows exactly when we will be departing this mortal sphere, so we should be ready always - never procrastinating the day of our repentance but repenting daily and keeping ourselves prepared to meet God.</p>
<p>Dont wait until the pressure situations of mission and marriage arrive to do your repenting. If the announcements and invitations have already been sent out and you have the interview with the bishop and a member of the stake presidency, and then you realize together that you are not ready for the sacred covenant-making in the house of the Lord - then what do you do? It could be pretty embarrassing, couldnt it? The embarrassment doesnt matter; you dont ever want to enter the holy temple if you are not worthy. To take upon yourself the most sacred covenants and make the most binding promises of your whole life when you are not spiritually prepared or worthy to do so would bring upon you serious condemnation.</p>
<p>Before going to the temple, before going to sacrament meeting, even before kneeling to pray, be reconciled to Heavenly Father and to the Savior - and if there is any conflict or friction between you and any other person, get it resolved now.</p>
<h2><b>Forsaking Our Sins Is Necessary</b></h2>
<p>The scriptures teach that forsaking our sins is necessary. The Lord said, "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins - behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;C 58:43). To forsake means to give up, abandon. Indeed, we must abandon all sin as soon as we can - and it might require a lengthy and mighty struggle to rid ourselves of our toughest and most perplexing weaknesses. It is essential, as soon as possible, to expel sin from our lives. That is forsaking.</p>
<p>There is another angle for us to look at regarding the forsaking of sins. When I was first called to work with the missionaries at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, I quickly learned that by far most of the elders and sisters were prepared and worthy to be there. Those who were not soon found that they couldnt learn the lessons and they couldnt learn to love their companion; nothing seemed to go right because they couldnt get the Spirit, and they couldnt get the Spirit because they were not clean. Those few had to return home and repent, and then many of them were able to return to the MTC and make it work.</p>
<p>Although the great majority of the missionaries were prepared and worthy to be there - learning to represent the Lord Jesus Christ - I noticed that even among them there were some who caught themselves agonizing over past sins. They had fully repented, but they still had a bright recollection of their recent (and sometimes distant) sins, and they became depressed as they remembered the gross sins of their past. What hadnt they done? They hadnt forsaken those sins in yet another sense. Part of forsaking is forgiving yourself and putting the sins behind you - burying the old man of sin, as the apostle Paul put it (see Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:1112) - and leaving them buried and not digging them up anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will sincerely desire to repent and secure Heavenly Fathers complete forgiveness, saying to the Savior, "Here, Lord. Here is my whole package of sin. Please take it away."</p>
<p>And He does.</p>
<p>Then we go back and say, "Wait a minute. Give me some of those sins back; I want to suffer a little more for them!"</p>
<p>No. When you have totally repented, you must forsake those sins, forget about them, bury them away, and not bring them up again. Jesus beautifully stated the principle in agricultural terms: "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62). In other words, when you have planted your life in a more spiritual furrow, keep your eyes straight ahead and dont look back to the old sins, the old people, the old places. Someone has suggested that when Satan reminds you of your past, just remind him of his future! Keep your eyes looking ahead and on the Savior.</p>
<p>I really like some words from Isaiah 54:4: "Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth." I am taking those words out of their historical context, but I find the phrase itself profoundly meaningful. We all know that nobody gets through teenage years unscathed. Everyone has problems growing up - some worse than others - but it is imperative that we forget the shame of our youth. Repent, put it behind you, and move on. Even Joseph Smith confessed that during his youth he struggled, as he wrote, with</p>
<p><i>all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God.</i> [JS - H 1:28]</p>
<p>Joseph went on to explain that he was never guilty of any great or malignant sins; he was never disposed to commit such, but he did have to repent and put those indiscretions behind him. So did the apostle Paul. He, too, had to dispose of a sinful past. He wrote to the Saints in Macedonia: "<i>Forgetting those things which are behind, . . .</i> I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God" (Philippians 3:1314; emphasis added).</p>
<p>One sister missionary, while bearing her testimony during the first hours at the MTC, explained that she had experienced a long, hard struggle to prepare herself and be worthy to represent the Lord as a missionary. She didnt go into any detail of her past sins; she just let everyone know that she had gone through an extended period of serious repentance. At one point in her testimony she stopped and smiled and said, "I cant even remember the person I used to be."</p>
<p>When you have fully repented of your sins and are converted to the Lord, you are born again - you become a new person. You dont have to be concerned about your old sins because that old person who committed those sins is buried away. That is not you. You have become a new person who would not commit such sins. Therefore you can forgive yourself, forsake those sins, and forget your past. Its like Sister Ogdens organ playing: whenever she makes a mistake, she has to forget it and move on. She cant dwell on it. There is much more to get right.</p>
<p>Jesus helps you become a new and different person who has learned the divine principles of <i>forgiving</i> and <i>forgetting.</i> The Hebrew word for <i>atonement</i> is <i>kippur</i> (as in Yom Kippur: the day of atonement), and the basic meaning of <i>kippur</i> is to cover up. The Savior has suffered for, and covered up, the sins of us all - pending our complete repentance.</p>
<h2><b>The Good News of Repentance</b></h2>
<p>The scriptures not only teach that there are awful consequences of not repenting but also that there are extraordinary rewards for repenting. The gospel of Jesus Christ is occasionally referred to in the scriptures as "the gospel of repentance" (D&amp;C 13:1; 138:57; JS - H 1:69). The word <i>gospel</i> means "good news"; therefore it is the good news of repentance. We sometimes look upon repentance as a punishment - as a distasteful, negative thing. It does involve some pain, of course, but genuine repentance is a blessing - a happy, positive thing.</p>
<p>Two questions are often asked:</p>
<p>1. How can I know if I have been forgiven of my sins? King Benjamins answer is that you will have "peace of conscience" (Mosiah 4:3). By that peace and the Spirit you will know.</p>
<p>2. If the Lord says He will forgive and forget, why cant I forget? If I sit down and think about it, why can I still conjure up the lurid details of my past sins? The Lord leaves the memory in your mind as an early warning system; it is protection against going back to the old ways, the old sins. Alma didnt say he could remember his sins no more; he said he could remember his pain no more. He could remember his sins all right, but he was not harrowed up by the memory of those sins because he had repented of them.</p>
<p>When you fully repent you are born again and become a new person (see Mosiah 27:2429), and the cloud of darkness that once overshadowed you is removed (see Helaman 5:11, 41).</p>
<p>Whatever your past has been, your future is spotless, so tie yourself to your potential, not to your past. One of the most beautiful truths of the plan of happiness is that the Lord forgives and forgets (see D&amp;C 58:42). He chooses what He will remember. When you forsake "Babylon," God forgets that you ever lived there.</p>
<p>Unless you have murdered someone (premeditated murder) or committed the sin against the Holy Ghost (as very few have), you can be totally forgiven of all your sins. That is indeed good news. But you must ask! The Lord said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee, <i>according to thy petition</i>" (D&amp;C 90:1; emphasis added).</p>
<p>One day while working at my desk in BYUs Joseph Smith Building, I had to erase some writing at the top of some student assignments. I reached into a drawer where I keep a box of pencils that each have an eraser at the end. I grabbed one of the erasers and began vigorously erasing, and while I was erasing I admit that the smell brought back some nostalgic feelings. All through the years of growing up, just before elementary school began each year, I remember going out with my mother and buying school supplies: paper, notebooks, pencils, rulers - and erasers. Is that negative thinking or what? We bought erasers. They were a real part of learning. We knew we would make mistakes and needed erasers. So it is in life. We knew we would come to earth to this "education probation" and make mistakes. We need erasers, and, fortunately, our mistakes are not written in ink - just pencil - and can be totally erased.</p>
<h2><b>A Complete Cleansing Is Needed</b></h2>
<p>Sister Ogden and I sometimes find ourselves sitting alone at our kitchen table eating a meal, but thats all right since we are both voracious readers. We always have a stack of reading material (newspapers, <i>Ensign, Readers Digest, National Geographic,</i> or one of her "health nut" publications). One day I was thumbing through a magazine when a certain page caught my attention. Half the page showed a man with a serious look on his face, and superimposed on the picture was a question in big print: ARE YOU CLEANSED? That question aroused my curiosity. I noticed that the page was advertising a whole line of cleanses: adrenal cleanse, blood cleanse, heart cleanse, joint cleanse, kidney cleanse, liver cleanse, and prostate cleanse. Then I noticed something that caught my attention even more. Just below the picture of the man was the sentence "At last, a complete cleanse line from a name I can trust." Now you might suspect how that sentence registered in my mind: Yes, I thought, I certainly do know about a complete cleanse that comes through a Name I can trust.</p>
<p>In Santiago, Chile, there are at least four ambulance companies in that city of more than six million people. One of the companies is called Rescate Total ("Total Rescue"), and every time I saw one of the ambulances driving by, I thought, "No, I know where total rescue comes from. His name is Jesus Christ." And His is the only name under heaven whereby salvation comes, from whom a complete cleanse can come - again, because He is the One who paid the price. He can take away all our transgressions.</p>
<h2><b>The Baptism of Repentance</b></h2>
<p>Sometimes we look with envy on the new convert stepping out of the baptismal font; we feel almost jealous of the fact that there goes the cleanest, purest person on earth. We think, "Oh that I could be baptized again and be freed from all my sins." The fact is that we can be freed from all our sins regularly. If we go to sacrament meeting each week, and we go there having thoroughly repented of all our sins and then worthily eat that little piece of bread and drink that little cup of water, we may leave that meeting totally void of sin. We can literally be clean and pure as we walk out of sacrament meeting each week. We experience again and again the baptism of repentance.</p>
<h2><b>True Repentance Requires More Than a Cleansing</b></h2>
<p>Actually, the whole process of repentance requires more than just a cleansing, and we need to do more than just repair all damage done. Early in 1984, while returning to our home in Jerusalem, I must have been handling our large, heavy suitcases in such a way that something went wrong in my lower back. For several months I found myself in periodic excruciating pain - apparently from some bone fragments sticking in the largest nerve in my body, the sciatic nerve that runs down the spine and into the legs. After three months of experimental treatments in Israeli doctors offices and hospitals, and not being able to function because of the intense pain, my doctor put me on the strongest painkiller he could prescribe without personally accompanying me and sent me on a plane flight across the world to Salt Lake City for a back operation. The surgery was successful. After some weeks of recovery I flew back to the Holy Land to resume what I loved: teaching and guiding the students on field trips throughout the lands of the Bible and, over the years, climbing Mount Sinai a total of eighteen times.</p>
<p>I learned something from that painful ordeal. It is not enough to repair the damage done. I have to continually strengthen my back so it doesnt happen again. So it is with repentance: we must cleanse ourselves of all that is wrong inside, repair the damage that has been done, and continually strengthen ourselves to become more and more resistant to sin and more and more capable of sustaining light and truth from Him who is our strength. It is through daily diligence to prayer and scriptures, along with exact obedience to all other commandments, and serving others and worshiping in the temple that we keep ourselves strong and avoid the sinning.</p>
<p>Each of us will stand before our Father and look into His divine eyes and report on what we have done with this brief moment of time. We will all have photographic memories (and instant recall!), a perfect recollection of all weve done on earth - and that perfect awareness will either send us into deep despair and remorse or fill us with happiness and gratitude. It is up to us. We will all live forever - no exceptions. And we are determining each day exactly where and with whom we will live forever. Whatever has gone wrong in our lives that has tainted or darkened our souls can be erased, cleansed, removed, and purified by the power of sincere repentance. It is a miracle. Any evil words and deeds continue to reverberate through the universe until we pay the price of godly sorrow and total repentance; then they are completely obliterated. They are not there anymore, and we become a new person, full of light.</p>
<p>It makes me happy to talk about the twin miracles of repentance and forgiveness. It makes me happy to talk about the Savior and applying His atoning blood through the miracle of repentance. That way we acquire more and more light - until the day when we can become perfectly holy, as He is.</p>
<p>I testify of, and I rejoice in, these beautiful truths - in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, brothers and sisters. Thank you for participating in the devotional today. I know it is a busy time of year, with papers, projects, and finals pending. I promise to do my best to reward your time investment with something helpful to you now and throughout your life.
According to a very fun website1 that I found, it was thirty-six years, one month, and ten days ago that, as a freshman student at BYU, I sat where you are sitting today. I listened carefully as President Ezra Taft Benson, then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a talk titled "Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet."2 He shared how we could more faithfully follow the living prophets and better keep the commandments of God.
The Spirit was strong that day, and I was motivated by President Bensons remarks. I thought to myself, "I am going to follow his counsel to be a better follower of the prophets and to be more faithful in keeping the commandments of God. But I can do better than that. From this point on, Im not even going to make any mistakes!"
Now, I know all of you are a lot smarter than I was as a freshman. You can see the impossibility, and perhaps the silliness, of my well-intentioned commitment.
As I was exiting the devotional, I paused to use the restroom. I was concentrating so intently on my new commitment - to not make any mistakes - that I didnt notice the cute little stick figure wearing a triangular dress on the restroom door. It wasnt until I had turned the corner that I realized where I was. There, standing in front of a large mirror, was a young woman brushing her long, black hair. I hadnt even made it out of this very building before I had failed at my new commitment!
Now, as an aside, I am still grateful to this day to that young woman for not calling for security. Can you imagine the look on the security officers faces as I tried to explain that I was concentrating so hard on never making another mistake that had I made a mistake?
In my minds eye I can see and hear the security officers as they would have looked at each other and said, "Yeah, right! Book em, Danno!"
Today I come to you hopefully a little wiser to share some counsel on something I have worked on ever since that day.
The Starfish Story and Our Thoughts
We are told in Proverbs 23:7 that "as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Related to that is this old saying:
Sow a thought, and you reap an act;
Sow an act, and you reap a habit;
Sow a habit, and you reap a character;
Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.3
As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, our destiny is to live eternally with our Savior in the presence of our Heavenly </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">The New Testament writer Luke described1 a fascinating scene from the Saviors life in which Jesus, sitting at meat in the house of Simon the Pharisee, was approached by a woman who was widely known to have been a sinner. Her behavior, as she approached the Savior, revealed that she must have had some previous interaction with Him of a very personal and life-changing nature, for she tearfully knelt and kissed his feet, literally bathing his feet with her humble tears before wiping them dry with her tresses and applying precious ointment "as a [servant] might do to his master."2
Simon, aware of the womans past indiscretions, inwardly reproved Jesus for allowing a sinner to approach Him in such a manner. Discerning this unrighteous judgment on the part of Simon, Christ artfully rebuked him, and then, speaking to the woman, He said something truly wondrous: "Thy sins are forgiven." Indeed, a miracle had occurred! A miracle more powerful and momentous than the changing of water into wine or the healing of a leper - a miracle tantamount to the raising of one from the grave, for verily a precious daughter of our Heavenly Father had, in very fact, been born again and saved from spiritual death.
On hearing this account, one cannot help but ask, as did the Book of Mormon writer Enos when he heard a similar declaration of forgiveness following a long and tearful night of anguished soul-searching and prayerful pleading: "How is it done?"3 Today I would like to speak to you of what Spencer W. Kimball called "the miracle of forgiveness."4
Two weeks ago I was released as bishop after six years of service, having also served as bishop previously in another ward and as a student branch president prior to that. One of the most marvelous things about serving as a bishop or branch president is sitting in private council with individual members of your congregation and discussing their concerns relating to their personal worthiness and their standing before God; for it is during these sacred times that a bishop receives a large measure of the inspiration and understanding that will come to him by virtue of his calling as a judge in Israel. And I can attest that at such times I have been given to understand more fully the role of the Savior and His Atonement in our Heavenly Fathers plan and the truly miraculous nature of forgiveness.
To fully understand this miracle, we must contemplate the grand and glorious plan of salvation authored by our Father in Heaven. Before we came to this earth we lived as spirits5 with our heavenly parents and siblings, including our Elder Brother Jesus Christ. In that premortal realm a grand council6 was called, and we were presented with our Heavenly Fathers plan, which allowed our further progression. We do not know all the details of that council, but from the scriptures and the writings of latter-day prophets</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">A couple of months ago when I was asked to speak at todays devotional, I was instructed to visit the university photographers office to have a picture taken for use in publicizing this event. During the course of the picture taking, one of the student employees asked me what I teach here at the university.
I answered, "Im an accounting professor."
After a short pause she said, "Oh, so its going to be a boring devotional!"
I promised her I wouldnt talk about accounting and that I would do my best not to be boring, and she promised that she would be here - so, I wont name names, but, good sister, I hope youre out there!
When I was a child, my mother would invariably call out to me as I walked out the door, "Douglas, remember who you are!"
I answered, "Okay, Mom," and off I would go.
There were times in my youth when challenges and temptations arose when I made certain choices that were critically important to my personal growth - mainly because I did not want to disappoint my mother. I knew she loved me. I knew she would love me no matter what I did, but I knew what she expected of me. When I did make mistakes, she freely forgave and never withheld her love. Instead, she reminded me of who I am, encouraged me to move forward, and gave me the strength to do better.
But, looking back, I dont think I truly and deeply understood just who it was that I was supposed to remember that I was!
In May of 1984 I was finishing the last full day of my mission to the wonderful people of Uruguay. My shoes were worn, my feet were calloused, and my 100-percent polyester suits had taken on an almost mirror-like shine. Some of you might remember those - we called them our "steel-wool" suits. People had to shield their eyes when missionaries stepped out into the sunlight! I have to say that for my two sons who are offering the prayers today, the suits they took on their missions are much nicer than the missionary suits of thirty years ago. Well, back to the story. My bags were packed and I was in the mission home preparing to catch my flight home the next day.
As I waited for my final interview with my mission president, I was reflecting back on my experiences - the highs, the lows, the joys, and the sorrows. I had worked hard! I had given it my all. But at that moment I was focused on my shortcomings - the things that I wished I had done better. In the middle of my reflecting, President Waldo P. Call invited me into his office. He immediately asked me how I felt about my mission.
I told him that I had worked hard, that I had given it everything I had, but that I wished I could go back - go back in time. I would be so much more effective if I could just do it all over again.
His answer did not comfort me much at the time. He said, "No, you wouldnt." And then he went on to explain: "If you could turn back the clock, you would do things th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">When couples get married, their love is deep, and they joyfully anticipate the prospect of spending the eternities together. They enjoy having endless talks, going for long walks, and spending time together. It is a wonderful feeling being with someone you love so deeply.
Unfortunately, for many couples the bliss of deep love and immensely satisfying companionship that was present when they first got married doesnt last. Long talks become replaced with frequent arguments, and when not spent fighting, their time together is characterized by angry silence.
Many of these couples divorce. Others manage the hostility by emotionally withdrawing from the relationship. The spouses become distant from each other, and they keep their interaction to a minimum. President Spencer W. Kimball described these couples when he said:
There are many people who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end their marriages, but who have permitted their marriage to grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouses who . . . are in the low state of mere joint occupancy of the home. [In Marriage (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 4446; adapted from Kimball, "Marriage and Divorce," BYU devotional address, 7 September 1976]
How do these couples go from ecstatic levels of love and happiness to frequent conflict, bitterness, and, in many cases, eventual divorce?
A number of reasons have been identified by researchers, but lately Ive been thinking that most of these reasons can be boiled down to two fundamental factors: a lack of repentance and a lack of forgiveness.
It is important to note that these principles of repentance and forgiveness apply to all relationships, not just to marriage. They apply to roommates, family members, and colleagues at work. So, no matter what ones marital status is or what the prospects in the near future are, these principles are important to all of us.
In most cases we are married for only a short time before we hurt our spouses feelings. Whether it is intentional, based on selfishness, or just inadvertent mistakes, we all end up doing things that create hurt in our spouse.
The remedy is pretty straightforward. We say, "Im sorry." We feel badly that we hurt our spouse, apologize, learn from the experience, and do our best not to make the same mistake again. We repent, and, assuming that the problem wasnt too major, the issue is over.
Elder Joe J. Christensen said:
To develop a solid marriage, we must be able to admit we are sorry for the mistakes we make. . . . When conflicts in marriage arise, we should be swift to apologize and ask for forgiveness, even though we may not be totally at fault. True love is developed by those who are willing to readily admit personal mistakes and offenses. [One Step a</span>
