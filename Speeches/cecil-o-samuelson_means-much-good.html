  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Graduates, families, members of the faculty, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is a pleasure to be together with you on this special day of celebration. Of course we not only celebrate the signal achievements and accomplishments of this distinguished class, but we also gratefully acknowledge the contributions of so many of you who have assisted, encouraged, and supported these impressive graduates during their stretching years of study.

Today we will grant a total of 2,513 degrees. Most are at the baccalaureate level, but 375 are master’s degrees and 36 are doctorates. As you will note in the commencement program, several have also earned special commendation. We are pleased and impressed with each one being recognized today.

As is frequently the case, the age range of our graduates is almost 50 years. While the graduates are almost evenly split between women and men, 55 percent are now married—and that figure, I’m told, will be increasing significantly in the days ahead. The graduates in this commencement come from 48 states, five U.S. territories, and 55 other countries. We particularly appreciate the families and friends who have traveled great distances to be with and honor the graduates today. Almost a third of the undergraduates and over half of those receiving graduate degrees have attended other institutions of higher education before enrolling at BYU.

A year ago, in August 2006, I mentioned to the commencement audience our pleasure in having the groundbreaking for the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center on the prophet’s 96th birthday. As most of you know, last June 23—exactly one year after the groundbreaking—the beautiful new Hinckley Center was dedicated. Again, President Gordon B. Hinckley attended and participated with his counselors, family, many of the Brethren, and special guests. It was a wonderful event. You will likely hear more today about what this magnificent new structure will mean to BYU and to you as alumni. It is a very welcome addition to an already impressive and functional campus, and I express my thanks to the many of you who contributed to this building. As announced, yours will be the very first group of graduates invited to the Hinckley Center tomorrow for our president’s reception. We look forward to continuing this tradition in this new, remarkable setting.

In mentioning these happy events, I must also pause in remembrance of a dear friend, supporter, and leader, President James E. Faust, who passed away early last Friday morning. The entire Church and many others join us in mourning his death. His contributions to Brigham Young University have been significant and numerous. For more than 12 years he has served as the vice chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees. Along with President Howard W. Hunter and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, he has had a key leadership role in the long process of establishing our BYU Jerusalem Center. To the end he has been our mentor, our supporter, our guide, and our friend. We will miss him terribly. Our condolences, prayers, and appreciation go to Sister Faust and his wonderful family.

We are grateful for our marvelous campus with its spectacular grounds and superior facilities. None, however, would be necessary or even possible without the students, who are the fundamental and primary justification for the existence of BYU. We are always grateful for occasions such as today that remind us of this signal reality.

As we reflect on the importance of our students individually and collectively and acknowledge their efforts, we also must ask ourselves why they make this effort. Few would quibble with the assertion that education is beneficial both to the individual being educated and also to the society in which the individual resides. While we share this general appreciation found almost universally across the higher education spectrum, we also acknowledge that the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ provides additional insights and doctrinal imperatives for all to place great value on learning and to be lifelong learners.

The Lord has said, “The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth” (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). Likewise, He has promised:

&lt;i&gt;Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.&lt;/i&gt; [D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]

Thus while we are delighted that repeated surveys and statistical analyses consistently report that compensation for your life’s work will be increased by your BYU education, we believe that, more important, you have made major steps in the process of preparing for the eternities. In addition to participating in sacred ordinances and keeping our covenants and God’s commandments that spiritual progress requires, we need to learn, understand, and apply all that we can generally. This is why it makes sense for the Church leadership to commit significant resources to the educational enterprise of the Church, of which BYU is such a central part. This is also why so many faithful Saints throughout the world contribute their tithes and offerings to make this remarkable university possible for those blessed to be able to attend here.

As we express thanks to our families, professors, and friends for helping along the way, let us also remember the great debt we owe to those who have made this unique experience possible. At BYU we are able to hone our academic skills while strengthening our faith and our capacities for service to God and to our fellow man. Having taken advantage of the BYU experience, you are now especially well equipped to go out into the world and contribute in wonderful and special ways.

As the Lord promised Hyrum Smith, so He promises you that “if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation” (D&amp;amp;C 11:8). Some of you already have a strong sense about what that “much good” will be. Some of you are still searching. But all of you will be able to see the fruition of this promise if you stay true to your ideals and constantly reflect on the Spirit of the Y, which will continue to be with you and lead you to do justly, walk humbly, and judge righteously (see D&amp;amp;C 11–12).

You have been given so much. Now you have the great opportunity and privilege to give back. Of course we will gladly welcome your financial contributions as you join the group of loyal alumni—now more than one-third of a million—who express appreciation for their highly subsidized education by giving back to the university regularly. But above and beyond the financial treasure we hope you will contribute are the character, integrity, and concern for others that are expected of one with the great distinction of being a graduate of Brigham Young University.

While the reputation and standing of this remarkable institution are measured and evaluated in a number of different ways, ultimately the real value of its contribution is reflected in the graduates that it produces. Thus, with great confidence, we look forward to what you will do in your lives with immense appreciation for the benefit that will accrue to the students who follow you and to the blessings that will come to our sponsoring church and its faithful members by virtue of all the good that you will do.

As you leave and go on to other pursuits, whether in the workplace, in the home, or in further education, please remember to apply the secrets of successful learning throughout your lives “by study and also by faith” (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).

God does live, and this great university is part of His plan and work. Congratulations and best wishes as you go on with our faith and prayers in your behalf. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>Graduates, families, members of the faculty, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is a pleasure to be together with you on this special day of celebration. Of course we not only celebrate the signal achievements and accomplishments of this distinguished class, but we also gratefully acknowledge the contributions of so many of you who have assisted, encouraged, and supported these impressive graduates during their stretching years of study.</p>
<p>Today we will grant a total of 2,513 degrees. Most are at the baccalaureate level, but 375 are master’s degrees and 36 are doctorates. As you will note in the commencement program, several have also earned special commendation. We are pleased and impressed with each one being recognized today.</p>
<p>As is frequently the case, the age range of our graduates is almost 50 years. While the graduates are almost evenly split between women and men, 55 percent are now married—and that figure, I’m told, will be increasing significantly in the days ahead. The graduates in this commencement come from 48 states, five U.S. territories, and 55 other countries. We particularly appreciate the families and friends who have traveled great distances to be with and honor the graduates today. Almost a third of the undergraduates and over half of those receiving graduate degrees have attended other institutions of higher education before enrolling at BYU.</p>
<p>A year ago, in August 2006, I mentioned to the commencement audience our pleasure in having the groundbreaking for the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center on the prophet’s 96th birthday. As most of you know, last June 23—exactly one year after the groundbreaking—the beautiful new Hinckley Center was dedicated. Again, President Gordon B. Hinckley attended and participated with his counselors, family, many of the Brethren, and special guests. It was a wonderful event. You will likely hear more today about what this magnificent new structure will mean to BYU and to you as alumni. It is a very welcome addition to an already impressive and functional campus, and I express my thanks to the many of you who contributed to this building. As announced, yours will be the very first group of graduates invited to the Hinckley Center tomorrow for our president’s reception. We look forward to continuing this tradition in this new, remarkable setting.</p>
<p>In mentioning these happy events, I must also pause in remembrance of a dear friend, supporter, and leader, President James E. Faust, who passed away early last Friday morning. The entire Church and many others join us in mourning his death. His contributions to Brigham Young University have been significant and numerous. For more than 12 years he has served as the vice chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees. Along with President Howard W. Hunter and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, he has had a key leadership role in the long process of establishing our BYU Jerusalem Center. To the end he has been our mentor, our supporter, our guide, and our friend. We will miss him terribly. Our condolences, prayers, and appreciation go to Sister Faust and his wonderful family.</p>
<p>We are grateful for our marvelous campus with its spectacular grounds and superior facilities. None, however, would be necessary or even possible without the students, who are the fundamental and primary justification for the existence of BYU. We are always grateful for occasions such as today that remind us of this signal reality.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the importance of our students individually and collectively and acknowledge their efforts, we also must ask ourselves why they make this effort. Few would quibble with the assertion that education is beneficial both to the individual being educated and also to the society in which the individual resides. While we share this general appreciation found almost universally across the higher education spectrum, we also acknowledge that the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ provides additional insights and doctrinal imperatives for all to place great value on learning and to be lifelong learners.</p>
<p>The Lord has said, “The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth” (D&amp;C 93:36). Likewise, He has promised:</p>
<p><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i></p>
<p><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i> [D&amp;C 130:18–19]</p>
<p>Thus while we are delighted that repeated surveys and statistical analyses consistently report that compensation for your life’s work will be increased by your BYU education, we believe that, more important, you have made major steps in the process of preparing for the eternities. In addition to participating in sacred ordinances and keeping our covenants and God’s commandments that spiritual progress requires, we need to learn, understand, and apply all that we can generally. This is why it makes sense for the Church leadership to commit significant resources to the educational enterprise of the Church, of which BYU is such a central part. This is also why so many faithful Saints throughout the world contribute their tithes and offerings to make this remarkable university possible for those blessed to be able to attend here.</p>
<p>As we express thanks to our families, professors, and friends for helping along the way, let us also remember the great debt we owe to those who have made this unique experience possible. At BYU we are able to hone our academic skills while strengthening our faith and our capacities for service to God and to our fellow man. Having taken advantage of the BYU experience, you are now especially well equipped to go out into the world and contribute in wonderful and special ways.</p>
<p>As the Lord promised Hyrum Smith, so He promises you that “if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation” (D&amp;C 11:8). Some of you already have a strong sense about what that “much good” will be. Some of you are still searching. But all of you will be able to see the fruition of this promise if you stay true to your ideals and constantly reflect on the Spirit of the Y, which will continue to be with you and lead you to do justly, walk humbly, and judge righteously (see D&amp;C 11–12).</p>
<p>You have been given so much. Now you have the great opportunity and privilege to give back. Of course we will gladly welcome your financial contributions as you join the group of loyal alumni—now more than one-third of a million—who express appreciation for their highly subsidized education by giving back to the university regularly. But above and beyond the financial treasure we hope you will contribute are the character, integrity, and concern for others that are expected of one with the great distinction of being a graduate of Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>While the reputation and standing of this remarkable institution are measured and evaluated in a number of different ways, ultimately the real value of its contribution is reflected in the graduates that it produces. Thus, with great confidence, we look forward to what you will do in your lives with immense appreciation for the benefit that will accrue to the students who follow you and to the blessings that will come to our sponsoring church and its faithful members by virtue of all the good that you will do.</p>
<p>As you leave and go on to other pursuits, whether in the workplace, in the home, or in further education, please remember to apply the secrets of successful learning throughout your lives “by study and also by faith” (D&amp;C 88:118).</p>
<p>God does live, and this great university is part of His plan and work. Congratulations and best wishes as you go on with our faith and prayers in your behalf. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.
I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. I attended San Leandro High School in the East Bay Area of California from 1967 to 1970. It was a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.
I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.
My experience at BYU was “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building” (I hope) and a preparation for “(4) lifelong learning and service.”1 And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.
The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.
I looked at her and asked quizzically, “Can we do that?”
She responded quizzically, “You do know this is a Church school, don’t you?”
Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.
During my years of service in Rexburg, I experienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to Karl G. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:
I want you to remember that you ought not to tea</span>

As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.
Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline “Remember when; remember why.” We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.
One of you said:
Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.
Another graduate answered:
I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.
I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.
But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.
Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:
Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.
Another graduate shared the following:
One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor’s degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.
Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:
We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.
Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.
The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.
First Charge: Be Awful
The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1
Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.
Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time.
One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4
The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.
My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.
“Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marvel</span>
