  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="In response to a lawyers question, "Who is my neighbour?" Christ told the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:2937). Im sure you remember the story of the man who was robbed, stripped of his clothing, beaten, and left half dead by the side of the road to Jericho. Both a priest and a Levite saw the man but ignored his need, passing by on the other side of the road. Finally a man from Samaria stopped to help. Now, what was the difference between the three men - the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan? They were all men of good intention and subscribed to a similar moral code. What motivated the Samaritan differently?

The priest had a very important responsibility as a mediator between the people and God. He was, by definition, close to God, whereas the people, because of their sins and infirmities, were distant from God. Perhaps he wished in this case to distance himself from the man, thus not polluting his priestly role. The Levite was probably a temple worker and may have been late for his shift. He wouldnt have had time to stop. We dont know the occupation of the Samaritan. We do know, however, that Samaritans were regarded as inferior and were despised by the Jews. Christ emphasized that the response of the Samaritan was motivated by "compassion" (Luke 10:33). Perhaps that compassion came from the Samaritans own experience of being ignored and mistreated. He must have known something of what that half-dead man by the side of the road was feeling. We call such regard for another persons feelings empathy. I believe empathy was the motivating force behind the Samaritans charitable actions.

Empathy has been a key factor in my own emotional and spiritual growth, as well as my professional success as a social worker. Within the context of empathy, my profession has made me a better Christian, and my spiritual values have made me a better professional. This morning I would like to share a little about my understanding of the importance of empathy and discuss four ways in which we can enhance our ability to feel and convey empathy.

As an introduction to my topic, allow me to share an important childhood memory. I was sitting on a bench with other children waiting for Primary to start. (I must have been about four or five years of age.) Admiring the brand-new shoes I was wearing for the first time that day, I was not bashful about sharing my pleasure with the other children. Helene Jones (I still remember her name) could take only so much bragging. She finally responded, "We dont like new shoes. We like our old shoes." What a shock that was for me. How could anyone not like new shoes? Then it occurred to me that my new shoes looked different through Helenes eyes than they did through mine - a lesson in empathy. I was forced to borrow Helenes lenses and ask myself how I would feel if she were bragging about her new shoes to me.

Harper Lee elaborated on this lesson in the book &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird.&lt;/i&gt; In this story an inexperienced teacher punishes Jean Louise, or Scout, unfairly on the first day of school. That evening, Scouts father, Atticus, explains empathy to her:

&lt;i&gt;If you can learn a simple trick, Scout, youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&lt;/i&gt; [Harper Lee, &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt; (1960; reprint, New York: Warner Books, 1982), 30]

1. &lt;i&gt;Empathy is enhanced by borrowing different lenses through which to view circumstances or events - seeing things from different perspectives.&lt;/i&gt; As a visual aid, I brought along a map of the world. Can you find the United States? There is something familiar about this map, but it doesnt look quite right, does it? Australia is not supposed to be at the top. Lets turn the map around. Does that look more familiar? When my Australian friends first introduced me to an upside-down map of the world, it was an interesting realization for me that the directions north and south and up and down on the map were simply arbitrary decisions made by someone many centuries ago. Maps or pictures look different depending upon your orientation - your perspective.

Now, lets go back to the story of the good Samaritan. Im wondering how that picture of the man by the side of the road looked different to the Samaritan than to the priest and the Levite. The priest and the Levite were probably focused on something else - they hardly noticed the man. But the Samaritan viewed that scene through lenses colored or cleansed by his own painful learning experiences. He saw the pain and was compelled to act.

Because of our unique set of personal experiences, we have been conditioned to look at people from different perspectives. We could all be looking at the same person. Some of us would see the background. Others would see the clothing the person is wearing. And some would notice the facial expression and imagine what the person might be thinking or feeling. I am reminded of Gods admonition to Samuel in the Old Testament: "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).

Empathy is looking on the heart - a deep understanding of the feelings of others. Empathy should not be confused with sympathy, which is sharing the same feeling. In professional counseling we dont want too much sympathy because it takes away our objectivity and our ability to be useful. An example of sympathy that is not useful is a husband who has morning sickness along with his pregnant wife. (I have been told it does happen on occasion.) This husband has a perfect understanding of what his wife is experiencing because he shares the feeling - he is sick, too, but he is in no condition to be useful in helping her while she is sick. Social workers must understand and respond to the breadth and depth of all kinds of feelings while remaining objective and able to help.

As a social work educator I try to be like Atticus Finch. I teach my students that they cannot help a client unless they have a good understanding of how that client feels. So we work in class at developing the skill of empathy. We practice identifying feelings by asking ourselves, "If I were in that situation, how would I feel?" Then we practice conveying that understanding by verbalizing the acknowledgement "You must be feeling mad, sad, glad, angry, etc."

There is nothing quite like the feeling of being completely understood by another person. In fact, feeling understood may be more important to a client than getting specific help in resolving a problem or accomplishing a task.

In supervising my studentsbeginning experiences as professional counselors, I find a common theme. Inexperienced counselors generally focus prematurely on identifying and solving the clients problem - such as failing grades, failing relationships, substance abuse, etc. These student counselors often come to supervision sessions frustrated - wondering why they cant get the client to recognize the problem, accept responsibility, or be motivated to change. As the student and I watch the videotape of the counseling session together, I find myself asking the same question over and over again: "What do you think the client is feeling right now?" As these novice counselors become more sensitized to the feelings of their clients and acquire skills in conveying that understanding with empathetic responses, we usually see progress. We find that the clients - even those with the most profound problems - have remarkable ability and motivation to change and to solve their own problems once they really feel understood.

I need to insert a caveat here: There is much more to professional counseling than simply conveying empathy. However, without empathy, you dont get very far.

Understanding with depth and sensitivity how another person might feel is not easy. You have to be able to relate to experiences in your own life to imagine another persons feelings. For example, I am fascinated by the Lords directive to the Israelites in Exodus 23:9: "Thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." The Lord used the principle of empathy in teaching the children of Israel, even when they were not ready for the higher law introduced later by Christ.

2. &lt;i&gt;Empathy is enhanced by valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others.&lt;/i&gt; We dont have to have the same life events to feel the same feelings, but we do have to have experiences in our lives that teach us about the range of feelings. Our personal experiences that make us feel afraid, excited, frustrated, or angry become our teachers and give us tools to connect to other people.

As a professional counselor I learned that I could use my own personal experiences to not only feel empathy for my clients but also to provide perspective (different lenses through which to view the world) to help my clients see beyond failure, anger, or fear to the possibility of hope and resolution. Let me illustrate by sharing one useful experience.

Many years ago, when I was a little thinner and more physically fit, I completed a 30-day wilderness survival course. During the third week of that extraordinarily rigorous experience, we were left in groups of four or five students (without an instructor) and expected to find our way from one point on a topographical map to another point (a distance of about 50 miles). After two days of trudging through the snow in the tops of the Henry Mountains in southern Utah and getting lost on several occasions as we made our way down into the valley, my companions and I were extremely grateful on the third day to be able to identify our location with certainty. We arrived at a stream in the middle of a beautiful meadow. All we had to do was follow this river to our rendezvous point. It would be impossible for us to get lost again. So we gleefully walked along the riverbank, stopping occasionally to enjoy the scenery. The river was wide, slow, and shallow. When we chose to switch to the other side, it was easy to cross the stream by jumping from rock to rock. There came a time, however, when there was no bank. What started out as a grassy meadow had become something of a canyon. As I kept jumping from rock to rock, I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my boots dry. I hate wet boots!"

The stream was still slow, wide, and shallow, and when there wasnt a rock to jump to, it was a relief to find out that I could walk on flat sandstone with the water only a few inches deep. The water still would not get inside my boots. But after an hour or so of this kind of careful walking, the canyon became narrower, and there was no place to walk without getting my boots wet - inside and out. We were not interested in turning around and finding another route to the rendezvous point. We had spent too much time and energy getting this far, so we bravely continued with water just above our knees. I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my pack dry. It would really be a disaster if all my clothes and my blanket got wet." Fortunately the water was quite clear, and I was able to see where to walk in order to stay in the shallower parts of the river. After an hour or two of this kind of progress, I noticed that the canyon was becoming even narrower, and the inevitable happened - there was no shallow spot. We still were determined to press forward rather than backtrack, even though the bottom half of my pack was now drenched. Then, after another hour or so of carefully making my way in chest-high water, I took a step and felt nothing beneath my feet. My thoughts had evolved from "if only I can keep my boots dry" to "if only I can keep my pack dry" to "if only I can stay alive!" I paddled desperately for about 50 feet or so. And, finally, there was a welcome sight - a break in the canyon wall and a sandy bank. We climbed out of the water and examined our packs. Everything was soaked! We made a fire, and as I sat there drying myself, my clothes, and everything in my pack, I felt only gratitude. I remember reflecting on what a waste of time it had been to worry about getting my boots wet.

Now, having had that experience and other similar experiences, I can respond to a client with empathy. I can say, metaphorically, "I can see that you dont like to get your boots wet" or "Youre worried about getting your pack wet" or "You must be afraid you are about to drown." I know what it feels like to be afraid you are going to drown. But even though I have empathy for my clients feelings, I wont share my clients anxiety because I also have a vision of that client sitting on the bank by a fire (metaphorically speaking) and feeling only gratitude.

I have learned over the years that empathy is important for everyone, not just professional counselors. Empathy is an essential ingredient for all positive interpersonal relationships. If we couldnt at least imagine what it feels like to be in someone elses shoes or skin, we wouldnt be able to connect; we would live our lives in isolation. Empathy is the skill or characteristic that makes it possible for us to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (see Matthew 19:19). It is empathy we demonstrate when we "bear one anothers burdens," "mourn with those that mourn . . . , and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" - as taught by Alma (Mosiah 18:89).

3. &lt;i&gt;Empathy is enhanced and demonstrated by reaching out to others, by focusing on their unique feelings and needs.&lt;/i&gt; For example, lets assume that your roommate shares with you the bad news that he or she received a failing grade in a chemistry exam. You may be tempted to convey empathy by sharing your own experience of failure. You could say, "I know exactly how you feel. I got a bad grade in physics once." Although you mean well, your roommate may not interpret your sharing as empathy - at least not initially - because you are focusing on your experience rather than on the experience and feelings of your roommate.

Some of you may have difficulty feeling empathy for such a roommate because you have always been straight-A students. You dont know what it feels like to receive a failing grade. I suspect, however, that you know what it feels like to experience personal failure. You could say to your roommate, "Yeah, I feel for you. I remember when I got a B in English lit." Needless to say, that comment will also not be interpreted as empathy. Empathy is more than just reaching out to others; it is reaching out by focusing on othersunique feelings and needs. So you might convey empathy to this roommate by remembering the feelings you felt when you got that B or D, and, instead of focusing on your experience, saying something like "You must really feel discouraged." With that simple acknowledgment you have opened the door to a meaningful conversation. At some point in that conversation you will probably share your personal experience of disappointment or failure, but the focus will be on your roommates need rather than on your need to share.

I cannot address the subject of reaching out to others without quoting my favorite social worker, King Benjamin, whose directives are consistent with the parable of the good Samaritan:

&lt;i&gt;Ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain. . . .&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just - &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;But I say unto you . . . , whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent . . . and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For behold, are we not all beggars?&lt;/i&gt; [Mosiah 4:1619]

By imagining ourselves in the shoes or skin of the beggar, we can reach out appropriately - not just to appease our guilt but to do our part, whatever that part may be. Through empathy we will know exactly what that beggar needs. It might be cash or it might simply be a smile or a kind word. It might be a bowl of soup in the nearest restaurant. It might be information about needed resources. And, in a few cases, it will involve ignoring the begging in order to not reinforce inappropriate behavior.

4. &lt;i&gt;Empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of othersfeelings.&lt;/i&gt; Christs ministry gave new meaning to the word &lt;i&gt;empathy.&lt;/i&gt; The empathy we typically try to practice is consistent with the commandment Christ gave at the beginning of His ministry: "Love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 19:19). But at the end of His ministry, after He had provided an example, His new commandment was "Love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34). Christlike love is much more than understanding the feelings of another person. To love as Christ loves requires a perspective that surpasses our mortal ability; that is, we must share the vision and perspective of Christ. Thus empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of othersfeelings that comes only through Christ.

A number of years ago I struggled through a difficult marriage and a painful divorce. My husband had broken his temple covenants and betrayed me. But he would continue as the father of my children, and I didnt want a miserable, adversarial relationship indefinitely. So I made it a matter of prayer. I said something like this: "Heavenly Father, I know you love all your children, so I know you love my husband. Help me to feel about him the same way you feel about him." The result was something of a miracle. The Lord couldnt answer my desperate plea to help my husband change - no amount of faith will take away another persons agency. But the Lord could take away my bitterness and help me feel empathy for my husband - not empathy in the sense that I could relate to his feelings completely, but empathy for him as a son of God. I knew that Christ had all the feelings of a tender parent for my husband, regardless of his behavior. The resulting empathy has made my life much easier.

"Love thy neighbour as thyself" is a commandment, not a suggestion. And Jesusinstruction to "love one another; as I have loved you" is also a commandment. As disciples of Christ we accept this higher mandate. My take-home message today is that we enhance our ability to obey both of these commandments by enhancing our ability to feel and convey empathy. I challenge each of us to increase our empathy by (1) borrowing different lenses for viewing other people, (2) valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others, (3) courageously reaching out to others - focusing on their unique feelings and needs, and (4) praying for the understanding of othersfeelings that comes only through Christ. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>In response to a lawyers question, "Who is my neighbour?" Christ told the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:2937). Im sure you remember the story of the man who was robbed, stripped of his clothing, beaten, and left half dead by the side of the road to Jericho. Both a priest and a Levite saw the man but ignored his need, passing by on the other side of the road. Finally a man from Samaria stopped to help. Now, what was the difference between the three men - the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan? They were all men of good intention and subscribed to a similar moral code. What motivated the Samaritan differently?</p>
<p>The priest had a very important responsibility as a mediator between the people and God. He was, by definition, close to God, whereas the people, because of their sins and infirmities, were distant from God. Perhaps he wished in this case to distance himself from the man, thus not polluting his priestly role. The Levite was probably a temple worker and may have been late for his shift. He wouldnt have had time to stop. We dont know the occupation of the Samaritan. We do know, however, that Samaritans were regarded as inferior and were despised by the Jews. Christ emphasized that the response of the Samaritan was motivated by "compassion" (Luke 10:33). Perhaps that compassion came from the Samaritans own experience of being ignored and mistreated. He must have known something of what that half-dead man by the side of the road was feeling. We call such regard for another persons feelings empathy. I believe empathy was the motivating force behind the Samaritans charitable actions.</p>
<p>Empathy has been a key factor in my own emotional and spiritual growth, as well as my professional success as a social worker. Within the context of empathy, my profession has made me a better Christian, and my spiritual values have made me a better professional. This morning I would like to share a little about my understanding of the importance of empathy and discuss four ways in which we can enhance our ability to feel and convey empathy.</p>
<p>As an introduction to my topic, allow me to share an important childhood memory. I was sitting on a bench with other children waiting for Primary to start. (I must have been about four or five years of age.) Admiring the brand-new shoes I was wearing for the first time that day, I was not bashful about sharing my pleasure with the other children. Helene Jones (I still remember her name) could take only so much bragging. She finally responded, "We dont like new shoes. We like our old shoes." What a shock that was for me. How could anyone not like new shoes? Then it occurred to me that my new shoes looked different through Helenes eyes than they did through mine - a lesson in empathy. I was forced to borrow Helenes lenses and ask myself how I would feel if she were bragging about her new shoes to me.</p>
<p>Harper Lee elaborated on this lesson in the book <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i> In this story an inexperienced teacher punishes Jean Louise, or Scout, unfairly on the first day of school. That evening, Scouts father, Atticus, explains empathy to her:</p>
<p><i>If you can learn a simple trick, Scout, youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.</i> [Harper Lee, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> (1960; reprint, New York: Warner Books, 1982), 30]</p>
<p>1. <i>Empathy is enhanced by borrowing different lenses through which to view circumstances or events - seeing things from different perspectives.</i> As a visual aid, I brought along a map of the world. Can you find the United States? There is something familiar about this map, but it doesnt look quite right, does it? Australia is not supposed to be at the top. Lets turn the map around. Does that look more familiar? When my Australian friends first introduced me to an upside-down map of the world, it was an interesting realization for me that the directions north and south and up and down on the map were simply arbitrary decisions made by someone many centuries ago. Maps or pictures look different depending upon your orientation - your perspective.</p>
<p>Now, lets go back to the story of the good Samaritan. Im wondering how that picture of the man by the side of the road looked different to the Samaritan than to the priest and the Levite. The priest and the Levite were probably focused on something else - they hardly noticed the man. But the Samaritan viewed that scene through lenses colored or cleansed by his own painful learning experiences. He saw the pain and was compelled to act.</p>
<p>Because of our unique set of personal experiences, we have been conditioned to look at people from different perspectives. We could all be looking at the same person. Some of us would see the background. Others would see the clothing the person is wearing. And some would notice the facial expression and imagine what the person might be thinking or feeling. I am reminded of Gods admonition to Samuel in the Old Testament: "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).</p>
<p>Empathy is looking on the heart - a deep understanding of the feelings of others. Empathy should not be confused with sympathy, which is sharing the same feeling. In professional counseling we dont want too much sympathy because it takes away our objectivity and our ability to be useful. An example of sympathy that is not useful is a husband who has morning sickness along with his pregnant wife. (I have been told it does happen on occasion.) This husband has a perfect understanding of what his wife is experiencing because he shares the feeling - he is sick, too, but he is in no condition to be useful in helping her while she is sick. Social workers must understand and respond to the breadth and depth of all kinds of feelings while remaining objective and able to help.</p>
<p>As a social work educator I try to be like Atticus Finch. I teach my students that they cannot help a client unless they have a good understanding of how that client feels. So we work in class at developing the skill of empathy. We practice identifying feelings by asking ourselves, "If I were in that situation, how would I feel?" Then we practice conveying that understanding by verbalizing the acknowledgement "You must be feeling mad, sad, glad, angry, etc."</p>
<p>There is nothing quite like the feeling of being completely understood by another person. In fact, feeling understood may be more important to a client than getting specific help in resolving a problem or accomplishing a task.</p>
<p>In supervising my studentsbeginning experiences as professional counselors, I find a common theme. Inexperienced counselors generally focus prematurely on identifying and solving the clients problem - such as failing grades, failing relationships, substance abuse, etc. These student counselors often come to supervision sessions frustrated - wondering why they cant get the client to recognize the problem, accept responsibility, or be motivated to change. As the student and I watch the videotape of the counseling session together, I find myself asking the same question over and over again: "What do you think the client is feeling right now?" As these novice counselors become more sensitized to the feelings of their clients and acquire skills in conveying that understanding with empathetic responses, we usually see progress. We find that the clients - even those with the most profound problems - have remarkable ability and motivation to change and to solve their own problems once they really feel understood.</p>
<p>I need to insert a caveat here: There is much more to professional counseling than simply conveying empathy. However, without empathy, you dont get very far.</p>
<p>Understanding with depth and sensitivity how another person might feel is not easy. You have to be able to relate to experiences in your own life to imagine another persons feelings. For example, I am fascinated by the Lords directive to the Israelites in Exodus 23:9: "Thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." The Lord used the principle of empathy in teaching the children of Israel, even when they were not ready for the higher law introduced later by Christ.</p>
<p>2. <i>Empathy is enhanced by valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others.</i> We dont have to have the same life events to feel the same feelings, but we do have to have experiences in our lives that teach us about the range of feelings. Our personal experiences that make us feel afraid, excited, frustrated, or angry become our teachers and give us tools to connect to other people.</p>
<p>As a professional counselor I learned that I could use my own personal experiences to not only feel empathy for my clients but also to provide perspective (different lenses through which to view the world) to help my clients see beyond failure, anger, or fear to the possibility of hope and resolution. Let me illustrate by sharing one useful experience.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when I was a little thinner and more physically fit, I completed a 30-day wilderness survival course. During the third week of that extraordinarily rigorous experience, we were left in groups of four or five students (without an instructor) and expected to find our way from one point on a topographical map to another point (a distance of about 50 miles). After two days of trudging through the snow in the tops of the Henry Mountains in southern Utah and getting lost on several occasions as we made our way down into the valley, my companions and I were extremely grateful on the third day to be able to identify our location with certainty. We arrived at a stream in the middle of a beautiful meadow. All we had to do was follow this river to our rendezvous point. It would be impossible for us to get lost again. So we gleefully walked along the riverbank, stopping occasionally to enjoy the scenery. The river was wide, slow, and shallow. When we chose to switch to the other side, it was easy to cross the stream by jumping from rock to rock. There came a time, however, when there was no bank. What started out as a grassy meadow had become something of a canyon. As I kept jumping from rock to rock, I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my boots dry. I hate wet boots!"</p>
<p>The stream was still slow, wide, and shallow, and when there wasnt a rock to jump to, it was a relief to find out that I could walk on flat sandstone with the water only a few inches deep. The water still would not get inside my boots. But after an hour or so of this kind of careful walking, the canyon became narrower, and there was no place to walk without getting my boots wet - inside and out. We were not interested in turning around and finding another route to the rendezvous point. We had spent too much time and energy getting this far, so we bravely continued with water just above our knees. I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my pack dry. It would really be a disaster if all my clothes and my blanket got wet." Fortunately the water was quite clear, and I was able to see where to walk in order to stay in the shallower parts of the river. After an hour or two of this kind of progress, I noticed that the canyon was becoming even narrower, and the inevitable happened - there was no shallow spot. We still were determined to press forward rather than backtrack, even though the bottom half of my pack was now drenched. Then, after another hour or so of carefully making my way in chest-high water, I took a step and felt nothing beneath my feet. My thoughts had evolved from "if only I can keep my boots dry" to "if only I can keep my pack dry" to "if only I can stay alive!" I paddled desperately for about 50 feet or so. And, finally, there was a welcome sight - a break in the canyon wall and a sandy bank. We climbed out of the water and examined our packs. Everything was soaked! We made a fire, and as I sat there drying myself, my clothes, and everything in my pack, I felt only gratitude. I remember reflecting on what a waste of time it had been to worry about getting my boots wet.</p>
<p>Now, having had that experience and other similar experiences, I can respond to a client with empathy. I can say, metaphorically, "I can see that you dont like to get your boots wet" or "Youre worried about getting your pack wet" or "You must be afraid you are about to drown." I know what it feels like to be afraid you are going to drown. But even though I have empathy for my clients feelings, I wont share my clients anxiety because I also have a vision of that client sitting on the bank by a fire (metaphorically speaking) and feeling only gratitude.</p>
<p>I have learned over the years that empathy is important for everyone, not just professional counselors. Empathy is an essential ingredient for all positive interpersonal relationships. If we couldnt at least imagine what it feels like to be in someone elses shoes or skin, we wouldnt be able to connect; we would live our lives in isolation. Empathy is the skill or characteristic that makes it possible for us to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (see Matthew 19:19). It is empathy we demonstrate when we "bear one anothers burdens," "mourn with those that mourn . . . , and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" - as taught by Alma (Mosiah 18:89).</p>
<p>3. <i>Empathy is enhanced and demonstrated by reaching out to others, by focusing on their unique feelings and needs.</i> For example, lets assume that your roommate shares with you the bad news that he or she received a failing grade in a chemistry exam. You may be tempted to convey empathy by sharing your own experience of failure. You could say, "I know exactly how you feel. I got a bad grade in physics once." Although you mean well, your roommate may not interpret your sharing as empathy - at least not initially - because you are focusing on your experience rather than on the experience and feelings of your roommate.</p>
<p>Some of you may have difficulty feeling empathy for such a roommate because you have always been straight-A students. You dont know what it feels like to receive a failing grade. I suspect, however, that you know what it feels like to experience personal failure. You could say to your roommate, "Yeah, I feel for you. I remember when I got a B in English lit." Needless to say, that comment will also not be interpreted as empathy. Empathy is more than just reaching out to others; it is reaching out by focusing on othersunique feelings and needs. So you might convey empathy to this roommate by remembering the feelings you felt when you got that B or D, and, instead of focusing on your experience, saying something like "You must really feel discouraged." With that simple acknowledgment you have opened the door to a meaningful conversation. At some point in that conversation you will probably share your personal experience of disappointment or failure, but the focus will be on your roommates need rather than on your need to share.</p>
<p>I cannot address the subject of reaching out to others without quoting my favorite social worker, King Benjamin, whose directives are consistent with the parable of the good Samaritan:</p>
<p><i>Ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain. . . .</i></p>
<p><i>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just - </i></p>
<p><i>But I say unto you . . . , whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent . . . and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</i></p>
<p><i>For behold, are we not all beggars?</i> [Mosiah 4:1619]</p>
<p>By imagining ourselves in the shoes or skin of the beggar, we can reach out appropriately - not just to appease our guilt but to do our part, whatever that part may be. Through empathy we will know exactly what that beggar needs. It might be cash or it might simply be a smile or a kind word. It might be a bowl of soup in the nearest restaurant. It might be information about needed resources. And, in a few cases, it will involve ignoring the begging in order to not reinforce inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>4. <i>Empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of othersfeelings.</i> Christs ministry gave new meaning to the word <i>empathy.</i> The empathy we typically try to practice is consistent with the commandment Christ gave at the beginning of His ministry: "Love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 19:19). But at the end of His ministry, after He had provided an example, His new commandment was "Love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34). Christlike love is much more than understanding the feelings of another person. To love as Christ loves requires a perspective that surpasses our mortal ability; that is, we must share the vision and perspective of Christ. Thus empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of othersfeelings that comes only through Christ.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I struggled through a difficult marriage and a painful divorce. My husband had broken his temple covenants and betrayed me. But he would continue as the father of my children, and I didnt want a miserable, adversarial relationship indefinitely. So I made it a matter of prayer. I said something like this: "Heavenly Father, I know you love all your children, so I know you love my husband. Help me to feel about him the same way you feel about him." The result was something of a miracle. The Lord couldnt answer my desperate plea to help my husband change - no amount of faith will take away another persons agency. But the Lord could take away my bitterness and help me feel empathy for my husband - not empathy in the sense that I could relate to his feelings completely, but empathy for him as a son of God. I knew that Christ had all the feelings of a tender parent for my husband, regardless of his behavior. The resulting empathy has made my life much easier.</p>
<p>"Love thy neighbour as thyself" is a commandment, not a suggestion. And Jesusinstruction to "love one another; as I have loved you" is also a commandment. As disciples of Christ we accept this higher mandate. My take-home message today is that we enhance our ability to obey both of these commandments by enhancing our ability to feel and convey empathy. I challenge each of us to increase our empathy by (1) borrowing different lenses for viewing other people, (2) valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others, (3) courageously reaching out to others - focusing on their unique feelings and needs, and (4) praying for the understanding of othersfeelings that comes only through Christ. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Good morning, friends. A few months ago I had the opportunity to travel to Italy for the first time. While there I saw art created by the great masters: Michelangelo, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, and many others. In Milan I was able to see the famed The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci. This mural is in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and to see it one must purchase tickets ahead of time and wait for ones fifteen minutes with the painting. When my time drew near, I was corralled with twenty-four others into a waiting area, guided through two air-locked chambers, and finally allowed in front of the painting for fifteen minutes of communion.
As I sat there I contemplated the painting and why it is considered priceless - the value of which is beyond measure. Is it because the painting is old, created in the fifteenth century? Is it because of where it is located - in Milan? Is it because access is limited - few people can see it, so it is more valuable than paintings just anyone can see? Is it because it has been threatened in the past - like when Napoleon used the convent as an armory, a prison, and a stable or when it was partially destroyed by bombs during World War II? Is it because it was painted in an unconventional style - on a dry wall versus in the wet plaster - making it more fragile and rare? Is it because of who painted it - the great master da Vinci? Is it because of its subject?
These questions and others I chewed on while sitting and looking at this painting. Id like to say that I came up with profound answers that shook me to my core, but instead I came up with more questions. How do we measure value? What makes something - and, more important, someone - of worth?
Defining Value
As a professor of literature and culture, it is my job to look at systems of meaning and value, language being the first and foremost. If we go to the Oxford English Dictionary - the fifth standard work for all English majors - excerpts from the entry for the word value (n) read:
 worth or quality as measured by a standard of equivalence
 a standard of estimation or exchange
 [something] worth having
 material or monetary worth of something
 an appraisement
 relative rank or importance
 worth based on esteem
 estimation [based on] real or supposed desirability or utility [later extended] to an individual or group
 opinion of or liking for a person or thing
 worth or worthiness . . . in respect of rank1
According to these definitions, a things value is contingent on ideas of estimation, desirability, likeability, and worthiness. It is at the center of the word evaluate - to analyze - yet often we do not ask the questions, Who determines the system of val</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Brothers and sisters, aloha! Before we get started, I thought I needed to explain my red tie, because when I got up this morning, my 16-year-old son, Freddie, said, "Hey, Dad, why are you wearing that [University of Utah] tie to the devotional?" (Hes an avid BYU Cougar fan.) I pointed out that on the very bottom it says BYUHawaii. So aloha to you.
I express gratitude to the BYU administration for this opportunity to address you this morning. My remarks are dedicated to my mother, who taught me that every human being is a child of God, that He loves all His children, and that we should love them as well, regardless of race or religion. Although my parents and sister are not Latter-day Saints, they have always been a great support to me.
Genesis of the Kalaupapa Experience
In December 2003 I went to Hawaii to do research and invited my wife, JoAnna, to go with me, because I knew we would have a few days at the end of my workweek to also celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. My research focused on the LDS history of Laie, on the island of Oahu, but I asked JoAnna where she would like to go on the Hawaiian Islands for our anniversary celebration. She replied that her priority would be to visit the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement on the north shore of the island of Molokai. We had been reading about this unique place, and I thought her suggestion was perfect. Our trip included a precarious mule ride down the steep 2,000-foot cliffs of the Molokai Range, which eventually spilled us out onto a four-mile peninsula of sacred space, a transforming terra firma known as Kalaupapa.
The literal translation of Kalaupapa may be rendered "flat plain" or "flat leaf."1 In either case, it is surely a leveling experience for all who cross the boundaries of their own professed beliefs and ethnicity into a larger realm of brotherhood and compassion, for it is here that religious denominations and cultural divides dissolve - where the love of God and mankind manifest themselves in a magnificent way. This smooth, beautiful peninsula seems most appropriate to symbolize the universal love of a Supreme Being who embraces all four corners of the earth. Structures erected in this region for more than a century include places of worship for Protestants, Catholics, and Latter-day Saints, as well as a small Buddhist temple. It is a place that not only includes a variety of Christian strains but also extends beyond this realm, embracing an array of other views. In a world made up of thousands of religious varieties, the unconditional love and spirit of acceptance that exist on Kalaupapa truly stand as an example to us all.
After passing through some of the most beautiful landscape our eyes had ever beheld, we met LDS Church member Kuulei Bell at the Kalaupapa post office. At that time Kuulei was employed as the Kalaupapa postal clerk. We had a wonderful visit, and it was then that I determined to wr</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My first memory of staring poverty in the face came about 1936, during the great economic depression. About that same time Maynard Dixon painted a poignant picture called Forgotten Man. This is a man with holes in his shoes, downcast eyes, and hands hanging down. He is without work or hope, sitting on the curb. Well-dressed men and women walk by, paying no more attention to him than to the fire hydrant next to him. The faces of the passersby are deliberately not shown - representing, I think, their lack of humanity and compassion. I hope this captures your full attention and introduces my remarks in a memorable way.
I would have been about five years old when a man dressed in tattered clothing came to our door in Winslow, Arizona, asking: "Could you spare some food or money? I am on the road, cold and hungry." The concern and empathy I felt never left me. During those years poverty was widespread. As I remember, Mother always found something to spare for the poor.
We had few luxuries and guarded our meager resources closely. We always had a comfortable home, however, and good food on the table. Mother canned fruit, vegetables, and meat. She made all of our bread and many of our shirts. I never remember eating at a restaurant. We did not consider ourselves poor. Nearly everyone around us was in similar circumstances. We enjoyed a good life. In reality, measured by standards through most of the worlds history, we were rich. We had clean running water, indoor plumbing, space to live in, and clothing that in most ages would be robes only the rich could afford.
Today many of us enjoy unprecedented abundance. We see it here and nearly everywhere. We can easily forget that a major percentage of the worlds people live in poverty, seriously lacking necessities. What should we do about this gap between those with plenty and those living in poverty? Do we have an individual responsibility to help alleviate poverty? Does the Church, now a worldwide institution, have a responsibility to help? Is caring for the poor merely a good thing to do or an imperative duty? These are the issues I will address.
One of the phrases we often hear in prayers is "Bless the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, and those who have cause to mourn." I hope we always pray for the poor and needy, but isnt there more to this than dashing off that phrase? And why should I even bring up this subject with university students?
Although material abundance may come for many of you, those days are probably in the future. Nevertheless, this is a good time to be thinking about these things. I have sensed a great spirit of compassion here. I felt it when I spoke at the hunger banquet on campus 11 months ago. I am aware that some of you struggle daily. The overall impression, however, is one of ampleness. And if we compare our comfortable circumstances with such places as Bangladesh, Haiti, and Bolivia, we know we are bles</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Differences in People
One of my earliest childhood memories is of my father, who was a blessed peacemaker, settling disputes in our family by using a Samoan saying he had learned on his mission in the South Seas a few years before: "Asi, asi paco", he would say (Im sure my mother and my brother remember it), which he said meant literally, "Ducks are different" or in other words, "Each of us is unique; be tolerant. People are different but thats not necessarily bad." I feel certain that this oft-repeated experience with my father was the beginning of my understanding about differences in people.
A learned truth is like a magnet, pulling related ideas to itself. Our lives become collections of such ideas which solidify into principles we live by. Eventually those earliest ideas become responses. The genuine responses of our lives reflect our souls growth.
Responses to Criticism
Recently I listened to President Gordon B. Hinckley apply the same principle my father had taught, and the magnet in me responded. He said:
We live in a society that feeds on criticism. Faultfinding is the substance of columnists and commentators, and there is too much of this among our own people. It is so easy to find fault, and to resist doing so requires much of discipline . . . .
He went on to say:
The enemy of truth would divide us and cultivate within us attitudes of criticism which, if permitted to prevail, will only deter us in the pursuit of our great, divinely given goal. We can not afford to permit it to happen. ["Five Million Members - a Milestone and Not a Summit," Ensign, May 1982, p. 46]
How should we respond in these ambiguous times as we are faced with such daily criticism and hostility in the world? And, how should we respond to the everyday frictions and failings in our own lives?
I would like to suggest that part of the answer can be found in two phrases in our own Articles of Faith. The title for my remarks today was taken from the eleventh article of faith and is, Im sure, familiar to you:
We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.
"We allow all men the same privilege". We could define that as tolerance or the idea that my father wanted me to understand.
The second phrase inspires me, lifts me, and is related to the first. I wonder how many of you have ever thought of it by itself, tucked away as it is in the lofty thirteenth article of faith:
"We believe . . . in doing good to all men." We could define this as compassion, or the Saviors kind of love. I see "doing good to all men" a step beyond "allowing all men the same privilege." My contention is that tolerance leads to compassion </span>
