  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="This is truly an impressive sight. Generally my words of wisdom are relegated to my wife, my four children, and my thirty-two Twitter followers. This audience is a little larger today. (And my comments may be longer than 140 characters.)

As president of the Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000 members. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.

This sea of blue gowns and the collective accomplishment it represents fills my alumni soul with pride. Looking at the seats above, you can see others who have gathered today to honor your tremendous achievement: friends and family who celebrate with you today as you cross that finish line to graduation.

Four years ago I was thrilled at my own daughters acceptance to this university and circled this date on my calendar as the day I would celebrate &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; graduation. But instead of wearing a cap and gown today, Kaitlin is on an island off the coast of Italy wearing a missionary name tag and practical shoes. (Im proud of that accomplishment too.)

Since that time we have received many of you into our family circle. Friends, roommates, and extended family are here today. I express my personal congratulations to Zoe, Ashley, Erik, Michael, Matt, Elise, and others we have to come know through our associations here at BYU.

I also offer congratulations to Josh Merrell for not only graduating today but also surviving twelve consecutive weeks of teaching Italian to my two missionary daughters in the MTC. Josh, tell Paige hello for me. She leaves for Milan on Tuesday.

Today is a mark of an incredible achievement. Each graduate here today represents a unique story of dedication and perseverance, and we are proud of you. Since my own daughter is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; here today, I would like to give you the advice I expected to give her.

The Apostle Paul likened this life unto a race when he said, "Let us run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1).

So, following that analogy, consider the fact that the finish line you cross today is simultaneously a starting line for the next phase of life. (It brings new meaning to the phrase "line upon line," doesnt it?) As you approach that starting line, my advice is first to &lt;i&gt;get ready!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Ready!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
To &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; what you want, you must first be &lt;i&gt;ready&lt;/i&gt; for what you want.

President Thomas S. Monson stated:

&lt;i&gt;Preparation for lifes opportunities and responsibilities has never been more vital. We live in a changing society. Intense competition is a part of life. . . . Preparation is not a matter of &lt;b&gt;perhaps&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;maybe.&lt;/b&gt; It is a mandate. The old phrase "Ignorance is bliss" is forever gone. Preparation precedes performance.&lt;/i&gt; ["Duty Calls," &lt;i&gt;Ensign,&lt;/i&gt; May 1996, 43; emphasis in original]

I am confident that your education at BYU has prepared you academically, practically, and spiritually to be ready to "run with patience the race that is set before" you and that you will perform well.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Set!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Next, you must &lt;i&gt;get set - &lt;/i&gt;or, in other words, you must be &lt;i&gt;set&lt;/i&gt; in the values you have internalized here. Continue to stand firmly planted and "be not moved" (D&amp;amp;C 87:8) in the high standards of integrity that you have incorporated into your lives here at BYU.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The third step is to &lt;i&gt;go!&lt;/i&gt;

Just as our students consider the world our campus, BYU alumni have truly &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt; forth from this campus in excellence to work and serve in communities locally and all around the globe. Now it is your turn to &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt; and do the same. Remember to take the Spirit of the Y with you and to represent us well.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
My final admonition is to look for opportunities to &lt;i&gt;return.&lt;/i&gt;

Luke 12:48 states: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required."

The race of life often brings you full circle on lifes track, so you will be able to return and bless BYU with your time, talent, and treasure.

As alumni you can offer your time and talent by mentoring and preparing the next generation of BYU students. You can participate in local chapters, attend sporting events, and wear blue on casual Friday. Look to hire fellow BYU graduates and for other opportunities to support the Cougars.

It may not seem like it today, but you will be able to share your treasure too. Seven of the last eight buildings constructed on campus have been substantially funded by generous donors. These donations have come in every size from individual alumni and from members of the Presidents Leadership Council.

The current construction of the new Life Sciences Building reminds us that there will always be a need for BYU to have state-of-the-art resources for its students.

The privilege of giving back is not dependent on how much or how little you may have. So please dont block our number on your caller ID.

Giving is a form of service that always blesses both parties. I testify that as my family and I have served this university, we have been blessed immeasurably.

Thank you for all you have done as students here on campus and all that you will do as alumni of Brigham Young University.

I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

			<p>This is truly an impressive sight. Generally my words of wisdom are relegated to my wife, my four children, and my thirty-two Twitter followers. This audience is a little larger today. (And my comments may be longer than 140 characters.)</p>
<p>As president of the Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000 members. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.</p>
<p>This sea of blue gowns and the collective accomplishment it represents fills my alumni soul with pride. Looking at the seats above, you can see others who have gathered today to honor your tremendous achievement: friends and family who celebrate with you today as you cross that finish line to graduation.</p>
<p>Four years ago I was thrilled at my own daughters acceptance to this university and circled this date on my calendar as the day I would celebrate <i>her</i> graduation. But instead of wearing a cap and gown today, Kaitlin is on an island off the coast of Italy wearing a missionary name tag and practical shoes. (Im proud of that accomplishment too.)</p>
<p>Since that time we have received many of you into our family circle. Friends, roommates, and extended family are here today. I express my personal congratulations to Zoe, Ashley, Erik, Michael, Matt, Elise, and others we have to come know through our associations here at BYU.</p>
<p>I also offer congratulations to Josh Merrell for not only graduating today but also surviving twelve consecutive weeks of teaching Italian to my two missionary daughters in the MTC. Josh, tell Paige hello for me. She leaves for Milan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Today is a mark of an incredible achievement. Each graduate here today represents a unique story of dedication and perseverance, and we are proud of you. Since my own daughter is <i>not</i> here today, I would like to give you the advice I expected to give her.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul likened this life unto a race when he said, "Let us run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1).</p>
<p>So, following that analogy, consider the fact that the finish line you cross today is simultaneously a starting line for the next phase of life. (It brings new meaning to the phrase "line upon line," doesnt it?) As you approach that starting line, my advice is first to <i>get ready!</i></p>
<h2><strong>Get Ready!</strong></h2>
<p>To <i>get</i> what you want, you must first be <i>ready</i> for what you want.</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson stated:</p>
<p><i>Preparation for lifes opportunities and responsibilities has never been more vital. We live in a changing society. Intense competition is a part of life. . . . Preparation is not a matter of <b>perhaps</b> or <b>maybe.</b> It is a mandate. The old phrase "Ignorance is bliss" is forever gone. Preparation precedes performance.</i> ["Duty Calls," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1996, 43; emphasis in original]</p>
<p>I am confident that your education at BYU has prepared you academically, practically, and spiritually to be ready to "run with patience the race that is set before" you and that you will perform well.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Set!</strong></h2>
<p>Next, you must <i>get set - </i>or, in other words, you must be <i>set</i> in the values you have internalized here. Continue to stand firmly planted and "be not moved" (D&amp;C 87:8) in the high standards of integrity that you have incorporated into your lives here at BYU.</p>
<h2><strong>Go!</strong></h2>
<p>The third step is to <i>go!</i></p>
<p>Just as our students consider the world our campus, BYU alumni have truly <i>gone</i> forth from this campus in excellence to work and serve in communities locally and all around the globe. Now it is your turn to <i>go</i> and do the same. Remember to take the Spirit of the Y with you and to represent us well.</p>
<h2><b>And Return</b></h2>
<p>My final admonition is to look for opportunities to <i>return.</i></p>
<p>Luke 12:48 states: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required."</p>
<p>The race of life often brings you full circle on lifes track, so you will be able to return and bless BYU with your time, talent, and treasure.</p>
<p>As alumni you can offer your time and talent by mentoring and preparing the next generation of BYU students. You can participate in local chapters, attend sporting events, and wear blue on casual Friday. Look to hire fellow BYU graduates and for other opportunities to support the Cougars.</p>
<p>It may not seem like it today, but you will be able to share your treasure too. Seven of the last eight buildings constructed on campus have been substantially funded by generous donors. These donations have come in every size from individual alumni and from members of the Presidents Leadership Council.</p>
<p>The current construction of the new Life Sciences Building reminds us that there will always be a need for BYU to have state-of-the-art resources for its students.</p>
<p>The privilege of giving back is not dependent on how much or how little you may have. So please dont block our number on your caller ID.</p>
<p>Giving is a form of service that always blesses both parties. I testify that as my family and I have served this university, we have been blessed immeasurably.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you have done as students here on campus and all that you will do as alumni of Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">My beloved brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you today. I love this university for many reasons - not the least of these is the fact that I attended school here, as did my wife, our five children, and four of five of their spouses. I suppose you could say that I have a personal, financial investment in this university.
I love that so many wonderful, intelligent disciples of the Savior come to this campus to dedicate themselves to the pursuit of truth and to seek temporal and spiritual knowledge.
I have already said that I love this university. What I didnt tell you was that I also carry fond feelings for this building in which we are seated today.
As I was watching students enter the building this morning, it brought back a flood of memories. For a moment it seemed as though time had rolled back, and I could see myself as a student your age, entering this very building.
However, in my case, the reason I most often entered this building was to work the midnight cleanup shift here at the Marriott Activities Center. If you look around, you will see the very places I walked with broom and mop, tidying up after devotionals, basketball games, and special events. So for those of you who might be tempted to litter while you are here, please keep in mind that I will be watching.
This campus is sacred. While I worked and studied here, I also pondered questions that many of you might be asking at this time of your life:
 What should I study?
 What will become of me?
 Does the Lord care which career I choose?
 Will I ever meet someone, fall in love, and get married?
 Will I find happiness and success in life?
I have to tell you that these questions felt all consuming and even frightening at times. I honestly didnt know exactly where my life would go when I was your age. One thing is certain: I never imagined as I was sweeping this great hall that one day I would be at this pulpit speaking to you.
Today I want to address two of the questions you might be asking - things I myself desperately wanted to know when I was your age.
First, if you dedicate your life to Gods service, will He direct your steps and use you for His righteous purposes?
Second, if you choose to follow the Savior and walk in the path of discipleship, will the Lord watch over you, guide you, bless you, and fill you with a spirit of joy and fulfillment?
A Temple in Philadelphia
In the ten years prior to my being called to the Presiding Bishopric, I had the blessing and privilege of helping to identify and acquire sites for temples.
A few years ago President Thomas S. Monson announced that there would be a temple in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, so we went to work researching possible sites where that temple could be built. Two sites ultimately emerged - and it just so happened that they were across the street from each o</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to each of the graduates today. Graduation is properly a time of celebration - a time to rejoice in the success you have all achieved in earning your degree. It is also properly a time to look forward to what lies ahead - that is in part why we call this ceremony a commencement.
Many of you will go immediately into your first post-college full-time job. Others will head to graduate school. Some will dedicate themselves to the full-time pursuit of raising children. Each of these new adventures will likely be challenging, stimulating, and, in a few cases, close to all consuming - in ways that may cause you to lose perspective.
As you begin this next phase of your life, especially the majority of you who will eventually spend most of your waking hours in a career outside the home, I ask you to reflect on the words of Os Guinness, who astutely observed that, in todays society,
work takes up so many of our waking hours that our jobs come to define us and give us our identities. We become what we do.1
The world would often teach us that we are what we do. It does not take long in most social gatherings to realize this. One of the first questions that is asked when meeting a new person in a professional setting is "What do you do?" The answer to that question not only determines the subject and length of the ensuing conversation but also often creates the identity of the respondent from that point on.
Guinness urges us to not fall into the trap of defining ourselves by our jobs but instead to view our jobs - indeed, our entire lives - as a calling and to choose our jobs and how we fulfill them by determining who we are. In his words:
Calling reverses [the worlds] thinking. . . . Instead of, "You are what you do," calling says: "Do what you are."2
I urge you to consider this concept as you move ahead with your lives, because who you are is extraordinary - "beloved . . . son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents" with "a divine nature and destiny."3 And as a result of who you are - and who you can become - you can have a profound impact on those around you, not only in your jobs but also in your communities and, most important, in your homes.
Because you have lived in the unique environment that is Brigham Young University for the past few years, you may overlook the depth of the impact that those who become what the university and the gospel urge them to become can have on others on this campus.
In 2005, Naomi Schaeffer Riley wrote a book about religiously affiliated universities in the United States. The book is entitled God on the Quad. Riley began her book describing a speech given by author Tom Wolfe at a Class Day address at Harvard in which Wolfe described our current time frame as "the era of the fifth</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">What an awesome sight to look over this blue sea of BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the worlds greatest universities. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One privilege that is mine as alumni president is to officially welcome you into our BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer upon each of you a lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 410,000 living alumni. You will have many opportunities over the years to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with this university.
The mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."1 This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesnt end, your quest doesnt end, and our relationship doesnt end. Our mission as alumni is to extend this marvelous BYU experience beyond graduation and build lifelong relationships with our alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you have learned here. We hope that you will treasure these great lessons and stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.
Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Through our alumni campaign - we call it RISE - we have begun collecting the stories of more than 6,700 of our former students. Here is just one of them.
Arizona graduate Duane Oakes initially struggled to find his place at BYU. With only a few friends and no family nearby, he was contemplating returning home when he met a student-government advisor who told him he wasnt going anywhere because she was going to mentor him. As he was helped, he discovered that he had a passion for helping other students and became involved. Through an educational career he has devoted himself to keeping the legacy going of the things he learned at BYU. He stayed involved.
Now Duane serves on the faculty of Mesa Community College and directs the Center for Community and Civic Engagement. He and his wife now lead the Arizona BYU Alumni Chapter in Phoenix. We love his story. We would love to hear your stories, and we invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.
You are now entering another phase of your eternal progression. We hope your experiences at the Y have opened your eyes to future possibilities. Understand that none of us has "arrived." We are all in a process of "becoming." As you know, that process is fraught with trials and tests. But fundamental to this process is our belief in the fact that we can become what our Heavenly Father wants us to be.
Let me share a favorite story: Hope for the Flowers by Trina Paulus. This is a story of how two caterpillars traversed the trials and risks in their lives to become beautiful butterflies. It started with discovering what a butterf</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Thank you, Elder Oaks, for your very important address. My wife, Wendy, had planned to be with us today. Unfortunately, she sprained her ankle and is propped up at home watching these proceedings on TV. She was on the faculty here for thirteen years. We love BYU. She joins me in extending our heartfelt congratulations to all graduates and their families. We are especially grateful for the excellent messages given by three of the leading lights of this dispensation: President Kevin J Worthen, Dr. Donald B. Doty, and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.
President Worthen stands tall in his position as the thirteenth president of the university. He excelled in his chosen field of law and once served as dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and as advancement vice president at BYU. In the Church he serves as an Area Seventy. We trust him. His peers look up to him. His students emulate him.
Dr. Donald B. Doty is regarded across the globe as the premiere teacher of cardiac surgery. His textbooks are used by specialists throughout the world. You will want to read every word of his amazing biographical summary in your commencement program. While excelling in his profession, he has served in the Church as bishop, stake president, regional representative, and Area Seventy. Later we called upon him to direct the medical affairs of the Missionary Department, which he did as a volunteer for nine years. We are most grateful for his and Cheryls building a network of help for our missionaries that will endure for years. We love them and salute them today, particularly Brother Doty as he gets his honorary degree. No one could be more deserving.
Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were called to the Quorum of the Twelve in April 1984. It has been my rare privilege to sit beside him in our quorum meetings for more than thirty-one years. You know of Elder Oaks past service as the eighth president of BYU and as a justice of the supreme court of the state of Utah. Today you heard him talk about your need to take heart. He also asked you to consider what God wants you to be: to be joyful, to be creative, and to develop a love of God that will bring you a fulness of joy.
Now, let me share a thought for you graduates. You are entering a new phase of life. To this point you have been striving to meet expectations imposed upon you by other people. You have passed exams and may have to pass others in order to become certified. You have been jumping over high hurdles established by others. In order to prepare for what you want to do in life, this is good. But with this transition in the pursuit of your formal education, you need to continue to focus on becoming the person the Lord needs you to be. Strive to develop the spiritual attributes of faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence.
These attributes are difficult to measure, but they constitute the substance of what the Lord hopes fo</span>
