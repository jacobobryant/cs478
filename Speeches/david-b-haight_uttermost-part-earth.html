  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="It is a great honor and privilege for me to be here tonight, and I particularly want to welcome President Dallin Oaks, who is a Regional Representative; other Regional Representatives who are here; and other key school and church officials. We are all proud of the achievements and goals of this University, and of the devotion of the leaders of these fourteen stakes and 137 wards. We acknowledge that this assembly tonight is unique; and in this present academic world, to say it is unique is a major understatement. I pray that I might have the spirit of the Lord with me, so that I might say things that would be appropriate for you to hear; but I pray also that you may be able to hear and witness and understand the thoughts I hope will be appropriate for you this Sunday night.

The choir sang “O Divine Redeemer.” You may not have listened carefully to the words; let me repeat a few. “O Divine Redeemer—turn &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; not away—receive me tho’ unworthy. Hear my cry—behold &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; distress—have mercy, Lord, on thy servant. Hear me, crying out for mercy—please, Lord, protect my soul.” I would say to you, is this not pleading to the Lord to overlook some failures, perhaps? Would comparable statements be: “I didn’t quite understand—I’ll do better if I have another chance—my heart wanted to follow you, so please give me another chance”—or perhaps, “Now, I understand, O Lord—hear my cry”? I do not know the author of those words, but he gives us a rather dramatic view of an encounter we must all face—when we are judged and assigned to our appropriately earned kingdom beyond.

We learn from divine statements and truths contained in the scriptures of two great missions of the Master. The first was to atone and ransom mankind from the effects of the fall of Adam, as part of the plan accepted in the Grand Council in Heaven.&lt;i&gt; He is our Redeemer.&lt;/i&gt; And he is also our Savior, for the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world and to bring salvation to all—to “all who believe in his name.” “To save that which was lost”—to save people from their sins—this is his second mission. The Savior taught mankind how to live, how to serve, how to worship; and he taught the principles of the gospel—this gospel which will bring men back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.

A few weeks ago President Kimball spoke to our Regional Representatives, who had assembled from all parts of the world. All of the General Authorities were also in attendance at this very solemn but historic assembly to receive instruction and counsel, “to be built up in faith and testimony” (quoted from President Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar, September 29, 1978), and to reaffirm to these Church leaders our mission: to assist in saving the souls of mankind and to focus on the things that matter most.

In this comprehensive review of the Church’s progress, we could sense again his—that is, the president’s—anxiety and concern for this work. We who are near our prophet sense his restlessness—because time is moving swiftly, and the world population is growing. But the keys of the kingdom and salvation are here and available to all. We—all of us here tonight—are His disciples.

Of the Regional Representatives, President Kimball asked, “What did the Lord mean when he stood atop the Mount of Olives and said to the Twelve, ‘. . . and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto &lt;i&gt;the uttermost part of the earth&lt;/i&gt;’ (Acts 1:8; emphasis added)?” “The uttermost part of the earth”? Everywhere? Our prophet then remarked, “We have hardly scratched the surface.”

It was the Lord himself who directed that the “gospel must be preached unto every creature” (D&amp;amp;C 58:64). It was President Kimball, our living prophet, who has said to you and to me that we must find the way to proclaim the gospel and declare its restoration to all mankind. Does President Kimball mean that you are involved? Of course!

“Why me?” you might ask. “Others can do it—I’m so busy.” May I remind you that when you accepted baptism, you made a covenant: (a) to come into the fold of God; (b) to take upon you the name of Christ; (c) to bear one another’s burdens; (d) to stand as a witness to God at all times, in all places, and in all things, and to serve God and keep his commandments. And if you do these things, the Lord has promised that he will: (a) pour out his spirit upon you, and (b) grant unto you redemption and eternal life (see Mosiah 18:8–10, 13).

Need I ask, after reminding you of your baptismal covenant—are you part of this heaven-inspired and heaven-directed obligation to teach all mankind? Does the Lord or any of His prophets force you to do His will? Of course not! But the promised rewards are almost beyond our conception. Listen carefully to His promise: “All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ” (D&amp;amp;C 121:29).

The apostle Peter, senior apostle and head of the Church after the Savior had left the earth, in a teaching opportunity asked, “What manner of persons ought ye to be . . . ?” (2 Peter 3:11). He counseled—

&lt;i&gt;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; . . . the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.&lt;/i&gt;

[Peter continued:] &lt;i&gt;Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved,&lt;/i&gt; [that is, the elements and materials rearranged or reorganized,] what manner of persons ought ye to be . . .?

[And then he said,] &lt;i&gt;. . . Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Seeing ye know these things . . . , beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;. . . Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Peter 3:10–11, 14, 17–18; emphasis added]

The apostle Peter encouraged and strengthened the saints anciently so they could spread the gospel and save the souls of mankind. Now, in a similar manner, President Kimball, the Lord’s prophet, is sounding the trumpet for us today to do what?—(a) to live lives of perfection; and (b) to acquire all the knowledge possible—communication skills and language ability—so that we can move with greater speed in reaching the millions of people in strange-sounding places with strange-sounding names who have been prepared and will receive the gospel.

What does the Lord expect of you? What is your role in this divine drama? Consider—has the Lord not brought the Church out of obscurity? Are not the temples dotting the landscape? Are not the satellites stationed in the heavens ready to beam the message? Are not needed facilities and technical skills available, new developments in radio and television communication being unfolded?

We have, I suppose, nearly 20,000 people in this audience tonight. Would ten people on the front row please stand? This is about the proportion of Mormons in the world in relation to the total world population, if we have twenty thousand people here tonight. Now would five of you please sit down? May I remind you that the five standing represent the active participating members of the Church. You five must convert the other 19,990 in this building—but I say unto you, you must hurry. In a few years the world population will double to eight billion.

Our prophet reminds us that “the uttermost part of the earth” not only means the millions in America, but all of Central and South America, all of the Far East, all of Europe, all of Africa. (More than one-tenth of the world’s four billion souls live on the African continent.) China, the third largest country, has nearly one billion people—over half speak Mandarin. Will you be prepared to teach them? And as the prophet asks, will you be prepared to take the gospel to India’s three-quarter billion, to Burma, to Saudi Arabia, or to the 41 million Moslems in Turkey? We are promised that when we are ready—properly prepared as people—barriers will gradually be penetrated and political hard lines will soften. Today, Poland is an example of what will take place. We understand that many people are now going to church in Russia.

In a few years, will we not feel as comfortable and be as familiar speaking of cities in Bangladesh, Iraq, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, and the Ukraine as we now are of speaking of Sydney, Tokyo, Geneva, Walla Walla, and Mexico City? President Kimball reminds us that there is no reason why the Lord would open doors or break down iron or bamboo curtains if we are unprepared to enter.

How can we, he says, be satisfied with two hundred thousand converts a year out of a world of four billion who need the gospel? We are often reminded of Sarah, the wife of Abraham, laughing when told that at her age of ninety years she would have a son. How could she bear children? Yet she did have a son as promised by the Lord. Abraham was to become the father of nations. Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is there anything impossible to Him? If He commands His gospel to be taken to “the uttermost part of the earth,” will he not open the way—if the carriers of the message are ready and prepared?

If each of you was asked to outline what qualities messengers—those authorized to carry Christ’s gospel of salvation unto the expanding proselyting world—must have if they were to succeed, your outline would probably include a personal, growing faith in and knowledge of God the Father and Jesus Christ—a knowledge that would be sufficient for one’s salvation and a faith such that His saving principles would have become part of one’s life. In addition, this outline would include good works and a desire to serve mankind as evidenced by positive actions. Did not the Lord teach as fundamental “. . . Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them . . .” (Matthew 7:12)?

Would your outline not also include the love of people? Love, but with the measuring rod He built in—one must love people to the same degree that he loves himself or it really does not matter. One must be considerate of others and, in addition, not steal, not lie, not cheat, not bear false witness, not plan to take another’s life. And then you would include the keeping of God’s commandments—all of them. One cannot just pick and choose. “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15).

When President Kimball indicates an uneasiness about our present pace in converting the world, his concern is not limited to missionaries and baptisms, important though they are, but extends to the development of our teaching and training skills to strengthen and build up the millions of people who will eventually “come unto Christ.” Many of you have been on missions, and you say, “I served my two years.” Did not President Kimball explain &lt;a href=&quot;https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_honor-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #33cccc;&quot;&gt;a few months ago on this campus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that your mission has no time limit, but could last one hundred years, two hundred years, or whatever might be needed? If you see your role clearly, your two-year mission was a prep school preparing you for further involvement, somewhere in the world, in assisting new members to understand and live the Savior’s teachings. You may serve a number of calls as you respond to the needs of an expanding Church reaching out to “the uttermost part of the earth.”

Plan your professional and family goals so that you will have a part in this vision of our prophet. Prepare to reach out and to bless more people—keep your life in harmony. What a blessing to have a living prophet in our midst! You can see him, you can hear his voice, you can read his messages to the world, you can shake his hand and look into his piercing eyes. We sing “Come, listen to a prophet’s voice, and hear the words of God”—do you get that feeling when you talk about him? To us he is so human and gentle and spiritual, and yet so forceful. We understand what he means.

Our civilization is entering into troubling times—times that are fed and nourished by people who scoff at divine truths, who scoff at Bible references or at such terms as “under God” or “in God we trust” or at references made to the framers of the Constitution being wise men raised up for that very purpose (see D&amp;amp;C 101: 80).

The part you will play in the coming years is critical. It is meant that all of you be strong—not weaklings tossed to and fro, but valiant leaders who enter the fray as defenders of truth and right. Troubled times require valiant men and women like you—products of this great University and of these student stakes who, in a spirit of love and hope, will teach the world correct moral principles and high ethical standards. Who else will, if you do not?

Some polls indicate that a congressman from New York State, an admitted contributor to the delinquency of a 16-year-old boy, will likely be reelected to Congress. Moral standards? Who cares? I guess some might think that way. A congressman from Michigan convicted a few days ago of 29 counts of mail fraud and embezzling money will likely be reelected (“How Morality Declines in the U.S. Congress,” &lt;i&gt;Deseret News&lt;/i&gt;, October 31, 1978). Perhaps others will be elected on this coming Tuesday who have demonstrated dishonesty, immorality, and disregard for traditional moral standards. A highly respected political writer wrote:

&lt;i&gt;The critical weakness of our society is that . . . our people do not have great purposes which they are united in wanting to achieve. The public mood of the country is defensive, to hold on and to conserve, not to push forward and to create. We talk about ourselves these days as if we were a completed society, one which has achieved its purposes, and has no further great business to transact.&lt;/i&gt; [John J. Jessup, &lt;i&gt;The National Purpose,&lt;/i&gt; Walter Lippman, quoted on p. 1]

Sometimes we hear people say, “The world has changed—the Church is out of step with modern times. The old religious laws don’t apply any more.” Similar voices were heard by the apostle Paul, who wrote:

&lt;i&gt;In the last days perilous times shall come.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous . . . , blasphemers, disobedient to parents, . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.&lt;/i&gt; [2 Timothy 3:1–4]

Who will be the strong, powerful voice and influence to stem such a tide? &lt;i&gt;It must be you&lt;/i&gt;. You are in training, but you must believe and live Christ’s teachings if you are to fill your hoped-for destiny in this world.

Your outline of qualifications to become one of the messengers for the Savior would include that one must be morally and sexually pure. I recall the testimony of a young lady at a stake conference in which she told of her dating years. Her mother had helped her to understand the pitfalls. Now a young wife living in an army base, she could look at her husband sitting on the stand at church—a member of the Sunday School presidency—and be proud of him, remembering their wonderful courtship and relationship: married in the temple, nothing to hide, no regrets. She told how they were tempted. But their goal was the temple. They knew the difference between a pure kiss and necking. They knew that virtue is lost by degrees. Their plans were carefully thought out, avoiding the parked car on a lonely road and the late hours alone and the steady dating. She wore a single pearl necklace throughout her courtship as a reminder to remain virtuous.

You can avoid the tragedy, the heartbreak, the suffering of sexual impropriety. You control your circumstances. You know the pitfalls—why not use time together constructively in wholesome activities or uplifting discussions? Study together. Do you really know each other? Do you really? Take time to expand your minds. Have gospel discussions. Can you read or speak Russian? Mandarin Chinese? Why not try it? My wife is taking Spanish 101 at the University of Utah now. There is so much to learn.

Can you imagine a greater waste of your parents’ money, saved for your education, than going to filthy movies or buying porno-type magazines? Man’s reproductive ability was divinely created for family development but today is cheapened and degraded to some animal behavior. Never, never permit yourself to compromise God’s instructions. “Thou shalt not,” he said. “. . . Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge,” he has recorded (Hebrews 13:4). “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.” (Psalm 24:3–4).

Have pride in your personal being, your appearance, your clothes, your manners. Learn to say thank you. Learn to speak well, pronouncing correctly and clearly. You need not look like some television character, and I hope you will not, because you are different—you have a divine obligation.

I hope that your personal outline for true messengers of the Lord will include the Savior’s instruction that his disciples be family oriented. Men and women marry—they marry forever—not as an experiment or a trial. They love each other and none other, forever. They raise eternal families and fulfill God’s law to multiply and replenish the earth.

Dr. Elliot Landau wrote recently of a survey taken over fifty years ago of some fifteen hundred children in public schools in California with IQs well over 135—all of a genius caliber. They have been located and interviewed now that fifty years have gone by and they were asked what had given them the most satisfaction in life. The majority of these individuals, now in their late sixties, said that their family had given them the most satisfaction and came first—came before their profession or friends or the making of money.

Is it not interesting how the centuries-old basics of true happiness and fulfillment keep returning—because they are true, solid, never-changing? After a lifetime of study, the world-famous historian and philosopher, Will Durrant, now 92—a man who had never been considered religious—recently wrote, “My final lesson of history after all my study is the same as that of Jesus, ‘Love one another.’”

The Savior time and time again has stressed the commandment to love one another. It is the golden thread woven into His gospel. As the result of a recent revelation to our prophet, all the people of the world must hear Christ’s teachings—&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the people of the world. In this brief period that we have been together hopefully your vision has been broadened as you reflect on your personal obligation.

This University advertises that “The World is Our Campus.” May I also add that the world is yours to convert. Many of the needed new techniques and communications approaches will develop on this campus—but most important will be your heart and your desire. Cultivate Christlike qualities and you will be “anxiously engaged,” as you have been instructed to be, in this great cause. You, my dear young friends, can and will be such an influence for good. The Lord needs your imprint on the world. Someone has written:

&lt;i&gt;Nothing touches the soul but leaves its impress, and thus, little by little, we are fashioned into the image of all we have seen and heard, known and meditated; and if we learn to live with all that is fairest and purest and best, the love of it all will, in the end, become our very life.&lt;/i&gt;

President Harold B. Lee, who so much loved this great University and all that it represents, taught us:

&lt;i&gt;You cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is. You must be sure, if you would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;Conference Report,&lt;/i&gt; April 1973, p. 178]

Now as I leave you with my witness and my testimony and my blessings, I want all of you to know that I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;—that I do not just hope or anticipate, but that sacred experiences have been mine, one only a few weeks ago in the temple—that God lives, that He is real, that He is our Father, that He loves us, and that Jesus Christ is His Son, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. I know this to be true.

I know that President Kimball is a prophet of God. I know that the temple is the house of the Lord. I leave you with my witness and my blessing that your own vision might be broadened, that you too will &lt;i&gt;know,&lt;/i&gt; that someday, somewhere, somehow you will desire to go with others to “the uttermost part of the earth.” May you be so blessed, I pray in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>It is a great honor and privilege for me to be here tonight, and I particularly want to welcome President Dallin Oaks, who is a Regional Representative; other Regional Representatives who are here; and other key school and church officials. We are all proud of the achievements and goals of this University, and of the devotion of the leaders of these fourteen stakes and 137 wards. We acknowledge that this assembly tonight is unique; and in this present academic world, to say it is unique is a major understatement. I pray that I might have the spirit of the Lord with me, so that I might say things that would be appropriate for you to hear; but I pray also that you may be able to hear and witness and understand the thoughts I hope will be appropriate for you this Sunday night.</p>
<p>The choir sang “O Divine Redeemer.” You may not have listened carefully to the words; let me repeat a few. “O Divine Redeemer—turn <i>me</i> not away—receive me tho’ unworthy. Hear my cry—behold <i>my</i> distress—have mercy, Lord, on thy servant. Hear me, crying out for mercy—please, Lord, protect my soul.” I would say to you, is this not pleading to the Lord to overlook some failures, perhaps? Would comparable statements be: “I didn’t quite understand—I’ll do better if I have another chance—my heart wanted to follow you, so please give me another chance”—or perhaps, “Now, I understand, O Lord—hear my cry”? I do not know the author of those words, but he gives us a rather dramatic view of an encounter we must all face—when we are judged and assigned to our appropriately earned kingdom beyond.</p>
<p>We learn from divine statements and truths contained in the scriptures of two great missions of the Master. The first was to atone and ransom mankind from the effects of the fall of Adam, as part of the plan accepted in the Grand Council in Heaven.<i> He is our Redeemer.</i> And he is also our Savior, for the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world and to bring salvation to all—to “all who believe in his name.” “To save that which was lost”—to save people from their sins—this is his second mission. The Savior taught mankind how to live, how to serve, how to worship; and he taught the principles of the gospel—this gospel which will bring men back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago President Kimball spoke to our Regional Representatives, who had assembled from all parts of the world. All of the General Authorities were also in attendance at this very solemn but historic assembly to receive instruction and counsel, “to be built up in faith and testimony” (quoted from President Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar, September 29, 1978), and to reaffirm to these Church leaders our mission: to assist in saving the souls of mankind and to focus on the things that matter most.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive review of the Church’s progress, we could sense again his—that is, the president’s—anxiety and concern for this work. We who are near our prophet sense his restlessness—because time is moving swiftly, and the world population is growing. But the keys of the kingdom and salvation are here and available to all. We—all of us here tonight—are His disciples.</p>
<p>Of the Regional Representatives, President Kimball asked, “What did the Lord mean when he stood atop the Mount of Olives and said to the Twelve, ‘. . . and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto <i>the uttermost part of the earth</i>’ (Acts 1:8; emphasis added)?” “The uttermost part of the earth”? Everywhere? Our prophet then remarked, “We have hardly scratched the surface.”</p>
<p>It was the Lord himself who directed that the “gospel must be preached unto every creature” (D&amp;C 58:64). It was President Kimball, our living prophet, who has said to you and to me that we must find the way to proclaim the gospel and declare its restoration to all mankind. Does President Kimball mean that you are involved? Of course!</p>
<p>“Why me?” you might ask. “Others can do it—I’m so busy.” May I remind you that when you accepted baptism, you made a covenant: (a) to come into the fold of God; (b) to take upon you the name of Christ; (c) to bear one another’s burdens; (d) to stand as a witness to God at all times, in all places, and in all things, and to serve God and keep his commandments. And if you do these things, the Lord has promised that he will: (a) pour out his spirit upon you, and (b) grant unto you redemption and eternal life (see Mosiah 18:8–10, 13).</p>
<p>Need I ask, after reminding you of your baptismal covenant—are you part of this heaven-inspired and heaven-directed obligation to teach all mankind? Does the Lord or any of His prophets force you to do His will? Of course not! But the promised rewards are almost beyond our conception. Listen carefully to His promise: “All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ” (D&amp;C 121:29).</p>
<p>The apostle Peter, senior apostle and head of the Church after the Savior had left the earth, in a teaching opportunity asked, “What manner of persons ought ye to be . . . ?” (2 Peter 3:11). He counseled—</p>
<p><i>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; . . . the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</i></p>
<p>[Peter continued:] <i>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved,</i> [that is, the elements and materials rearranged or reorganized,] what manner of persons ought ye to be . . .?</p>
<p>[And then he said,] <i>. . . Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Seeing ye know these things . . . , beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.</i></p>
<p><i>. . . Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</i> [2 Peter 3:10–11, 14, 17–18; emphasis added]</p>
<p>The apostle Peter encouraged and strengthened the saints anciently so they could spread the gospel and save the souls of mankind. Now, in a similar manner, President Kimball, the Lord’s prophet, is sounding the trumpet for us today to do what?—(a) to live lives of perfection; and (b) to acquire all the knowledge possible—communication skills and language ability—so that we can move with greater speed in reaching the millions of people in strange-sounding places with strange-sounding names who have been prepared and will receive the gospel.</p>
<p>What does the Lord expect of you? What is your role in this divine drama? Consider—has the Lord not brought the Church out of obscurity? Are not the temples dotting the landscape? Are not the satellites stationed in the heavens ready to beam the message? Are not needed facilities and technical skills available, new developments in radio and television communication being unfolded?</p>
<p>We have, I suppose, nearly 20,000 people in this audience tonight. Would ten people on the front row please stand? This is about the proportion of Mormons in the world in relation to the total world population, if we have twenty thousand people here tonight. Now would five of you please sit down? May I remind you that the five standing represent the active participating members of the Church. You five must convert the other 19,990 in this building—but I say unto you, you must hurry. In a few years the world population will double to eight billion.</p>
<p>Our prophet reminds us that “the uttermost part of the earth” not only means the millions in America, but all of Central and South America, all of the Far East, all of Europe, all of Africa. (More than one-tenth of the world’s four billion souls live on the African continent.) China, the third largest country, has nearly one billion people—over half speak Mandarin. Will you be prepared to teach them? And as the prophet asks, will you be prepared to take the gospel to India’s three-quarter billion, to Burma, to Saudi Arabia, or to the 41 million Moslems in Turkey? We are promised that when we are ready—properly prepared as people—barriers will gradually be penetrated and political hard lines will soften. Today, Poland is an example of what will take place. We understand that many people are now going to church in Russia.</p>
<p>In a few years, will we not feel as comfortable and be as familiar speaking of cities in Bangladesh, Iraq, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, and the Ukraine as we now are of speaking of Sydney, Tokyo, Geneva, Walla Walla, and Mexico City? President Kimball reminds us that there is no reason why the Lord would open doors or break down iron or bamboo curtains if we are unprepared to enter.</p>
<p>How can we, he says, be satisfied with two hundred thousand converts a year out of a world of four billion who need the gospel? We are often reminded of Sarah, the wife of Abraham, laughing when told that at her age of ninety years she would have a son. How could she bear children? Yet she did have a son as promised by the Lord. Abraham was to become the father of nations. Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is there anything impossible to Him? If He commands His gospel to be taken to “the uttermost part of the earth,” will he not open the way—if the carriers of the message are ready and prepared?</p>
<p>If each of you was asked to outline what qualities messengers—those authorized to carry Christ’s gospel of salvation unto the expanding proselyting world—must have if they were to succeed, your outline would probably include a personal, growing faith in and knowledge of God the Father and Jesus Christ—a knowledge that would be sufficient for one’s salvation and a faith such that His saving principles would have become part of one’s life. In addition, this outline would include good works and a desire to serve mankind as evidenced by positive actions. Did not the Lord teach as fundamental “. . . Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them . . .” (Matthew 7:12)?</p>
<p>Would your outline not also include the love of people? Love, but with the measuring rod He built in—one must love people to the same degree that he loves himself or it really does not matter. One must be considerate of others and, in addition, not steal, not lie, not cheat, not bear false witness, not plan to take another’s life. And then you would include the keeping of God’s commandments—all of them. One cannot just pick and choose. “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15).</p>
<p>When President Kimball indicates an uneasiness about our present pace in converting the world, his concern is not limited to missionaries and baptisms, important though they are, but extends to the development of our teaching and training skills to strengthen and build up the millions of people who will eventually “come unto Christ.” Many of you have been on missions, and you say, “I served my two years.” Did not President Kimball explain <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_honor-2/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">a few months ago on this campus</span> </a>that your mission has no time limit, but could last one hundred years, two hundred years, or whatever might be needed? If you see your role clearly, your two-year mission was a prep school preparing you for further involvement, somewhere in the world, in assisting new members to understand and live the Savior’s teachings. You may serve a number of calls as you respond to the needs of an expanding Church reaching out to “the uttermost part of the earth.”</p>
<p>Plan your professional and family goals so that you will have a part in this vision of our prophet. Prepare to reach out and to bless more people—keep your life in harmony. What a blessing to have a living prophet in our midst! You can see him, you can hear his voice, you can read his messages to the world, you can shake his hand and look into his piercing eyes. We sing “Come, listen to a prophet’s voice, and hear the words of God”—do you get that feeling when you talk about him? To us he is so human and gentle and spiritual, and yet so forceful. We understand what he means.</p>
<p>Our civilization is entering into troubling times—times that are fed and nourished by people who scoff at divine truths, who scoff at Bible references or at such terms as “under God” or “in God we trust” or at references made to the framers of the Constitution being wise men raised up for that very purpose (see D&amp;C 101: 80).</p>
<p>The part you will play in the coming years is critical. It is meant that all of you be strong—not weaklings tossed to and fro, but valiant leaders who enter the fray as defenders of truth and right. Troubled times require valiant men and women like you—products of this great University and of these student stakes who, in a spirit of love and hope, will teach the world correct moral principles and high ethical standards. Who else will, if you do not?</p>
<p>Some polls indicate that a congressman from New York State, an admitted contributor to the delinquency of a 16-year-old boy, will likely be reelected to Congress. Moral standards? Who cares? I guess some might think that way. A congressman from Michigan convicted a few days ago of 29 counts of mail fraud and embezzling money will likely be reelected (“How Morality Declines in the U.S. Congress,” <i>Deseret News</i>, October 31, 1978). Perhaps others will be elected on this coming Tuesday who have demonstrated dishonesty, immorality, and disregard for traditional moral standards. A highly respected political writer wrote:</p>
<p><i>The critical weakness of our society is that . . . our people do not have great purposes which they are united in wanting to achieve. The public mood of the country is defensive, to hold on and to conserve, not to push forward and to create. We talk about ourselves these days as if we were a completed society, one which has achieved its purposes, and has no further great business to transact.</i> [John J. Jessup, <i>The National Purpose,</i> Walter Lippman, quoted on p. 1]</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear people say, “The world has changed—the Church is out of step with modern times. The old religious laws don’t apply any more.” Similar voices were heard by the apostle Paul, who wrote:</p>
<p><i>In the last days perilous times shall come.</i></p>
<p><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous . . . , blasphemers, disobedient to parents, . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</i> [2 Timothy 3:1–4]</p>
<p>Who will be the strong, powerful voice and influence to stem such a tide? <i>It must be you</i>. You are in training, but you must believe and live Christ’s teachings if you are to fill your hoped-for destiny in this world.</p>
<p>Your outline of qualifications to become one of the messengers for the Savior would include that one must be morally and sexually pure. I recall the testimony of a young lady at a stake conference in which she told of her dating years. Her mother had helped her to understand the pitfalls. Now a young wife living in an army base, she could look at her husband sitting on the stand at church—a member of the Sunday School presidency—and be proud of him, remembering their wonderful courtship and relationship: married in the temple, nothing to hide, no regrets. She told how they were tempted. But their goal was the temple. They knew the difference between a pure kiss and necking. They knew that virtue is lost by degrees. Their plans were carefully thought out, avoiding the parked car on a lonely road and the late hours alone and the steady dating. She wore a single pearl necklace throughout her courtship as a reminder to remain virtuous.</p>
<p>You can avoid the tragedy, the heartbreak, the suffering of sexual impropriety. You control your circumstances. You know the pitfalls—why not use time together constructively in wholesome activities or uplifting discussions? Study together. Do you really know each other? Do you really? Take time to expand your minds. Have gospel discussions. Can you read or speak Russian? Mandarin Chinese? Why not try it? My wife is taking Spanish 101 at the University of Utah now. There is so much to learn.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a greater waste of your parents’ money, saved for your education, than going to filthy movies or buying porno-type magazines? Man’s reproductive ability was divinely created for family development but today is cheapened and degraded to some animal behavior. Never, never permit yourself to compromise God’s instructions. “Thou shalt not,” he said. “. . . Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge,” he has recorded (Hebrews 13:4). “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.” (Psalm 24:3–4).</p>
<p>Have pride in your personal being, your appearance, your clothes, your manners. Learn to say thank you. Learn to speak well, pronouncing correctly and clearly. You need not look like some television character, and I hope you will not, because you are different—you have a divine obligation.</p>
<p>I hope that your personal outline for true messengers of the Lord will include the Savior’s instruction that his disciples be family oriented. Men and women marry—they marry forever—not as an experiment or a trial. They love each other and none other, forever. They raise eternal families and fulfill God’s law to multiply and replenish the earth.</p>
<p>Dr. Elliot Landau wrote recently of a survey taken over fifty years ago of some fifteen hundred children in public schools in California with IQs well over 135—all of a genius caliber. They have been located and interviewed now that fifty years have gone by and they were asked what had given them the most satisfaction in life. The majority of these individuals, now in their late sixties, said that their family had given them the most satisfaction and came first—came before their profession or friends or the making of money.</p>
<p>Is it not interesting how the centuries-old basics of true happiness and fulfillment keep returning—because they are true, solid, never-changing? After a lifetime of study, the world-famous historian and philosopher, Will Durrant, now 92—a man who had never been considered religious—recently wrote, “My final lesson of history after all my study is the same as that of Jesus, ‘Love one another.’”</p>
<p>The Savior time and time again has stressed the commandment to love one another. It is the golden thread woven into His gospel. As the result of a recent revelation to our prophet, all the people of the world must hear Christ’s teachings—<i>all</i> the people of the world. In this brief period that we have been together hopefully your vision has been broadened as you reflect on your personal obligation.</p>
<p>This University advertises that “The World is Our Campus.” May I also add that the world is yours to convert. Many of the needed new techniques and communications approaches will develop on this campus—but most important will be your heart and your desire. Cultivate Christlike qualities and you will be “anxiously engaged,” as you have been instructed to be, in this great cause. You, my dear young friends, can and will be such an influence for good. The Lord needs your imprint on the world. Someone has written:</p>
<p><i>Nothing touches the soul but leaves its impress, and thus, little by little, we are fashioned into the image of all we have seen and heard, known and meditated; and if we learn to live with all that is fairest and purest and best, the love of it all will, in the end, become our very life.</i></p>
<p>President Harold B. Lee, who so much loved this great University and all that it represents, taught us:</p>
<p><i>You cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is. You must be sure, if you would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul.</i> [<i>Conference Report,</i> April 1973, p. 178]</p>
<p>Now as I leave you with my witness and my testimony and my blessings, I want all of you to know that I <i>know</i>—that I do not just hope or anticipate, but that sacred experiences have been mine, one only a few weeks ago in the temple—that God lives, that He is real, that He is our Father, that He loves us, and that Jesus Christ is His Son, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. I know this to be true.</p>
<p>I know that President Kimball is a prophet of God. I know that the temple is the house of the Lord. I leave you with my witness and my blessing that your own vision might be broadened, that you too will <i>know,</i> that someday, somewhere, somehow you will desire to go with others to “the uttermost part of the earth.” May you be so blessed, I pray in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">It is a blessing and an honor to be asked to speak to you today. I never dreamed of having such a great opportunity as this, and I pray that the Spirit will be with both of us. I am just a country kid from Moroni, Utah, so this is extraordinary for me.
As I prayed about what I should talk about today, I had many topics come into my mind. It was hard to decide what would be best for you as well as something I’m passionate about. The letter I received said that I should pick a topic that is important to me.
One of my favorite candies is M&amp;M’s, and one of my favorite interests is missionary work. So, with those in mind, I started to think of the M&amp;M’s of missionary-minded members, for that is what I am involved in as a stake president.
1. Miraculous Conversion
The first M&amp;M that I want to address is miraculous conversion.When I hear that phrase I think of Alma, Ammon, Wilford Woodruff, Paul, and other great missionaries, and then I think, “That’s way above me,” and I turn it off. But this is the start of the sweetness of missionary desires.
I came from a family in Moroni that wasn’t active. I can’t remember sitting in a ­sacrament meeting with my mom and dad. My dad would always pound on the furnace register to make sure I got up for church, but there were long stretches when I can’t remember going to church. My dad was a schoolteacher, so in the summers we’d go fishing or hiking or camping or anything else—just not church. One time, after being gone all summer, I went to church, and Veldon Blackburn, a friend of mine, asked why I had gone inactive. I told him I wasn’t inactive; I just didn’t come to church.
During the summer a few years later I worked hard to be the best and get the best job in Moroni, which was working on the vaccination crew for the Moroni Feed Company. I worked really hard and made the crew. We could go through a flock of ten thousand turkeys in an hour and not lose one. One time we were vaccinating some turkeys up by Fountain Green, and they were just a little bigger than usual. We were taking them out of the brooder coop, vaccinating them, putting them into a truck, and taking them out to the growing pens. We had finished vaccinating about half the flock when I grabbed a turkey, gave it a shot, and threw it up into the truck. As I grabbed another turkey, the last turkey decided it didn’t want to be in the truck, so it came out and hit me in the back of my arm, and I gave myself the next shot in my hand between my thumb and index finger. I will now never get fowl cholera, erysipelas, or Newcastle disease.
I grew a big abscess about the size of a ­tennis ball in the palm of my hand, so I went to the family doctor, Dr. Speakman, in Mount Pleasant. After a few months of lancing the abscess and getting the gunk out of it, the doctor said he would have to take three of my fingers off to save my hand. I’m kind of attached </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As I look at you graduates, tender feelings well up inside me. While it is not possible for me to shake hands with each of you and look you in the eye personally, I want you to know that you are precious in the sight of your Heavenly Father. He loves you. The leaders of the Church love you.
I also want you to know that you have an exciting and meaningful service to the Lord ahead of you. I recognize that years of sacrifice by your parents, as well as by each of you, have helped you become who you are. Today I look at you and recognize your own years of commitment to the Church and to nourishing your own testimonies through study and application of gospel principles. I look at you and see the future of the Church—not just the future bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and auxiliary leaders but the great ranks of future mothers and fathers, Primary and Sunday School teachers, youth leaders, home teachers, visiting teachers, Scout leaders, choir directors, and countless others who will serve the Lord in the 21st century.
It will be a different century than the one that has just passed. In some ways it will be better; in other ways it will be much more difficult for you and for your children. But one thing is inescapable: it will be your century—one in which you have the opportunity to leave your mark for good or otherwise. You will try to influence others, and others will try to influence you. Either you will share and promote your core values, rooted in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, or you will allow others to define your values for you and your posterity.
Communication in the future will continue to change through Internet and new media technologies. Your world of cyberspace—cell phones that capture video downloads, iTunes, social networks like Facebook, text messaging, blogs, Twitter, handhelds, and podcasts—is just the beginning of what is yet ahead for you in the remarkable expansion of technology. It makes me wish I had been born 20 years later so that I could figure out how to run my iPhone when it doesn’t behave, which is quite often.
We are in a titanic struggle, my young brothers and sisters. From the dawn of mankind’s history it has always been so. Good and evil have always been with us, and so has the right to choose between them. For the time I have with you today, I want to share some thoughts about standing firm for the truth.
Recently I saw some research about how other people see members of the Church. I have long been interested in this subject because I have had somewhat to do with missionary work in my Church assignments. Knowing how people see us is an important part of understanding how best to explain ourselves. This particular piece of research made an interesting observation. It suggested that members of our Church can sometimes appear very defensive to those who are not members of the Church. One respondent went so far as to say that when Mormons are</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">I consider it a great privilege and responsibility to be given this opportunity to speak to you. After I received this assignment from the First Presidency, I asked President Samuelson what I should talk about.
He said, “You are the executive director of the Missionary Department. Why don’t you talk about missionary work?”
I have decided to follow his counsel.
You are a magnificent sight! Many of you are recently returned from full-time missions. Many of you will soon be full-time missionaries. I hope all of you are committed to being lifelong missionaries.
Some feel this is a difficult time to do missionary work. A Gallup Poll three weeks ago found 46 percent of Americans view “Mormons” unfavorably, 11 percent don’t know who we are, and 18 percent think of polygamy when our name is mentioned.1
Let’s put this in perspective. In 1842 John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, wrote to Joseph Smith requesting information about the Church. The Church had been organized 12 years earlier and had just over 20,000 members. The Prophet Joseph replied and concluded his response by using the Standard of Truth as a preface to what we know today as the Thirteen Articles of Faith.
As I tour missions, many missionaries memorize the Standard of Truth. It conveys in a concise way what must be accomplished. As I recite it, I invite those of you who know it to say it with me:
No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.2
Who is going to help achieve this? You and your generation!
I believe with all of my heart that we are on the threshold of the most significant missionary success to date. Let me share two accounts of those who have been converted in the recent past.
The conversion of Jordan Vajda, a fine young man who had been a Catholic priest, is instructive. When he was in grade school he had Latter-day Saint friends in his class who shared with him their love of the gospel. At age 13 he found an offer from the Church for a free Book of Mormon. He sent for it, and two sister missionaries responded. They were surprised that he was only 13 and had requested the Book of Mormon. He was impressed with what they taught and what he felt, but after discussions with his family, he decided to become a priest in the Catholic Church. As he prepared to be a priest, he remained interested in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
He studied at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. He became acquainted with many who take the position we are not Christians, </span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">During the observance of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Church members have been reminded of the breadth and depth of his influence as the priesthood leader of this dispensation. Our knowledge has been renewed of the miracles associated with the coming forth and spreading of the gospel, the growth of the Church, and the continuing role of modern-day prophets who lead the Church in latter-day preparation to greet the Savior in a coming day as He ushers in the millennial era. We expect the Prophet Joseph to be with Him when He comes!
How do we prepare to meet the Savior? As we follow the Prophet, every faithful member of the Church must understand and accept a personal commitment to support the work of carrying the message of the restored gospel to the world. The life of each Church member will continue to be directly affected by missionary responsibility. We or our families will have been brought into the Church by missionaries, be now preparing for a mission, have already served at least one mission, or be supporting and sustaining others in fulfilling their calls. Knowledge about how the work is unfolding across the world will strengthen our faith and our desire to fulfill our personal missionary responsibilities.
I pray for the sustaining influence of the Holy Spirit as I offer thoughts about the Prophet Joseph and the coming forth of the Church on the African continent. The dedication of the Accra Ghana Temple in January of 2004 and of the Aba Nigeria Temple one month ago have been acknowledged by President Hinckley as truly miraculous in many ways, and these dedications constitute important parts of the fulfillment of the 1839 prophecy to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail, when he was told, “The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name” (D&amp;C 122:1).1
Africa remains substantially unknown to most of the world. Although it occupies nearly 20 percent of the earth’s surface and its population is almost 15 percent of the world’s total, there are still relatively few who have visited the continent or found reason to inform themselves about it.
For those who have been there, simply hearing the word Africa is exhilarating. It arouses an unending panorama of images and emotions for those who have visited the broad plains, the wondrous natural sights, the small villages, and the teeming cities or who have met any of the vast variety of heartwarming, disarmingly positive, and resourceful African people. A spiritual dimension is evidenced in the lives of so many of them, and they are warmly open and responsive to any sincere expression of friendship. It is primarily the African people who inspire such positive reactions and loyalties from foreign observers, but natural and physical Africa does as well.
Physically, Africa is vast, enormously complicated, and not easily described. It is a huge landmass of deserts, rain forests, boundless plains, wild animal</span>
