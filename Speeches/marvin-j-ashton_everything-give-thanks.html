  <meta class="swiftype" name="body" data-type="text" content="Thank you, President Seamons. Today I hope my message will bring new consideration and meaning to those two important words &lt;i&gt;thank you. &lt;/i&gt;Frankly, over the years I have been troubled by the admonition contained in D&amp;amp;C 98:1: "Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, &lt;i&gt;and in everything give thanks" &lt;/i&gt;(emphasis added).

My inability to give thanks in all things, particularly those events or occasions that have caused disappointment, delay, and misunderstanding, has given me concern. My capacity to express thanks in everything has been quite inadequate. Without "the passing of time factor" I would have failed miserably.

Appreciation for all people and events that come into our lives is most important because it is Gods way of helping us to grow. The ultimate maturity is being able to feel and express appreciation promptly, being fully aware of the value and importance, and showing gratitude for it. How does God feel about giving thanks? In the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21).

Would you like to have Gods wrath raised against you? Would you like to have God angry with you? It can happen, and it will happen if we fail to show gratitude. Why does the lack of appreciation offend God and kindle his wrath? Not because he needs necessarily to see and hear our thanks, but because he knows an absence of appreciation on the part of anyone causes personal stagnation. Our growth and our progress are delayed when we fail to feel and express a sincere thank-you.

May we think for a few moments about occasions and situations where we actually say, "Thank thee, God, for the people and events that have come into our lives that have made it possible for us to develop and grow and mature, yes, for all people, for all conditions, and for all circumstances that allow us to give thanks to human beings and situations for what they can do and will mean to us."

How do you measure up in giving thanks in everything? Let me lead your minds into a few areas where hesitation or delay may leave you quiet instead of expressing present-time gratitude.

How well do you do in giving thanks for yet unanswered prayers? Are you able to give thanks to God when there is delay or silence in matters that are of great concern to you? We would remind you as you ponder and yearn for quick responses to important needs that sometimes the right answer could be no answer.

Are you able to give thanks for dress codes and conduct standards that seem to be restrictive and unnecessary for your personal needs?

It takes a certain amount of courage and maturity to thank in your heart and in words those who would teach modesty and good grooming by lofty standards and personal respect. Are you able to say "thank you" for enrollment in an institution of higher education, even BYU, and for administrators and instructors who expect you to better manage self-discipline and long-range priorities?

Can you bring yourself to give thanks for campus guidelines that seem to be just a little much? Are you wise enough to give thanks when you are inconvenienced by regulations that appear to take away freedom of choice? Are you able to give thanks for a campus honor system that is unique and demanding? Sorry but true, some of us would rather murmur than measure up. You are special students and friends who can and will, I hope, someday be able to give thanks for guidelines that on some occasions may seem unimportant and unnecessary, yet are self-discipline builders.

Are you able to accept a responsibility, particularly one that seems beyond your grasp and comprehension, with a simple "Thank you, Heavenly Father" for an unplanned calling? When I think of my being named a member of the Council of Twelve, I never remember over the years ever saying, "Thank you, Father in Heaven, for this calling." Many, many are the times I have thanked him for his trust, strength, and guidance, but never for the calling. Perhaps someday I will be mature enough to so declare. In the meantime, as I grow older and, I hope, wiser, the thank-you will continue to be for ongoing support.

Can you give thanks when physical limitations are constant and trying? I am thinking of a close friend of mine who died recently. He spent the majority of his life in a wheelchair. Shortly before he passed away, we had an intimate conversation. He said, among other things, "Looking back now, I am glad for the pluses of wheelchair life. It brought special experiences, people, opportunities, and tender relationships I would have never experienced if my mobility had not been restricted."

Can you give thanks when you are trying to climb an extra high mountain in your life of hills and valleys? Oftentimes we pray for strength to make it to the summit in lifes journeys, and the Lord seemingly adds elephant-sized burdens to our backs to carry up steep and trying paths.

Can you give thanks in grief? Can you express appreciation to God for sustaining power when certain pain and anguish seem to be beyond your power to cope?

Can you give thanks when appropriate discipline comes into your life? Many of us have a tendency to complain rather than conform to needed repentance procedures. Can you give thanks when a decision or ruling against you seems unfair and unreasonable? Some of us give thanks in victories, but never in defeat or undeserved delays.

Can you give thanks sincerely each time you give a blessing on your daily food?

Recently I had an urgent challenging assignment. It was not family, neighbor, or church related. It was a new experience. I felt ill-prepared. After a crash preparation procedure and humble prayer, we somehow successfully completed the taxing task. Upon returning to my office, I knelt down and was impressed to utter only two words, "Thank you."

Can you thank God on a continuing basis for people who share challenges, love, and lift?

Let us take the time for thank-yous while we may be heard and others are able to hear.

I have in my possession two letters, among others, that are years old. They are cherished thank-you notes, simple but enduring. One is from Frank Riggs, Jr., of Montgomery, Alabama. His came following a multistake conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Frank is a returned missionary from Denmark. He came home early when multiple sclerosis struck his healthy body.

&lt;i&gt;Dear Elder Ashton:&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thank you for the thoughts and spirit you shared at our multistake conference this past weekend in Atlanta. It was a fairly strenuous experience for me with my limitations, but well worth the effort. Maintaining a level of involvement in service-related activity is very important to me - I am perniciously vulnerable, as one might guess, and determined to avoid the quagmire of self-concern, and your closing remarks yesterday gave me a fresh awareness of my possibilities in this area.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thank you for reading my letter. It was no great chore to write it, though the job had to be done somewhat piecemeal. Sorry about the misstrikes, but, as we say, "Thems the breaks." And I tried to do my best.&lt;/i&gt;

Bedridden and with little or no use of his arms and legs, he put the correspondence together with his typewriter and a pen. He typed his letter to me with the movement of his head moving the pen in his mouth.

The other letter came to me from an FBI agent in New York. He said, "I am here involved in a very, very important case. The days are long and the nights are longer because I am away from my family. I have had a little bit of time to think. As I have been thinking, I am impressed to write you a letter."

In the letter he didnt say, "I am thankful you are a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles." He said, "I want to thank you for what you did for me when I was a deacon, teaching me to be true to myself, my family, and my Church. I will never forget your interest in me. You taught me to try and be a one hundred percenter. Thank you."

As we visit with missionaries, we often ask them to stand up and tell us where they are from, bear their testimonies, and tell us about their companions and their parents. This is a great experience in learning about them and what their thought processes are and what their senses of values are.

I recall one missionary standing up and saying, "I have been in the mission field nine months, and I have had five companions." With a quivering chin and a choked-up voice, he said, "Never once in nine months have I had a companion who told me he loved me or thanked me for what I was doing for him. I hope and pray that someday, somehow, Ill have a companion who will tell me that he loves me and openly expresses gratitude."

No matter where we come from, no matter what our family conditions are, we should learn and be appreciative of those circumstances that can build and lift us.

I recall another missionary who said, "Two weeks before I was to go see my bishop and get the missionary forms and papers processed, I had some doubts. I had some questions about the future and even about the Church. I walked into the living room and interrupted my father, who was watching television, and said, Dad, Im not so sure about this Joseph Smith business. Im not so sure I know the Church is true. Im not so sure I want to go out and represent it. I have a lot of questions, and I have a lot of misgivings.

"When I said that, my father walked over and turned off the television, took the cigarette he had in his hand and smashed it in the ashtray, took the can of beer he had in his other hand and put it down on the table, and said, Son, I want you to know that I dont do very much about it, but I know that the Church of Jesus Christ is true and that Joseph Smith is a prophet. I want you to hear me say it because I know that better than most anything else in this world."

This young man then said, "I want my father to know that I appreciate him. He has some habits that hes not proud of. He has some habits that Im not proud of. But he is my father, and he has a testimony. Im pleased I even told him on that occasion Thank you for being my dad."

That kind of appreciation, that kind of maturity, will not only help a missionary to grow and develop, but will also be a great anchor in lifes paths. A sincere thank-you will cause most of us to share and perform more worthily in the days that follow.

The most common question missionaries ask me is, "Elder Ashton, what can I do to get my mother or father or brother or sister more active in the Church? I realize now what they are missing and what they need. What can I do to get them active in the Church? What can I do to get them to become members of the Church?"

In every case and every situation I have taken the opportunity to say, "The best way to get your family members active in the Church or to become members is to tell them thank you for all they do to support you and tell them how much you love them." We need to express appreciation on a continuing basis, to love family members and neighbors into the Church.

John Powell shares this touching experience:

&lt;i&gt;It was the day my father died. . . . In the small hospital room, I was supporting him in my arms, when . . . my father slumped back, and I lowered his head gently onto the pillow. I . . . told my mother . . . :&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;"Its all over, Mom. Dad is dead."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;She startled me. I will never know why these were her first words to me after his death. My mother said: "Oh, he was so proud of you. He loved you so much."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Somehow I knew . . . that these words were saying something very important to me. They were like a sudden shaft of light, like a startling thought I had never before absorbed. Yet there was a definite edge of pain, as though I were going to know my father better in death than I had ever known him in life.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Later, while a doctor was verifying death, I was leaning against the wall in the far corner of the room, crying softly. A nurse came over to me and put a comforting arm around me. I couldnt talk through my tears. I wanted to tell her: "Im not crying because my father is dead. Im crying because my father never told me that he loved me. Of course, I was expected to know these things. I was expected to know the great part I played in his life and the great part I occupied in his heart, but he never told me." Never once a thank-you.&lt;/i&gt;

In all that he has done, the Savior has indicated the importance of thanks. Here are a few short quotations from the scriptures that should be helpful as we give new thought to the importance of vocalizing appreciation.

"He took the cup, and gave thanks" (Matthew 26:27).

"He took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks" (Matthew 15:36).

"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 59:7).

"Ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with" (D&amp;amp;C 46:32).

"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, . . . and be ye thankful" (Colossians 3:15).

"Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks" (D&amp;amp;C 98:1).

"When thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God" (Alma 37:37).

What a great day it will be in our lives when we can know the blessings of spontaneous gratitude and what it means to us!

Appreciation of companion, appreciation of sweetheart, appreciation of husband and wife, education, and lofty standards is so important. It is a most important ingredient in a happy marriage. Many a family, many a marriage is broken because of a lack of appreciation. The most mature and successful people who participate in marriage are those who understand that a sincere and frequent thank-you is love in one of its most powerful displays. What a strength it is to have a companion who feels and expresses appreciation! Too many times I have heard people say, "My marriage was terminated primarily because my husband (or wife) didnt appreciate anything I ever did for him. No matter what I did, there was no thanks!"

Gods love for us was so great that it was possible for him to endure and look upon the sufferings of his Only Begotten Son. We should be eternally grateful that God gave to us his Son, our Savior and Redeemer. Without him and his love and sacrifice, we could never be glorified in his eternal presence. The greatest gift of all, and the one for which we should be most appreciative, is the gift of his Son to us for purposes and realizations that we little comprehend today but should better understand with each passing hour.

How do we show thanks for Gods great gifts? How do we show appreciation for the gifts of parents, brothers, sisters, companions, friends, and associates? By a sincere and appropriate thank-you. By our lives, by our works, and by constant words of thanks and a willingness to acknowledge blessings and favors from him and others.

Years ago, when the Olympics were held in Melbourne, Australia, in the spotlight on the winners platform one day there stood a beautiful, tall, blonde American girl. She was being presented a gold medal, symbolic of first place in worldwide competition. Tears ran down her cheeks as she accepted the recognition. Many thought she was touched by the victory ceremony; the thing they did not know was the story of her determination, self-discipline, and daily action.

At the age of five she had polio. When the disease left her body, she couldnt use her arms or legs. Her parents took her daily to a swimming pool where they hoped the water would help hold her arms up as she tried to use them again. When she could lift her arms out of the water with her own power, she cried for joy. Next she lifted her legs out of the water. Then her goal was to swim the width of the pool, then the length, then several lengths. She kept on trying, swimming, enduring day after day after day, until she won the gold medal for the butterfly stroke - one of the most difficult of all strokes in swimming - at the Olympics in Melbourne.

What if this champion had not been encouraged at age five to achieve, continue, overcome, and pray? What a tremendous asset were parents who assisted her in the importance of today and now in preparation for all of her tomorrows. Friends said she always took time to give thanks to her mom and dad for constant encouragement. Someone had taught her well to say "thank you."

In recalling some of the Saviors well-known teachings, the word &lt;i&gt;now &lt;/i&gt;can be appropriately added to emphasize their impact.

John 14:15: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" - NOW.

Mark 16:15: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" - NOW.

Luke 18:22: "Come, follow me" - NOW.

Truly, if we love God, we will serve him now, and give thanks now.

There are those among us, though they would deny it, who are hungry for fellowship and activity in the Church today. They need us and we need them. It is our duty and blessing to help them find the way now. We and they are Gods sheep, and we can best be fed and led together. Today is the time to let them know we care and that the Lord loves them. He stands anxious to forgive and welcome in the processes of appreciation. God give us the courage to act now. God give us the courage to give thanks.

There is an urgency today for all of us to take time for God. Wise are those who will use Gods ways now to insure his eternal companionship tomorrow. The time to become acquainted and know God is today. To achieve true abundance, life must be lived a day at a time in Gods companionship.

As we take time for God, we will become more like him. Robert Louis Stevenson once said, "Saints are sinners who kept trying."

It was our Savior Jesus Christ who said, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed" (John 8:31).

The message is loud and clear. If we work, serve, and improve now, each hour, each day will lead us onward and upward to a significant tomorrow in his paths. Today is the time for decision. Now is the time for action and gratitude.

Believe me when I tell you God is well pleased when he sees us using our time wisely. With some he is not well pleased because they fear being anxiously engaged in his paths. Some who are willing to listen to the prophets voice are disappointing to God when they lack the courage and desire to apply the counsel now, even today. We make a big mistake when we allow ourselves to believe it will be easier to start back tomorrow than to thank God for a new day and a new start.

May I share with you a thank-you that means very much to me. My quorum leader, an esteemed and respected associate, President Howard W. Hunter, has had great difficulty over the past number of years with his mobility. First he was confined to a bed, then a wheelchair, then a walker, and is presently able to stand and walk alone today. He has been a great example of patience, determination, and faith. Over these past few years as Elder Boyd K. Packer and I have sat closest to him in meetings and quorum duties, we help him to his feet after the meetings. Never, and I emphasize the word &lt;i&gt;never, &lt;/i&gt;have we not heard him say "thank you" when lifted or assisted in his coming and going. I appreciate this lesson. I appreciate his strength.

The use of the words &lt;i&gt;thank you &lt;/i&gt;is a sign of strength and greatness, not weakness. I have often hoped that young men worldwide in the Boy Scout program as well as learning "do a good turn daily" could have as a worthy companion to it "appreciate a good turn daily."

May God help us to properly adhere to this counsel: "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 58:7), I pray with gratitude in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

			<p>Thank you, President Seamons. Today I hope my message will bring new consideration and meaning to those two important words <i>thank you. </i>Frankly, over the years I have been troubled by the admonition contained in D&amp;C 98:1: "Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, <i>and in everything give thanks" </i>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>My inability to give thanks in all things, particularly those events or occasions that have caused disappointment, delay, and misunderstanding, has given me concern. My capacity to express thanks in everything has been quite inadequate. Without "the passing of time factor" I would have failed miserably.</p>
<p>Appreciation for all people and events that come into our lives is most important because it is Gods way of helping us to grow. The ultimate maturity is being able to feel and express appreciation promptly, being fully aware of the value and importance, and showing gratitude for it. How does God feel about giving thanks? In the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments" (D&amp;C 59:21).</p>
<p>Would you like to have Gods wrath raised against you? Would you like to have God angry with you? It can happen, and it will happen if we fail to show gratitude. Why does the lack of appreciation offend God and kindle his wrath? Not because he needs necessarily to see and hear our thanks, but because he knows an absence of appreciation on the part of anyone causes personal stagnation. Our growth and our progress are delayed when we fail to feel and express a sincere thank-you.</p>
<p>May we think for a few moments about occasions and situations where we actually say, "Thank thee, God, for the people and events that have come into our lives that have made it possible for us to develop and grow and mature, yes, for all people, for all conditions, and for all circumstances that allow us to give thanks to human beings and situations for what they can do and will mean to us."</p>
<p>How do you measure up in giving thanks in everything? Let me lead your minds into a few areas where hesitation or delay may leave you quiet instead of expressing present-time gratitude.</p>
<p>How well do you do in giving thanks for yet unanswered prayers? Are you able to give thanks to God when there is delay or silence in matters that are of great concern to you? We would remind you as you ponder and yearn for quick responses to important needs that sometimes the right answer could be no answer.</p>
<p>Are you able to give thanks for dress codes and conduct standards that seem to be restrictive and unnecessary for your personal needs?</p>
<p>It takes a certain amount of courage and maturity to thank in your heart and in words those who would teach modesty and good grooming by lofty standards and personal respect. Are you able to say "thank you" for enrollment in an institution of higher education, even BYU, and for administrators and instructors who expect you to better manage self-discipline and long-range priorities?</p>
<p>Can you bring yourself to give thanks for campus guidelines that seem to be just a little much? Are you wise enough to give thanks when you are inconvenienced by regulations that appear to take away freedom of choice? Are you able to give thanks for a campus honor system that is unique and demanding? Sorry but true, some of us would rather murmur than measure up. You are special students and friends who can and will, I hope, someday be able to give thanks for guidelines that on some occasions may seem unimportant and unnecessary, yet are self-discipline builders.</p>
<p>Are you able to accept a responsibility, particularly one that seems beyond your grasp and comprehension, with a simple "Thank you, Heavenly Father" for an unplanned calling? When I think of my being named a member of the Council of Twelve, I never remember over the years ever saying, "Thank you, Father in Heaven, for this calling." Many, many are the times I have thanked him for his trust, strength, and guidance, but never for the calling. Perhaps someday I will be mature enough to so declare. In the meantime, as I grow older and, I hope, wiser, the thank-you will continue to be for ongoing support.</p>
<p>Can you give thanks when physical limitations are constant and trying? I am thinking of a close friend of mine who died recently. He spent the majority of his life in a wheelchair. Shortly before he passed away, we had an intimate conversation. He said, among other things, "Looking back now, I am glad for the pluses of wheelchair life. It brought special experiences, people, opportunities, and tender relationships I would have never experienced if my mobility had not been restricted."</p>
<p>Can you give thanks when you are trying to climb an extra high mountain in your life of hills and valleys? Oftentimes we pray for strength to make it to the summit in lifes journeys, and the Lord seemingly adds elephant-sized burdens to our backs to carry up steep and trying paths.</p>
<p>Can you give thanks in grief? Can you express appreciation to God for sustaining power when certain pain and anguish seem to be beyond your power to cope?</p>
<p>Can you give thanks when appropriate discipline comes into your life? Many of us have a tendency to complain rather than conform to needed repentance procedures. Can you give thanks when a decision or ruling against you seems unfair and unreasonable? Some of us give thanks in victories, but never in defeat or undeserved delays.</p>
<p>Can you give thanks sincerely each time you give a blessing on your daily food?</p>
<p>Recently I had an urgent challenging assignment. It was not family, neighbor, or church related. It was a new experience. I felt ill-prepared. After a crash preparation procedure and humble prayer, we somehow successfully completed the taxing task. Upon returning to my office, I knelt down and was impressed to utter only two words, "Thank you."</p>
<p>Can you thank God on a continuing basis for people who share challenges, love, and lift?</p>
<p>Let us take the time for thank-yous while we may be heard and others are able to hear.</p>
<p>I have in my possession two letters, among others, that are years old. They are cherished thank-you notes, simple but enduring. One is from Frank Riggs, Jr., of Montgomery, Alabama. His came following a multistake conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Frank is a returned missionary from Denmark. He came home early when multiple sclerosis struck his healthy body.</p>
<p><i>Dear Elder Ashton:</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you for the thoughts and spirit you shared at our multistake conference this past weekend in Atlanta. It was a fairly strenuous experience for me with my limitations, but well worth the effort. Maintaining a level of involvement in service-related activity is very important to me - I am perniciously vulnerable, as one might guess, and determined to avoid the quagmire of self-concern, and your closing remarks yesterday gave me a fresh awareness of my possibilities in this area.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you for reading my letter. It was no great chore to write it, though the job had to be done somewhat piecemeal. Sorry about the misstrikes, but, as we say, "Thems the breaks." And I tried to do my best.</i></p>
<p>Bedridden and with little or no use of his arms and legs, he put the correspondence together with his typewriter and a pen. He typed his letter to me with the movement of his head moving the pen in his mouth.</p>
<p>The other letter came to me from an FBI agent in New York. He said, "I am here involved in a very, very important case. The days are long and the nights are longer because I am away from my family. I have had a little bit of time to think. As I have been thinking, I am impressed to write you a letter."</p>
<p>In the letter he didnt say, "I am thankful you are a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles." He said, "I want to thank you for what you did for me when I was a deacon, teaching me to be true to myself, my family, and my Church. I will never forget your interest in me. You taught me to try and be a one hundred percenter. Thank you."</p>
<p>As we visit with missionaries, we often ask them to stand up and tell us where they are from, bear their testimonies, and tell us about their companions and their parents. This is a great experience in learning about them and what their thought processes are and what their senses of values are.</p>
<p>I recall one missionary standing up and saying, "I have been in the mission field nine months, and I have had five companions." With a quivering chin and a choked-up voice, he said, "Never once in nine months have I had a companion who told me he loved me or thanked me for what I was doing for him. I hope and pray that someday, somehow, Ill have a companion who will tell me that he loves me and openly expresses gratitude."</p>
<p>No matter where we come from, no matter what our family conditions are, we should learn and be appreciative of those circumstances that can build and lift us.</p>
<p>I recall another missionary who said, "Two weeks before I was to go see my bishop and get the missionary forms and papers processed, I had some doubts. I had some questions about the future and even about the Church. I walked into the living room and interrupted my father, who was watching television, and said, Dad, Im not so sure about this Joseph Smith business. Im not so sure I know the Church is true. Im not so sure I want to go out and represent it. I have a lot of questions, and I have a lot of misgivings.</p>
<p>"When I said that, my father walked over and turned off the television, took the cigarette he had in his hand and smashed it in the ashtray, took the can of beer he had in his other hand and put it down on the table, and said, Son, I want you to know that I dont do very much about it, but I know that the Church of Jesus Christ is true and that Joseph Smith is a prophet. I want you to hear me say it because I know that better than most anything else in this world."</p>
<p>This young man then said, "I want my father to know that I appreciate him. He has some habits that hes not proud of. He has some habits that Im not proud of. But he is my father, and he has a testimony. Im pleased I even told him on that occasion Thank you for being my dad."</p>
<p>That kind of appreciation, that kind of maturity, will not only help a missionary to grow and develop, but will also be a great anchor in lifes paths. A sincere thank-you will cause most of us to share and perform more worthily in the days that follow.</p>
<p>The most common question missionaries ask me is, "Elder Ashton, what can I do to get my mother or father or brother or sister more active in the Church? I realize now what they are missing and what they need. What can I do to get them active in the Church? What can I do to get them to become members of the Church?"</p>
<p>In every case and every situation I have taken the opportunity to say, "The best way to get your family members active in the Church or to become members is to tell them thank you for all they do to support you and tell them how much you love them." We need to express appreciation on a continuing basis, to love family members and neighbors into the Church.</p>
<p>John Powell shares this touching experience:</p>
<p><i>It was the day my father died. . . . In the small hospital room, I was supporting him in my arms, when . . . my father slumped back, and I lowered his head gently onto the pillow. I . . . told my mother . . . :</i></p>
<p><i>"Its all over, Mom. Dad is dead."</i></p>
<p><i>She startled me. I will never know why these were her first words to me after his death. My mother said: "Oh, he was so proud of you. He loved you so much."</i></p>
<p><i>Somehow I knew . . . that these words were saying something very important to me. They were like a sudden shaft of light, like a startling thought I had never before absorbed. Yet there was a definite edge of pain, as though I were going to know my father better in death than I had ever known him in life.</i></p>
<p><i>Later, while a doctor was verifying death, I was leaning against the wall in the far corner of the room, crying softly. A nurse came over to me and put a comforting arm around me. I couldnt talk through my tears. I wanted to tell her: "Im not crying because my father is dead. Im crying because my father never told me that he loved me. Of course, I was expected to know these things. I was expected to know the great part I played in his life and the great part I occupied in his heart, but he never told me." Never once a thank-you.</i></p>
<p>In all that he has done, the Savior has indicated the importance of thanks. Here are a few short quotations from the scriptures that should be helpful as we give new thought to the importance of vocalizing appreciation.</p>
<p>"He took the cup, and gave thanks" (Matthew 26:27).</p>
<p>"He took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks" (Matthew 15:36).</p>
<p>"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;C 59:7).</p>
<p>"Ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with" (D&amp;C 46:32).</p>
<p>"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, . . . and be ye thankful" (Colossians 3:15).</p>
<p>"Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks" (D&amp;C 98:1).</p>
<p>"When thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God" (Alma 37:37).</p>
<p>What a great day it will be in our lives when we can know the blessings of spontaneous gratitude and what it means to us!</p>
<p>Appreciation of companion, appreciation of sweetheart, appreciation of husband and wife, education, and lofty standards is so important. It is a most important ingredient in a happy marriage. Many a family, many a marriage is broken because of a lack of appreciation. The most mature and successful people who participate in marriage are those who understand that a sincere and frequent thank-you is love in one of its most powerful displays. What a strength it is to have a companion who feels and expresses appreciation! Too many times I have heard people say, "My marriage was terminated primarily because my husband (or wife) didnt appreciate anything I ever did for him. No matter what I did, there was no thanks!"</p>
<p>Gods love for us was so great that it was possible for him to endure and look upon the sufferings of his Only Begotten Son. We should be eternally grateful that God gave to us his Son, our Savior and Redeemer. Without him and his love and sacrifice, we could never be glorified in his eternal presence. The greatest gift of all, and the one for which we should be most appreciative, is the gift of his Son to us for purposes and realizations that we little comprehend today but should better understand with each passing hour.</p>
<p>How do we show thanks for Gods great gifts? How do we show appreciation for the gifts of parents, brothers, sisters, companions, friends, and associates? By a sincere and appropriate thank-you. By our lives, by our works, and by constant words of thanks and a willingness to acknowledge blessings and favors from him and others.</p>
<p>Years ago, when the Olympics were held in Melbourne, Australia, in the spotlight on the winners platform one day there stood a beautiful, tall, blonde American girl. She was being presented a gold medal, symbolic of first place in worldwide competition. Tears ran down her cheeks as she accepted the recognition. Many thought she was touched by the victory ceremony; the thing they did not know was the story of her determination, self-discipline, and daily action.</p>
<p>At the age of five she had polio. When the disease left her body, she couldnt use her arms or legs. Her parents took her daily to a swimming pool where they hoped the water would help hold her arms up as she tried to use them again. When she could lift her arms out of the water with her own power, she cried for joy. Next she lifted her legs out of the water. Then her goal was to swim the width of the pool, then the length, then several lengths. She kept on trying, swimming, enduring day after day after day, until she won the gold medal for the butterfly stroke - one of the most difficult of all strokes in swimming - at the Olympics in Melbourne.</p>
<p>What if this champion had not been encouraged at age five to achieve, continue, overcome, and pray? What a tremendous asset were parents who assisted her in the importance of today and now in preparation for all of her tomorrows. Friends said she always took time to give thanks to her mom and dad for constant encouragement. Someone had taught her well to say "thank you."</p>
<p>In recalling some of the Saviors well-known teachings, the word <i>now </i>can be appropriately added to emphasize their impact.</p>
<p>John 14:15: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" - NOW.</p>
<p>Mark 16:15: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" - NOW.</p>
<p>Luke 18:22: "Come, follow me" - NOW.</p>
<p>Truly, if we love God, we will serve him now, and give thanks now.</p>
<p>There are those among us, though they would deny it, who are hungry for fellowship and activity in the Church today. They need us and we need them. It is our duty and blessing to help them find the way now. We and they are Gods sheep, and we can best be fed and led together. Today is the time to let them know we care and that the Lord loves them. He stands anxious to forgive and welcome in the processes of appreciation. God give us the courage to act now. God give us the courage to give thanks.</p>
<p>There is an urgency today for all of us to take time for God. Wise are those who will use Gods ways now to insure his eternal companionship tomorrow. The time to become acquainted and know God is today. To achieve true abundance, life must be lived a day at a time in Gods companionship.</p>
<p>As we take time for God, we will become more like him. Robert Louis Stevenson once said, "Saints are sinners who kept trying."</p>
<p>It was our Savior Jesus Christ who said, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed" (John 8:31).</p>
<p>The message is loud and clear. If we work, serve, and improve now, each hour, each day will lead us onward and upward to a significant tomorrow in his paths. Today is the time for decision. Now is the time for action and gratitude.</p>
<p>Believe me when I tell you God is well pleased when he sees us using our time wisely. With some he is not well pleased because they fear being anxiously engaged in his paths. Some who are willing to listen to the prophets voice are disappointing to God when they lack the courage and desire to apply the counsel now, even today. We make a big mistake when we allow ourselves to believe it will be easier to start back tomorrow than to thank God for a new day and a new start.</p>
<p>May I share with you a thank-you that means very much to me. My quorum leader, an esteemed and respected associate, President Howard W. Hunter, has had great difficulty over the past number of years with his mobility. First he was confined to a bed, then a wheelchair, then a walker, and is presently able to stand and walk alone today. He has been a great example of patience, determination, and faith. Over these past few years as Elder Boyd K. Packer and I have sat closest to him in meetings and quorum duties, we help him to his feet after the meetings. Never, and I emphasize the word <i>never, </i>have we not heard him say "thank you" when lifted or assisted in his coming and going. I appreciate this lesson. I appreciate his strength.</p>
<p>The use of the words <i>thank you </i>is a sign of strength and greatness, not weakness. I have often hoped that young men worldwide in the Boy Scout program as well as learning "do a good turn daily" could have as a worthy companion to it "appreciate a good turn daily."</p>
<p>May God help us to properly adhere to this counsel: "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;C 58:7), I pray with gratitude in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Last October I was assigned to speak in general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question "What lack I yet?" and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.
In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, "Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer."
Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to "be more cheerful" or to "smile more often" or to "count their blessings."
I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children to be happy.
 Latter-day prophets have taught that happiness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.
One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing "an unconscious smile."1 I have known people like that - individuals who are continually smiling without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.
When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.
What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being "temple worthy," what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.
For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.2 It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day - and then to make an effort to increase it.
The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet - and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.
In the scriptures we are commanded to "thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;C 59:7), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to kee</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was "My Heavenly Father Loves Me" (Childrens Songbook, 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song - "hear[ing] the song of a bird," "look[ing] at the blue . . . sky," having eyes to "see The color of butterfly wings," and feeling "the wind as it rushes by." Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.
The Beauty of Education
Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, "What is a SWKT?" I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.
Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.
Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.
During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a BYU Magazine article several years ago, the following was published about this time:
The university wrestled with its own financial challenges - including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled. ["Stories of the Century," comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, BYU Magazine, Winter 19992000, 24]
The BYU Magazine article also quoted Wilford Lees memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:
The school was struggling. . . . They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the students tuition. . . .

		            <span class="card__excerpt">Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. . . . Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.1
President Samuelson, members of the administration, students, and faculty, I appreciate the opportunity of being with you today. I am especially grateful to have my wife, Sandra, and my family with me today as well.
In the latter part of the 19th century, Johnson Oatman Jr., a Methodist preacher, penned the following words, which we know as the hymn "Count Your Blessings." I quote from the second verse:
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; evry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.2
I know those words are familiar, and I believe you accept them at face value: Counting our blessings and being grateful for them has a positive impact - not just upon our lives but upon the lives of those to whom we show our gratitude. Remember what Mark Twain said: "I can live for two months on a good compliment."3
The Study of Gratitude
It now appears that some psychologists have arrived at the same conclusion. Being mindfully grateful for our blessings and expressing gratitude has a strong correlation with increasing our personal happiness and well-being. For example, Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading scholars in the scientific study of gratitude, said the following:
It is possible that psychology has ignored gratitude because it appears, on the surface, to be a very obvious emotion, lacking in interesting complications: we receive a gift - from friends, from family, from God - and then we feel pleasurably grateful. But while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness. Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change peoples lives.4
Dr. Emmons and his colleagues found scientific proof that people who practice gratitude through activities such as keeping a gratitude journal are more loving, forgiving, and optimistic about the future. They exercise more frequently, report fewer illnesses, and generally feel better about their lives.5
For example, in a ten-week study Dr. Emmons randomly assigned participants into one of three groups. One group of participants was encouraged to briefly record five things they were grateful for each week; a second group was asked to describe five hassles or negative events th</span>

		            <span class="card__excerpt">In June 1831 the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith to travel to Missouri. The Prophet records,
On the 19th of June, . . . I started from Kirtland, Ohio, for the land of Missouri, agreeable to the commandment before received, wherein it was promised that if we were faithful, the land of our inheritance, even the place for the city of the New Jerusalem, should be revealed.1
The group travelled about 870 miles - 500 of it on foot. Im not sure about you, but the last time I walked 500 miles was, well, I dont believe Ive ever walked 500 miles. The trip took this group about one month to complete.
This was a time of great expectation and anticipation. The Church had been organized, the priesthood had been restored, the Book of Mormon had been published, and now the Lord was gathering His people to Zion. The Saints were thrilled by the possibilities.
The Lord then taught the Saints one of the principles of the gospel that would be crucial for them to learn:
And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.2
While the Saints were prosperous and things were good, this was not a difficult requirement. However, the events that would occur over the next few years would prove to be a test of the most valiant Saint. How difficult it would be, while mobs were raging, family and friends were being murdered, and innocent Saints were being driven from their homes, to confess the Lords hand in all things and to obey His commandments. I have chosen this scripture as the basis for my talk today.
We live in an exciting time. Never in the history of the earth has our Heavenly Father given so much to His children. I fear that with our abundance of luxuries - our automobiles and cell phones, our video games and GPS navigation systems, our lives of plenty and ease - we sometimes forget to confess the Lords hand in all things. Let me give just a small glimpse of how truly blessed we are.
President Spencer W. Kimball was the president of the Church for much of the time I was growing up. He was an incredible man who had a great vision of the future of the Church. In an address he gave in 1974, he said,
I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hands inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse.3
I remember as a young man hearing this statement and wondering what the Lord had in store for us. President Kimballs statement of us hardly having a glimpse was more accurate than I imagined. As I look at where technology has gone since that time, I am absolutely amazed. Lets take a look at some of the ways in which this prophecy has been and is being fulfilled.
From the days of Adam until 1805, relatively few technological innovations occurred. We did have the wheel, gunpowder, the abacus, and the p</span>
