NOTES:
 - all the data in this directory has been normalized.
 - f-measure (I believe) is the metric we should use for evaluating model
   performance. This measure is included in all the output files.

    all_features contains the results of the models (bayesnet, j48, mlp and
    naive bayes) when ran on the entire dataset.

    After running models on the entire data set, I ran various feature selection
    algorithms in weka.

    correlation.txt: listing of the pearson correlation between each attribute
                     and the output class.
    infogain.txt: like correlation.txt, but with information gain instead of
                  pearson correlation.
    wrapperforward_10cv.txt: an optimal subset of features chosen by a wrapper
                             algorithm. This algorithm evaluated each subset
                             with j48 and optimized f-measure. The entire
                             wrapper algorithm ran 10 times (leaving one fold
                             out each time), and then the output is the number
                             of times each attribute was ultimately included in
                             the optimal subset.
    wrapperforward_training.txt: like wrapperforward_10cv.txt, but instead of
                                 running 10 times, it only ran once. Output is
                                 a single optimal subset of features.
