The title of my presentation is “Angels, Chariots,  and the Lord of Hosts.”<sup>1</sup> Please know that I have, through various means, sought for the  Spirit of the Lord. Please know also that the Lord’s angels exist and are empowered by Jesus Christ  through His infinite Atonement.
<h2><b>The Ministry of Angels</b></h2>
Since the days of Adam and Eve  angels have had significant responsibilities in the Lord’s great plan of happiness. Angels figure  prominently in ancient and modern scripture. Angels have ministered to or communicated with such  notables as Adam, Hagar (see Genesis 16:7–11), Manoah’s wife (see Judges 13:3, 6, 19–21), Daniel,  Mary the mother of Jesus (see Luke 1:26–38), Mary Magdalene, Salome, Joanna, Mary the mother of  James, other women (see Mark 16:4–6; Luke 24:2–4; John 20:11–12), Peter, Paul, John the Revelator,  and many others. Angels have also ministered to Book of Mormon characters, including Nephi (see  1 Nephi 11:14; 2 Nephi 4:24), King Benjamin (see Mosiah 3:2), Alma the Younger (see Mosiah 27:10–11;  Alma 8:14), Amulek (see Alma 10:7), Samuel the Lamanite (see Helaman 13:7), and  others.

Furthermore, in our own dispensation prophets and apostles have testified of the  eminence and considerable standing of angels. In fact, our dispensation has been a period of  extraordinary angelic activity. Joseph Smith received dozens of communications from angels.  Additional Church authorities and others have been recipients of angelic  communications.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was restored, in part,  when angels imparted revelations and truths to the Prophet Joseph Smith. A passage in the Doctrine  and Covenants summarizes:

<i>The voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel,  and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all declaring  their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power  of their priesthood.</i> [D&amp;C 128:21]

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland reminded us that  it is appropriate to speak about angels. He wrote, “I believe we need to speak of and believe in and  bear testimony of the ministry of angels more than we sometimes do.”<sup>2</sup>

For a  definition of angels, see the Bible Dictionary. In this presentation I will refer to the Lord’s  angels unless otherwise stated.
<h2><b>The Angels of the Lord of Hosts</b></h2>
How many angels are  there? There are <i>hosts</i> of angels. The Old Testament expression “Lord of hosts” sometimes  refers to the Lord of hosts of angels. The Bible Dictionary states: “The Lord of Sabaoth was a title  of Jehovah; the hosts were the armies of Israel (1 Sam. 17:45), but also included the angelic armies  of heaven.”<sup>3</sup>Hebrew lexicons agree with this interpretation. One prominent Hebrew lexicon  states that the term <i>Lord of hosts</i> sometimes refers to “the heavenly beings” of the  Lord<sup>4</sup> or “the heavenly entourage” of the Lord.<sup>5</sup> Another Hebrew lexicon agrees  with this definition, referring to a host as an “(organized body) of  angels.”<sup>6</sup>

The title “Lord of hosts” is so important that it is found some 250  times in the Old Testament; Isaiah alone used the term about fifty times. This title, then, is a  frequent reminder that the Lord has hosts of angels. How many angels belong to the Lord of hosts of  angels? The singular <i>host</i>, by definition, refers to “a large number of people or  things.”<sup>7</sup> The plural, <i>hosts,</i> multiplies this number. The Lord of hosts of angels  refers to immense numbers.

Other passages of scripture also indicate that there are great  numbers of the Lord’s angels. For example, Lehi envisioned “God sitting upon his throne, surrounded  with numberless concourses of angels” (1 Nephi 1:8). Two passages of scripture—Hebrews 12:22 and  Doctrine and Covenants 76:67—use the expression “an innumerable company of angels.” Furthermore,  John the Revelator recorded:

<i>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels  round about the throne . . . : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and  thousands of thousands.</i> [Revelation 5:11]

Indeed, ten thousand times ten thousand  angels, which equals 100 million, symbolizes a great number. To sum up, there are numberless  concourses of angels, an innumerable company of angels, and hosts of angels—all of whom are in the  service of our Lord and God.
<h2><b>Angels as Agents of Power</b></h2>
Angels are agents of power.  Each of the Lord’s angels possesses extraordinary capabilities and powers, making them formidable  beings. Their power ultimately exists because of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Consider the  following examples of the power of angels:

When Daniel was cast into the lions’ den, a  stone was placed over the den’s opening to prevent Daniel’s escape. Then, to ensure that possible  coconspirators with Daniel would not remove the stone without detection, the king and his officers  used their signets to seal the stone (see Daniel 6:17). Had the seals been broken during the night,  the king and his officers could have claimed deception or trickery on the part of Daniel. But  neither the rock nor the seals prevented the angel from entering the den and stopping the lions’  mouths. We note that the angel was not only empowered to save Daniel but that the angel himself was  also immune from the lions’ destruction. Because of Daniel’s faith and righteousness, the angel  saved him from a horrific death. Daniel would later testify, “My God hath sent his angel, and hath  shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in  me” (Daniel 6:22).

We live during a day of wars and rumors of wars. News organizations  regularly report conflicts taking place in various parts of the world. However, we as Latter-day  Saints should have a high degree of comfort in knowing the power of the Lord’s angels with regard to  such conflicts. The Bible sets forth the following account of a powerful angel.

During the  reign of King Hezekiah the Assyrian army was advancing toward Jerusalem with the intent of  conquering it. With scores of thousands of enemy soldiers camped outside of Jerusalem’s gates,  waiting to destroy the city’s inhabitants, Hezekiah petitioned the Lord through prayer in the  temple. In response to Hezekiah’s humble prayer, the Lord sent his prophet Isaiah to the king,  promising deliverance from the Assyrian army. Soon thereafter “the angel of the Lord went forth, and  smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand” (Isaiah 37:36; see  also Isaiah 37:33–35; 2 Chronicles 32:21). It is sometimes difficult to comprehend such  extraordinary dominance: one angel versus some 185,000 disciplined soldiers—and the angel was  victorious. Such an angelic operation is permitted only according to the Lord’s divine  will.

In addition to these two examples of angels operating as agents of power during the  Old Testament period, I will provide a modern example of a powerful heavenly messenger in the life  of President Harold B. Lee. When President Lee was serving as the president of the Church, he shared  an experience that occurred while he and his wife were traveling on an airplane. They had been  visiting a mission, and both were impressed to return home earlier than they had planned. As  President and Sister Lee were sitting in the airplane, homeward bound, President Lee received a  blessing from an unseen person. He related:

<i>As we approached a certain point en  route, someone laid his hand upon my head. I looked up; I could see no one. That happened again  before we arrived home, again with the same experience. Who it was, by what means or what medium, I  may never know, except I knew that I was receiving a blessing that I came a few hours later to know  I needed most desperately.</i>

. . . <i>Shortly</i> [after we arrived home], <i>there came  massive hemorrhages which, had they occurred while we were in flight, I wouldn’t be here today  talking about it.</i>

<i>I know that there are powers divine that reach out when all other  help is not available. . . . Yes, I know that there are such  powers.</i><sup>8</sup>

The unseen person who gave President Lee a blessing  demonstrated extraordinary powers: he remained invisible, he knew where to find President Lee, he  knew of President Lee’s physical condition and of his need for a blessing, and he blessed the  prophet with priesthood power. Additionally, it is my opinion that this unseen person did not board  the plane as did other passengers, obtaining a passport, ticket, and boarding pass; showing his  photo ID; dealing with airport security; and so forth. It is entirely possible, knowing of the vast  power of angels, that this unseen person entered the plane through miraculous means. Such is the way  of heavenly beings.
<h2><b>Angels as Protectors of the Righteous</b></h2>
Not only are angels agents  of power, but they also serve as protective and reassuring forces for the righteous, as shown by the  symbol of chariots of fire. During my research on angels I have collected a number of accounts that  feature angels, horses, and chariots of fire. I will now provide a few examples.

We recall  from the Old Testament the attempt of Syria’s king to capture Elisha. During the night the king  surrounded Dothan with soldiers, horses, and chariots. When Elisha’s assistant awakened early in the  morning, he saw the armies that surrounded the city and cried out to Elisha, “Alas, my master! how  shall we do?”

Elisha replied by saying:

<i>Fear not: for they that be with us  are more than they that be with them.</i>

[After this reply,] <i>Elisha prayed, and said,  Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man;  and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about  Elisha.</i> [2 Kings 6:15–17]

This account signifies a demonstration of great power  and supremacy—a mountain full of horses and chariots of fire providing courage and protection to  Elisha and his servant.

Church authorities and others often liken this account to us.  President Henry B. Eyring, for example, provided us with the following  encouragement:

<i>I know that the promise of angels to bear us up is real. You  might want to bring to memory the assurance of Elisha to his frightened servant. That assurance is  ours when we feel close to being overwhelmed in our service. Elisha faced real and terrible  opposition. . . .</i>

<i>Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those  you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal  eyes.</i><sup>9</sup>

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland related the account of Elisha and  then applied this important story to each of us:

<i>In the gospel of Jesus Christ  we have help from both sides of the veil. When disappointment and discouragement strike—and they  will—we need to remember that if our eyes could be opened, we would see horses and chariots of fire  as far as the eye can see, riding at great speed to come to our protection. They will always be  there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham’s seed.</i><sup>10</sup>

The  account of Elisha reminds us also of when Elijah and Elisha were walking and talking near the Jordan  River, and “there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and  Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.” When Elisha witnessed this scene, he cried out, “My  father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof” (2 Kings 2:11–12). For multiple  reasons this is a marvelous and incredible show of power: a chariot of fire, horses of fire, and  Elijah ascending to heaven in a whirlwind create a magnificent scene.

On April 3, 1836,  this same Elijah visited Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. Joseph wrote,  “Another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven  without tasting death, stood before us” (D&amp;C 110:13).

The protective theme of horses  and chariots of fire continues in our day. Some individuals who attended the dedication of the  Kirtland Temple beheld angels, horses of fire, and chariots. The Prophet Joseph Smith recorded: “The  heavens were opened unto Elder Sylvester Smith, and he, leaping up, exclaimed: ‘The horsemen of  Israel and the chariots thereof.’”<sup>11</sup>

Additionally, Joseph Smith wrote that

<i>Elder Roger Orton saw a mighty angel riding upon a horse of fire, with a flaming  sword in his hand, followed by five others, encircle the house </i>[temple],<i> and protect the  Saints, even the Lord’s anointed, from the power of Satan and a host of evil spirits, which were  striving to disturb the Saints.</i><sup>12</sup>

This account makes it unmistakable  that the angels who encircled the temple did so to protect the Saints from Satan’s host of evil  spirits. This account also features angels with swords in their hands—a demonstration of angels’  power to protect us from harm and danger.

Angels with swords are found in the Old  Testament as well as in accounts during the Restoration. We are reminded, for instance, that Joseph  Smith envisioned

<i>Elder Brigham Young standing in a strange land, in the far south  and west, in a desert place, upon a rock in the midst of about a dozen men . . . , who appeared  hostile. He was preaching to them in their own tongue, and the angel of God standing above his head,  with a drawn sword in his hand, protecting him, but he did not see it.</i><sup>13</sup>
<h2><b>Angels  in This Dispensation</b></h2>
Many of the accounts of angels that I have shared today are  exceptional or unique. Most of us will never be protected by an angel in a lions’ den, nor will the  majority of us be privileged to see horses and chariots of fire. But we should bear in mind that  angelic communications are not reserved for those who lived during the ancient periods of the Old  Testament or the Book of Mormon, nor are such communications reserved only for prophets, apostles,  or notable women such as Hagar or Mary the mother of Jesus. Indeed, several of our Church  authorities have clearly taught that we who are laypersons may receive angelic communications  according to the divine will of our loving Heavenly Father. To this end I will cite President Boyd  K. Packer and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.

President Packer provided the following significant  statement:

<i>Angels attend the rank and file of the Church. . .  .</i>
<i>Who would dare to say that angels do not now attend the rank and file of the  Church who—</i>
<i>answer the calls to the mission fields,</i>
<i>teach the  classes,</i>
<i>pay their tithes and offerings,</i>
<i>seek for the records of  their forebears,</i>
<i>work in the temples,</i>
<i>raise their children in  faith,</i>
<i>and have brought this work through 150  years?</i><sup>14</sup>

This statement of President Packer’s clearly shows that  angels attend the Church’s rank and file as they raise children in faith, pay tithing, conduct  sacred temple work, teach classes, and more.

It is my understanding—based on more than  twenty years of research—that operations and ministrations of angels are largely unknown to mortals.  Angels can move about the earth conducting the Lord’s divine work, and they serve, minister, and  mingle among mortals, usually without our awareness. Most of us in mortality will never see an  angel. As Parley P. Pratt instructed, angels can “be present without being visible to  mortals.”<sup>15</sup> And Paul wrote, “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some  have entertained angels unawares” (Hebrews 13:2).

Before I cite Elder Oaks, I want to  share a personal item. During the 1990s my parents had a landline telephone that was state of the  art, high tech, and ultramodern. It was so technologically advanced that it had an internal memory  that would remember up to twenty phone numbers. After my parents entered the phone numbers of  friends or family into the phone’s memory, all my parents had to do was lift the receiver and push  the appropriate button, and the phone would automatically dial any of their children. What an  amazing miracle! Dad and Mom could be in contact with any one of their children in  seconds.

I will now refer to Elder Dallin H. Oaks’ conference talk. Elder Oaks presented  specific teachings on how angels may communicate to us who are mortals. His teachings apply to you  and to me:

<i>The ministering of angels can also be unseen. Angelic messages can be  delivered by a voice or merely by thoughts or feelings communicated to the mind. . .  .</i>

<i>Nephi described three manifestations of the ministering of angels when he  reminded his rebellious brothers that (1) they had “seen an angel,” (2) they had “heard his voice  from time to time,” and (3) also that an angel had “spoken unto [them] in a still small voice”  though they were “past feeling” and “could not feel his words” (1 Ne. 17:45). . . . Most angelic  communications are felt or heard rather than seen.</i><sup>16</sup>

Compared to the  aforementioned telephone, which is now a relic of the past, angelic communications are astounding  and remarkable. They are wonderful gifts from a loving Heavenly Father: visitations from beyond the  veil—unseen angels communicating to mortals by thoughts or by feelings—are spectacular gifts. As the  Book of Mormon teaches, “It is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men” (Moroni 7:37). The  telephone, of course, does not work by faith.

My research has uncovered instances in which  angels have provided temporal assistance to mortals. An angel, for example, provided food and water  to the prophet Elijah when he fled for his life from Jezebel (see 1 Kings 19:1–7). And here is a  modern example of an angel providing temporal assistance: Elder Heber C. Kimball related an occasion  when he and Brigham Young traveled together, conducting the Lord’s work. They started out with only  $13.50, but along the way they paid for a number of items, including travel, lodging, and meals. In  fact, they paid out over $87.00, although they had only had $13.50. Elder Kimball  stated:

<i>Brother Brigham often suspected that I put the money in his trunk or  clothes, thinking I had . . . money which I had not acquainted him with, but this was not so. The  money could only have been put in his trunk by some heavenly messenger who administered to our  necessities daily, as he knew we needed.</i><sup>17</sup>
<h2><b>Angels as Agents of  Love</b></h2>
All angels minister with heavenly love, and every angelic communication to the Saints  is a message of love. Oliver Cowdery personally witnessed the love of John the Baptist when John  appeared to him and Joseph Smith. Sometime after John’s visitation Oliver wrote that this angel’s  “love enkindled upon our souls.”<sup>18</sup> Decades later, in the April 1916 general conference,  President Joseph F. Smith spoke of the love of heavenly messengers:

<i>I believe we  move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. We are not  separate from them. . . . I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous  for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. . . .</i> <i>Their love for us and their desire  for our well being must be greater than that which we feel for  ourselves.</i><sup>19</sup>

I will now share two stories wherein angels  communicated love to mortals. At one point in his life Parley P. Pratt remained captive for months  in a Missouri dungeon. He was very discouraged. After fasting and praying for a number of days,  Elder Pratt experienced a powerful answer to his prayer. He wrote:

<i>A personage . . .  stood before me with a smile of compassion in every look, and pity mingled with the tenderest love  and sympathy in every expression of the countenance. . . . A well known voice saluted me, which I  readily recognized as that of the wife of my youth, who had for near two years been sweetly sleeping  where . . . the weary are at rest.</i><sup>20</sup>

This personage, as an angelic  messenger, delivered her message to Elder Pratt and then departed.

While on the subject of  female angels, I will share an important statement by President Brigham  Young:

<i>Suppose that a female angel were to come into your house and you had the  privilege of seeing her, how would she be dressed? . . . She would be neat and nice, her countenance  full of glory, brilliant, bright, and perfectly beautiful, and in every act her gracefulness would  charm the heart of every beholder. There is nothing needless about  her.</i><sup>21</sup>

The second account of an angel who communicated love comes  from President Ezra Taft Benson, who recounted an eternal love story of his wife’s parents. His  father-in-law, Carl Christian Amussen, a convert from Denmark, was a watchmaker and jeweler in Utah.  He passed away in 1902, leaving his wife, Barbara, a widow for forty years. In 1942 the deceased  Carl came to his wife to inform her of her approaching death. What a great blessing it was for her  to see her eternal companion for the first time in so many years. Carl appeared to Barbara and  informed her that she would pass away on the following Thursday. Barbara had no doubt that her  husband had appeared to her, nor did she doubt that she only had less than a week to live; in fact,  she began to make concrete plans for her death. On Sunday at church she bore her testimony and bid  the ward members good-bye. During the coming days she withdrew her savings from the bank, ordered  her casket from a local mortuary, paid her bills, and even had the power and water turned off at her  home. Then she went to her daughter Mabel’s home to await her passing.

President Benson  concluded:

<i>On the day of her passing, Mabel came into the room where her mother  was reclining on the bed. Her mother said, “Mabel, I feel a little bit drowsy. I feel I will go to  sleep. Do not disturb me if I sleep until the eventide.”</i>

<i>Those were her last words,  and she peacefully passed away.</i><sup>22</sup>

It is my testimony that angels are  agents of love, light, and power. The Lord’s angels exist because of Jesus Christ and His infinite  Atonement. I testify that angels appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I also testify that the  sacred work of angels continues in our day. In the name of Jesus Christ,  amen.
